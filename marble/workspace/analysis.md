# Problem Analysis

The task at hand is to provide a detailed analysis of the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that works by repeatedly breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. 

In the case of Merge Sort, it first divides the array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. This process is recursively done until we reach an array of size one, which is considered sorted. 

As for its time complexity, Merge Sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves. It can be represented by the recurrence relation: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n`, which when solved comes out to be `O(nLogn)`. This makes Merge Sort more efficient on large lists compared to other quadratic time complexity sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.

# Function Signature Design

A typical implementation of Merge Sort in a programming language like Python would have the following function signatures:

```python
def mergeSort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Implementation here

def merge(arr: List[int], l: int, m: int, r: int) -> List[int]:
    # Implementation here
```

- The `mergeSort` function takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of the array. 
- The `merge` function is a helper function used to merge two sorted halves of an array.

# Implementation Method

The implementation for the Merge Sort algorithm can be broken down into three main steps:

1. **Divide**: The `mergeSort` function first checks the base case, i.e. whether the length of the array is 1. If the length of the array is greater than 1, it calculates the mid-point of the array and recursively applies `mergeSort` on the two halves - from start to mid, and from mid+1 to end.

2. **Conquer**: After the array has been divided into subarrays of size 1, we start merging them while sorting at the same time. This is done using the `merge` function. 

3. **Combine**: The `merge` function takes in two sorted arrays and a helper array. It then compares the elements of the two sorted arrays one by one and puts the smaller one into the helper array. This is done until all elements from one or both arrays have been compared. Finally, it copies the remaining elements from the array that hasn't been fully traversed into the helper array. This helper array now contains the sorted and merged elements of the two arrays.

The above steps are repeated until the entire array is sorted.

## Test Strategy
This Python function takes two sorted arrays as input and merges them into a single sorted array. Here is the test strategy that can be used to verify the correctness and performance of the function.

1. Test Cases Categories:

   a. **Functional Test Cases:** These test cases will validate the basic functionality of the merge function. Test cases will include scenarios where the two arrays are of the same size, different sizes, and one or both of the arrays are empty.

   b. **Negative Test Cases:** These test cases will be used to test scenarios where the input is not as expected. This could include scenarios where the input is not an array or the array includes non-integer values.

   c. **Boundary Test Cases:** These test cases will be used to test the function at the boundary conditions. Scenarios could include very large arrays and very small arrays.

2. Edge Cases:

   a. Both input arrays are empty.
   
   b. One of the input arrays is empty.
   
   c. Input arrays contain negative numbers.
   
   d. Input arrays have duplicate numbers.

3. Performance Test Cases:

   a. **Load Testing:** Test the function with a large amount of data to see how it handles it. This could be arrays with hundreds of thousands or millions of elements.

   b. **Stress Testing:** Test the function under extreme workloads to see how it handles high stress and high loads. This could be done by providing very large arrays as input and see if it can handle it without crashing.

4. Error Handling Cases:

   a. The function should handle cases where the input is not an array. It should return an appropriate error message in such cases.
   
   b. The function should handle cases where the input array contains non-integer values. It should return an appropriate error message in this scenario as well.

   c. The function should be able to handle cases where the input arrays are not sorted. While the current implementation doesn't handle this, it could be a useful enhancement. The function could either sort the arrays before merging or return an error message.

## Test Strategy
Test Strategy:

I. Test Cases Categories

1. Functional Test Cases: Verify the functionality of the mergeSort function. Here, we provide various inputs to the function and check if it sorts the array correctly.

2. Negative Test Cases: Provide invalid inputs and check if the function can handle them. For example, passing null or non-integer values.

3. Boundary Test Cases: Validate the function against the boundary values. For instance, providing an array of maximum possible length or an array with minimum possible length (empty array).

II. Edge Cases

1. Test the function with an already sorted array, the function should return the same array.

2. Test the function with a reversely sorted array, the function should return a sorted array in ascending order.

3. Test the function with an array having all elements the same. The function should return the same array as the input.

III. Performance Test Cases

1. Test the function by providing a large size array. This will help to check how well the function performs with large data.

2. Test the function with arrays having random values. This will help to check the performance of the function with unsorted data.

IV. Error Handling Cases

1. Test the function with a null input. The function should handle this gracefully.

2. Test the function with non-integer values in the array. The function should handle this and return an error message, or handle it in a way as per the function's requirements. 

3. Test the function with an array having one or more null values. The function should handle this gracefully. 

Remember, the strategy may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the function and the system in which it is being used.

## Test Strategy
Test Strategy:

Test Cases Categories:
1. Functional Test Cases: 
   - Test with a normal list of integers to see if it sorts correctly.
   - Test with a list of negative integers to see if it sorts correctly.
   - Test with a list of decimal numbers to check if the function can handle and sort them correctly.
   - Test with an empty list to see if the function can handle it and returns an empty list.
   - Test with a list with duplicate numbers to verify the function can sort it correctly.

Edge Cases:
   - Test with a list of only 1 element to see if the function can handle it and returns the list without error.
   - Test with a very large list to see if the function can handle it and how long it takes to sort the list.
   - Test with a list in reversed order to see if the function can sort it correctly.
   - Test with a list that is already sorted to see if the function returns the original list without modifying it.

Performance Test Cases:
   - Test with different sizes of lists (from small to very large) to see how the function performs and the time it takes to sort the list.

Error Handling Cases:
   - Test with a list of non-integer and non-float values to see if the function gives an error.
   - Test with a null value to see if the function can handle it and returns an error.
   - Test with a list of mixed types of values (integers, floats, strings) to verify if the function returns an error.
