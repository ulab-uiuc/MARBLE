# Problem Analysis

A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where every node follows certain rules to ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.

The rules are:

1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. All leaves (NULL) are black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. Every path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.

The methods that need to be implemented for this tree structure are:

1. Insertion - This method will add a new node to the tree and will rearrange the tree if necessary to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.
2. Deletion - This method will remove a node from the tree and will rearrange the tree if necessary to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.
3. Search - This method will find a node in the tree.
4. Traversal - This method will visit every node in the tree in a specific order.

# Function Design

1. Insertion Function - The function will take a key and a value as input. It will create a new node, assign the key and value to the new node, and insert the node in the correct place in the tree. Then it will rearrange the tree if necessary to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

2. Deletion Function - The function will take a key as input. It will find the node with the same key and remove it from the tree. Then it will rearrange the tree if necessary to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

3. Search Function - The function will take a key as input. It will traverse the tree and return the node if it finds a node with the same key. If it does not find a node with the same key, it will return NULL.

4. Traversal Function - The function does not need any input. It will visit every node in the tree in a specific order (in-order, pre-order, post-order, or level-order) and print the key and value of each node.

# Implementation Steps

1. Define the structure of a node in the Red-Black tree. Each node will have a key, a value, a color, and pointers to the parent, left child, and right child.

2. Implement the rotation functions. There are two rotations: left rotation and right rotation. These functions are used to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties during insertion and deletion.

3. Implement the Insertion function. First, insert the node as in a regular binary search tree. Then, color the node red and check the Red-Black Tree properties. If any property is violated, fix the violation with rotations and/or recoloring.

4. Implement the Deletion function. First, delete the node as in a regular binary search tree. Then, check the Red-Black Tree properties. If any property is violated, fix the violation with rotations and/or recoloring.

5. Implement the Search function. This function can be implemented as in a regular binary search tree.

6. Implement the Traversal function. This function can be implemented as in a regular binary search tree.

7. Test the functions with various inputs to make sure they work correctly.
