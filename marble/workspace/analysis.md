## Problem Analysis
- The task requires implementing a merge sort algorithm in Python to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
- Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input list into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- The main components needed are a main merge sort function, a helper function for merging two sorted arrays.
- Edge cases to consider include:
  - Empty input list
  - List with only one element
  - List with duplicate elements
  - Large input lists to test performance
- The optimal approach involves dividing the list in half until each sublist has one element, then merging the sublists in a sorted manner.

## Function Signature Design
```python
def merge_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    pass

def merge(left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    pass
```

## Implementation Method
- **Step 1: Implement the merge function:**
  - The merge function will take two sorted lists as input and merge them into a single sorted list.
  
- **Step 2: Implement the merge_sort function:**
  - The merge_sort function will recursively divide the input list into halves until each sublist has one element, then merge the sorted sublists using the merge function.
  
- **Step 3: Test the implementation:**
  - Create comprehensive test cases including edge cases like empty list, list with one element, list with duplicate elements, and large input lists to verify correctness and performance.

Here is a sample implementation:
```python
from typing import List

def merge(left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

def merge_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

# Test the implementation
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

This implementation follows the divide-and-conquer approach of the merge sort algorithm and includes a main merge sort function and a helper merge function. It is efficient and follows Python best practices. Test cases should be added to validate correctness and performance.
