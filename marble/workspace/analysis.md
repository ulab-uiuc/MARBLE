# Problem Analysis

The task at hand is to implement the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. In Merge Sort, we break the given array into two halves, sort them separately and then merge them. This process is done recursively.

# Function Signature Design

The Merge Sort function can be designed with the following signature:
```python
def merge_sort(array: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```
Here, `array` is the input list of integers that needs to be sorted, and the function returns the sorted array.

In addition to this, we will also need a helper function to merge two sorted arrays:
```python
def merge(left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```
Here, `left` and `right` are the two sorted arrays that need to be merged, and the function returns the merged array.

# Implementation Method

The Merge Sort algorithm can be implemented as follows:

1. Base Case: If the array has 1 or 0 elements, it is already sorted. So we return the array.

2. Recursive Case: We find the middle point of the array and divide the array into two halves. We recursively sort the two halves (using Merge Sort).

3. Merge: We merge the two sorted halves. This is done by maintaining a pointer to the smallest unprocessed element in both halves, and repeatedly choosing the smaller of the two elements pointed to by the pointers and moving the pointers forward.

The helper function 'merge' can be implemented using two pointers (one for each array). We initialize a new array to hold the result. We then run a loop until one or both of the pointers reach the end of their respective arrays. In each iteration, we compare the elements at the current pointer positions in the two arrays, and append the smaller one to the result array and increment the respective pointer. After the loop, if there are still some elements left in one of the arrays, we append all of them to the result.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Test Strategy
Test Strategy:

Test Cases Categories:

1. **Functional Tests**: These tests will validate the correct implementation of the merge sort algorithm. They will include tests for sorting numbers in ascending order, descending order, and testing with various data points including negative numbers and zero.

2. **Boundary Tests**: These tests will check the behavior of the algorithm at the boundaries. They will include tests for sorting an empty list, a list with one element, and a list with a large number of elements.

3. **Negative Tests**: These tests will check the behavior of the algorithm with invalid input. They will include tests for sorting a list with non-integer elements and a list with duplicate elements.

Edge Cases:

1. **Empty List**: The function should return an empty list when the input is an empty list.

2. **Single Element List**: The function should return the same single-element list as output.

3. **All Elements are the Same**: The function should return the same list as output.

4. **List with Duplicate Elements**: The function should correctly sort the list.

Performance Test Cases:

1. **Large List**: The function should be able to sort a list with a large number of elements in a reasonable amount of time.

2. **List with Large Numbers**: The function should be able to sort a list with large integer elements.

3. **List with Small Numbers**: The function should be able to sort a list with small integer elements.

Error Handling Cases:

1. **Non-Integer Elements**: The function should raise a TypeError when the input list contains non-integer elements.

2. **Null Input**: The function should raise a TypeError when the input is null.

3. **Non-List Input**: The function should raise a TypeError when the input is not a list.

These categories of tests should provide a comprehensive validation of the merge sort function implementation.

## Test Strategy
Test Strategy:

Test Cases Categories:
1. Positive Test Cases: These will include scenarios where we provide valid inputs to the function and expect a successful sorting of the array. For example, providing an array of unsorted integers and expecting a sorted array as output.
2. Negative Test Cases: These include scenarios where we provide invalid inputs to test the robustness of the function. For example, providing an empty array or an array with non-integer values.

Edge Cases:
Edge cases will include scenarios where we provide inputs at the extreme ends of what the function is expected to handle. For this function, edge cases can include:
1. An array that is already sorted.
2. An array sorted in descending order.
3. An array with duplicate values.
4. An array with just one value.
5. An array with two values, where one is bigger than the other and vice versa.

Performance Test Cases:
Performance test cases are created to test the efficiency and speed of the function under different conditions. For this function, performance test cases can include:
1. Providing a large size of array and checking how long the function takes to sort the array.
2. Providing a small size of array and comparing the time taken to sort with the time taken for a large array.

Error Handling Cases:
Error handling cases are created to test how the function handles different error scenarios. For this function, error handling cases can include:
1. Providing a None value as input and checking if the function throws an appropriate error.
2. Providing different data types like string, float instead of integer in the array and checking how the function handles them. 
3. Providing an array with mixed data types and checking if the function throws an appropriate error. 

The merge_sort function is a recursive function, so it's important to test it under different scenarios to ensure it handles all possible inputs and doesn't cause a stack overflow.

## Test Strategy
Test Strategy:

Test Cases Categories:
1. Positive Test Cases: These test cases include scenarios where the expected outcome is known and is supposed to be correct. For example, providing an array of integers in random order and expecting them to be sorted in ascending order.

2. Negative Test Cases: These test cases include scenarios where the program should fail. For example, providing a non-integer or non-array input should result in a type error.

Edge Cases:
1. Empty Array: Check how the function behaves when an empty array is given as input. The expected outcome in this case should be an empty array.

2. Single Element Array: The function should return a single element array as it is.

3. Large Numbers: Test with very large numbers to check for any overflow issues.

4. Duplicates: Test with duplicate numbers in the array. The function should still sort and return all elements including duplicates.

Performance Test Cases:
1. Large Array: Test the function with a large size array. This is to check if the function can handle a large amount of data and to measure its time complexity.

2. Sorted Array: Test the function with an already sorted array. This will test the best case scenario for the merge sort algorithm.

3. Reverse Sorted Array: Test the function with a reverse sorted array. This will test the worst case scenario for the merge sort algorithm.

Error Handling Cases:
1. Non-Array Input: The function should raise a type error when the input is not an array.

2. Non-Integer Elements: The function should raise a type error when the array contains non-integer elements.

3. Null Input: The function should handle null input appropriately, possibly by throwing an appropriate exception.
