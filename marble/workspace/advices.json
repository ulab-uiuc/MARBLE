    "task_description": "Software Development Task:\n\nPlease write a game called 'Team_Tactics' that is a multiplayer action game designed to test the collaborative capabilities of multiple AI agents. Team_Tactics is a game where AI agents work together to complete objectives, such as capturing flags, defending bases, and eliminating enemy agents. The game is set in various dynamic environments, and agents must communicate and coordinate their actions to succeed.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - Implement a game environment with multiple levels, each featuring different objectives (e.g., capture the flag, defend the base, eliminate enemies).\n   - Design AI agents with different roles (e.g., attacker, defender, scout) and abilities (e.g., increased speed, healing, shielding).\n   - Develop a communication system that allows AI agents to share information, such as enemy locations, objective status, and strategic plans.\n   - Create a scoring system that rewards successful completion of objectives and penalizes failures or inefficient play.\n   - Provide comprehensive test cases to validate the functionality of the game and the collaborative capabilities of the AI agents, including input scenarios, expected outputs, and edge cases.\n   - Test scenarios should include: agents successfully capturing the flag, defending the base from multiple attackers, and coordinating to eliminate all enemies in a level.\n   - Edge cases should cover: agents failing to communicate effectively, agents getting stuck or unable to navigate the environment, and unexpected interactions between different agent abilities.\n\n\n2. Project structure:\n   - solution.py (main implementation)\n\n3. Development process:\n   - Developer: Create the code.\n   - Developer: Update the code.\n   - Reviewer: Code review\n\nIf there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:\n```python\n# file_name_1.py\n# your code here\n\n# file_name_2.py\n# your code here\n\n# file_name_3.py\n# your code here\n```\n\nPlease work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.",
