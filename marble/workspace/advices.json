Implementation requirements:\n   - The game should be a simple 2D ping pong game with a ball and a paddle.\n   - The paddle should be controlled by the player using the keyboard.\n   - The ball should move towards the paddle and bounce off the walls.\n   - The game should be terminal based.\n   - The game should be playable by pressing the arrow keys.",

    "suggestions": "1. **Separation of Concerns**:\n   - Consider separating the game logic into different functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, functions for handling player input, updating game state, and rendering the game screen.\n   - Create a function to handle player input to make the main loop cleaner and more focused on game logic.\n\n2. **Magic Numbers**:\n   - Replace magic numbers like `2`, `1`, `3`, `WIDTH - 2`, `WIDTH - 3` with named constants to improve code readability and maintainability.\n   - Define constants for paddle movement speed, ball speed, and other relevant values to make the code more flexible.\n\n3. **Variable Naming**:\n   - Use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability. For example, instead of `dx` and `dy`, consider using `ball_speed_x` and `ball_speed_y`.\n\n4. **AI Movement**:\n   - The current AI movement logic is very basic. Consider implementing a more sophisticated AI algorithm to make the game more challenging. For example, an AI that predicts the ball's trajectory and moves accordingly.\n\n5. **Game Over Condition**:\n   - Implement a game over condition when the ball goes beyond the player's paddle or AI's paddle. Add scoring mechanism to track the player's performance.\n\n6. **Input Handling**:\n   - Instead of using the `keyboard` library, consider using the built-in `input()` function to handle player input. This will make the game more portable and easier to run on different systems.\n\n7. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Instead of clearing the entire screen every frame, consider only updating the portions of the screen that have changed. This can improve performance, especially in larger games.\n\n8. **Error Handling**:\n   - Add error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected input or edge cases that may cause the game to crash.\n\n9. **Documentation**:\n   - Add docstrings to functions to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. This will make the code more understandable for other developers and for future reference.\n\n10. **Code Structure**:\n    - Consider organizing the code into classes to encapsulate related functionality. For example, create classes for the game, ball, paddle, and AI opponent.\n\nBy addressing these suggestions, the code will be more structured, maintainable, and extensible, resulting in a better overall ping pong game implementation."

    "suggestions": "1. **Code Structure:**\n   - Consider breaking down the code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, functions for updating ball position, drawing the game, handling player input, etc.\n   - Create a class to encapsulate the game logic and variables. This will help in organizing the code better and make it more object-oriented.\n\n2. **Magic Numbers:**\n   - Replace magic numbers like `2`, `3`, `WIDTH - 2`, `WIDTH - 3`, etc., with named constants for better readability and maintainability.\n   - Define constants for paddle movement speed, ball speed, etc., to make the code more flexible.\n\n3. **Input Handling:**\n   - Instead of using the `keyboard` library, consider using the built-in `input()` function to handle player input.

Consider implementing a more sophisticated AI that can predict the ball's trajectory and move accordingly.\n   - Add randomness to the AI movement to make it less predictable and more challenging for the player.\n\n5. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - Instead of clearing the entire screen every frame, consider only updating the necessary parts of the screen to improve performance.\n   - Use a more efficient collision detection algorithm to handle ball-wall and ball-paddle collisions.\n\n6. **Boundary Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that the ball does not go out of bounds vertically to prevent unexpected behavior.\n   - Adjust the paddle movement logic to prevent paddles from going out of bounds.\n\n7. **Documentation:**\n   - Add docstrings to functions to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. This will make the code more understandable for other developers.\n\n8. **Error Handling:**\n   - Implement error handling for edge cases such as invalid input or unexpected behavior to prevent the game from crashing.\n\n9. **Game Over Condition:**\n   - Implement a game over condition when the ball goes past the player's paddle or the AI's paddle. Display a message and allow the player to restart the game.\n\n10. **Consistent Naming:**\n    - Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the code. For example, use either snake_case or camelCase for variable and function names.\n\nBy addressing these suggestions, the code will be more structured, maintainable, and provide a better gaming experience for the players."
