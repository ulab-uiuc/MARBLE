    "suggestions": "The code provided meets most of the requirements specified in the task description. However, there are a few areas that need improvement:\n\n1. **Block Movement**: The code does not handle the block movement correctly. When the block is moved down and a collision is detected, the block is moved up, but this can cause the block to overlap with other blocks in the grid. You should implement a more robust collision detection and response system.\n\nActionable Suggestion: You should implement a more robust collision detection and response system to handle block movement correctly.\n\n2. **Block Rotation**: The code does not handle block rotation correctly. When the block is rotated and a collision is detected, the block is rotated back to its original position, but this can cause the block to overlap with other blocks in the grid. You should implement a more robust collision detection and response system.\n\nActionable Suggestion: You should implement a more robust collision detection and response system to handle block rotation correctly.\n\n3. **Game Over Condition**: The code does not have a game over condition. The game continues to run even when the grid is completely filled with blocks. You should implement a game over condition to stop the game when the grid is completely filled.\n\nActionable Suggestion: You should implement a game over condition to stop the game when the grid is completely filled.\n\n4. **Score Display**: The code displays the score at the top left corner of the screen, but it does not update the score in real-time. You should update the score display in real-time to reflect the current score.\n\nActionable Suggestion: You should update the score display in real-time to reflect the current score.\n\n5. **Block Color**: The code uses a fixed color for all blocks, but it would be more visually appealing to use different colors for different blocks. You should implement a system to randomly select a color for each block.\n\nActionable Suggestion: You should implement a system to randomly select a color for each block.\n\nHere is an updated version of the code that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport pygame\nimport sys\n\n# Initialize Pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Define some colors\nBLACK = (0, 0, 0)\nWHITE = (255, 255, 255)\nGRAY = (128, 128, 128)\n\n# Set the width and height of each block\nBLOCK_SIZE = 30\n\n# Set the width and height of the grid\nGRID_WIDTH = 10\nGRID_HEIGHT = 20\n\n# Set the margin between the grid and the border\nMARGIN = 20\n\n# Set the size of the screen\nSCREEN_WIDTH = GRID_WIDTH * BLOCK_SIZE + 2 * MARGIN\nSCREEN_HEIGHT = GRID_HEIGHT * BLOCK_SIZE + 2 * MARGIN\n\n# Create the screen\nSCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))\n\n# Set the font for the score\nFONT = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)\n\n# Define the shapes of the blocks\nSHAPES = [\n    [[1, 1, 1, 1]],  #

    "suggestions": "The code provided meets most of the requirements specified in the task description. However, there are a few areas that need improvement:\n\n1. **Block Movement Up**: The task description requires the player to be able to move blocks up, but the code does not implement this feature. You should add a method to the Block class to move the block up and handle the corresponding key press event in the main loop.\n\n2. **Block Rotation**: The code implements block rotation, but it does not handle the case where the rotated block would go out of the grid boundaries. You should modify the rotate method in the Block class to check for collisions after rotation and move the block back to its previous position if a collision is detected.\n\n3. **Line Clearing**: The code clears lines when they are completely filled, but it does not update the grid correctly after clearing lines. You should modify the clear_lines method in the Game class to correctly update the grid after clearing lines.\n\n4. **Score Calculation**: The task description requires the player's score to be tracked and displayed, but the code does not specify how the score is calculated. You should modify the clear_lines method in the Game class to calculate the score based on the number of lines cleared.\n\n5. **Game Over Condition**: The code checks for a game over condition, but it does not handle the case where the game is over due to a block reaching the top of the grid. You should modify the check_game_over method in the Game class to handle this case correctly.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The code does not include error handling to prevent the game from crashing if an unexpected event occurs.

    "suggestions": "The code provided meets most of the requirements specified in the task description. However, there are a few areas that need improvement:\n\n1. **Block Rotation**: The code currently rotates the block by 90 degrees clockwise. However, it does not handle the case where the block cannot be rotated due to collision with the grid or other blocks. You should add a check to prevent the block from rotating if it would cause a collision.\n\n2. **Block Movement**: The code currently moves the block down automatically. However, it does not provide an option for the player to move the block down faster. You should add a feature to allow the player to move the block down faster by pressing the down arrow key.\n\n3. **Line Clearing**: The code currently clears lines when they are completely filled. However, it does not provide any visual feedback to the player when a line is cleared. You should add a feature to display a message or animation when a line is cleared.\n\n4. **Score Display**: The code currently displays the player's score. However, it does not provide any information about the number of lines cleared. You should add a feature to display the number of lines cleared along with the score.\n\n5. **Game Over Condition**: The code currently checks for a game over condition by checking if any blocks have reached the top of the grid. However, it does not provide any visual feedback to the player when the game is over. You should add a feature to display a message or animation when the game is over.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The code currently does not handle any errors that may occur during gameplay. You should add try-except blocks to handle any potential errors and provide a meaningful error message to the player.\n\n7. **Code Comments**: The code currently does not have any comments to explain the purpose of each function or method. You should add comments to explain the purpose of each function or method to improve code readability.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement some of these suggestions:\n\n```python\n# Block Rotation\ndef rotate(self):\n    self.shape = [list(reversed(i)) for i in zip(*self.shape)]\n    if self.check_collision():\n        self.shape = [list(reversed(i)) for i in zip(*self.shape)]\n        self.shape = [list(reversed(i)) for i in zip(*self.shape)]\n        self.shape = [list(reversed(i)) for i in zip(*self.shape)]\n\n# Block Movement\ndef move_down(self):\n    self.y += 1\n    if self.check_collision():\n        self.y -= 1\n\ndef move_down_faster(self):\n    while not self.check_collision():\n        self.y += 1\n\n# Line Clearing\ndef clear_lines(self):\n    lines_cleared = 0\n    for y in range(GRID_HEIGHT):\n        if all(self.grid[y]):\n            del self.grid[y]\n            self.grid.insert(0, [0 for _ in range(GRID_WIDTH)])\n            lines_cleared += 1\n            print(f\"Line cleared!
