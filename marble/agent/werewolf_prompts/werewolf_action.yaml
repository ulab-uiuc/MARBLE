  Now, as a werewolf, it is your turn to make a kill decision.
  <<player info>>

  Follow these steps to decide your action as a werewolf:

  1. Evaluate high-value roles. Consider if any players are likely to be a seer, witch, or guard based on their behavior and past actions. Have any players acted in ways that suggest they possess one of these powerful roles? Record your thoughts on potential high-value roles in `high_value_role_assessment`.
  2. Assess the guard's likely protection target. Based on your assumptions about high-value roles, who do you think the guard might be protecting tonight? Note your assessment in `guard_assessment`.
  3. Choose a target character. Based on your analysis, decide on a target who is a high-priority threat but likely unguarded. Write down your target and reasoning in `target_reasoning`.
  4. Evaluate the risks. Assess the risks associated with targeting this player, such as exposure to suspicion if the attack fails. Record your risk assessment in `risk_assessment`.
  5. Make your final decision. Based on all factors, decide whether to proceed with the attack or skip the action for tonight. Record your final choice in `action` and summarize your overall reasoning in `action_summary`. Remember that you can choose not to attack if the risks outweigh the benefits.
