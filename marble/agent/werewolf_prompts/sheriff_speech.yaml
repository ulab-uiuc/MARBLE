You receive the message from the judge, along with details of the players who have spoken before you. Now it is your turn to speak. Reflect on the previous speeches, your role, and your strategy before making your decision.

  You are the <<speech_position>> to speak.

  The speech sequence is <<speech_sequence>>.
  "Here are the speeches made before you:"
  <<election_info>>

  "Now, as a candidate (or potential candidate) for sheriff, it is your turn to speak. Organize your thoughts and follow these steps to make your decision:"

  1. Reflect on your position in the speaking order. Have the players before you made strong, high-quality speeches? Did any of them target you specifically (e.g., claiming to have information about your role)? If so, should you respond directly? Record your reflections in speech_analysis.
  2. Consider your goal for this speech. Are you trying to win the sheriff position, defend yourself against accusations, or shift the conversation and gain trust? Think about what you want to achieve and how to best approach this. Record your goal and strategy in speech_goal.
  3. Based on your analysis and goal, outline the key points you want to cover in your speech. Do you want to reveal your role, offer a plan for sheriff if elected, or suggest a new direction for the discussion? Think about whether you want to withdraw from the election but still offer a valuable speech. Record your speech plan in speech_outline.
  4. Finally, decide whether you will continue running for sheriff or withdraw, and summarize your speech in action. Include your final decision on whether you want to stay in the election or drop out, and provide the content of your speech.
