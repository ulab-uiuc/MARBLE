  You are evaluating the communication performance of villagers in a Werewolf game. Your task is to analyze their performance across five key aspects: information effectiveness, collaboration, logic and reasoning, leadership and guidance, and result orientation.
  Use the detailed scoring criteria provided to score each aspect on a scale of 0-5. Record both reasoning and scores for each aspect. The overall score will be calculated as the average of these scores.

  Here are the detailed scoring criteria for each aspect:

  **Information Effectiveness**
  - **5**: Information was consistently clear, complete, and relevant. Key points were shared promptly, and discussions integrated critical data effectively.
  - **4**: Most information was effectively conveyed, with minor gaps or delays. These had limited impact on decision-making.
  - **3**: Information sharing was inconsistent, with some delays or omissions. Discussions relied more on reactions than proactive integration of data.
  - **2**: Key information was often missed or not conveyed clearly. This negatively impacted the village's ability to strategize effectively.
  - **1**: Communication was severely lacking or misleading, leading to confusion and disrupted strategies.
  - **0**: No meaningful information was shared, and discussions failed to contribute to strategic decisions.

  **Collaboration**
  - **5**: The villagers demonstrated excellent collaboration, consistently aligning on voting and strategy with clear teamwork.
  - **4**: Collaboration was strong overall, with occasional misalignments that had limited impact on outcomes.
  - **3**: Some degree of collaboration was present, but frequent misalignments or conflicts hindered effectiveness.
  - **2**: Collaboration was weak, with significant disagreements or disorganization impacting strategy.
  - **1**: Little to no collaboration was evident, with players acting independently to the detriment of the village.
  - **0**: Complete lack of collaboration, with villagers entirely disorganized and working against each other.

  **Logic and Reasoning**
  - **5**: Logical analysis was excellent, consistently leading to accurate deductions and effective strategies.
  - **4**: Reasoning was mostly sound, with minor errors or oversights that had limited impact.
  - **3**: Reasoning showed some merit but included notable mistakes or lapses in logic that hindered effectiveness.
  - **2**: Logical analysis was weak, with frequent errors or reliance on intuition over evidence.
  - **1**: Logic was severely lacking, with decisions driven primarily by emotion or random guesses.
  - **0**: No logical reasoning was evident, with actions entirely arbitrary or self-defeating.

  **Leadership and Guidance**
  - **5**: Leadership was strong and consistent, providing clear direction and rallying villagers effectively.
  - **4**: Leadership was mostly effective, with occasional lapses in guidance or authority.
  - **3**: Leadership was present but inconsistent, with limited impact on overall strategy.
  - **2**: Leadership was weak, with little direction or influence on the village's decisions.
  - **1**: No meaningful leadership was evident, leaving the village disorganized.
  - **0**: Leadership was actively harmful, misleading villagers and disrupting strategy.

  **Result Orientation**
  - **5**: The villagers achieved a decisive victory with strong communication and strategy throughout.
  - **4**: The villagers succeeded but with some mistakes or inefficiencies that slightly delayed the outcome.
  - **3**: The villagers showed progress toward their goals but failed to secure victory due to notable errors or disorganization.
  - **2**: The villagers made limited progress, with poor communication and strategy contributing to their defeat.
  - **1**: The villagers failed almost entirely, with communication breakdowns leading to rapid loss.
  - **0**: The villagers were utterly ineffective, showing no progress toward their goals and losing decisively.
