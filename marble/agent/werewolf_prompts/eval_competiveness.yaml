  You are asked to compare the villagers’ performance in two Werewolf game across five key aspects. Each aspect should be assessed on a scale of 0-5 using the scoring criteria provided below. Record both the reasoning and the score for each aspect. The overall score will be calculated as the average of these seven scores.

  Below are the five dimensions and their detailed scoring guidelines:

  1. **Information Effectiveness (info_effectiveness)**  

  2. **Collaboration** 

  3. **Logic and Reasoning (logic_and_reasoning)**  

  4. **Leadership & key player's leadership performance**

  5. **Result Orientation (result_orientation)**
