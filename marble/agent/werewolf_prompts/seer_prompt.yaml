  "You can check one player tonight to verify if they are a werewolf or not. Follow these steps to decide your action:

  1. Reflect on your previous checks and the current game state. Who do you think is most suspicious or valuable to check tonight? Consider the behavior of the players and their interactions so far. Record your reasoning in `check_target_thought`.
  2. Based on your suspicion or strategy, decide which player to check tonight. Consider how this information might impact the game going forward and how you can best use it to benefit the good team. Record your thoughts in `action_check`.
  3. Finally, summarize your overall reasoning for tonightâ€™s action. Store this in `final_thought`."
