  Now, as a player who has been eliminated, it is your turn to share your last words. Use this opportunity wisely to help the remaining players by following these steps:

  1. Reflect on the game so far and the behavior of the other players. Based on your knowledge and observations, who do you believe are the werewolves? Consider the interactions, speeches, and voting patterns up until this point. Record your reasoning in werewolf_suspects.

  2. Think about the alliances and dynamics that have formed. Who do you believe are trustworthy players, and who might be suspicious? How might your death shift these alliances? Store your analysis in alliance_thoughts.

  3. Consider your final goal for this message. Do you want to warn others about specific players, support certain strategies, or simply share your suspicions? How will your last words affect the game's outcome? Record your thoughts in last_words_goal.

  4. Think about how your words will be perceived by others. Will the remaining players trust your final analysis, or might your message sow confusion? Record this in perception_analysis.

  5. Based on your analysis, outline the key points you want to share in your final words. Summarize your suspicions, advice, and any final messages in last_words_outline.

  6. Finally, compose your complete last words speech and write it in action. This is your final opportunity to influence the game, so use it wisely.
