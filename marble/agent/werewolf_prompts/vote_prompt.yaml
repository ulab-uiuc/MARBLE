  Now, it is your turn to vote for which player to banish. 
  
  1. Consider the current situation and your understanding of each player's role. Based on the previous discussions, who do you believe are the werewolves? Record your thoughts and reasoning in werewolf_suspects.

  2. Think about how other players perceive the situation. In their view, who is most likely to be a werewolf? How might their perspectives influence their votes? Store your analysis in public_perception.

  3. Now, focus on your goal. What do you need to achieve in order to win? If you are a werewolf, you should aim to deflect suspicion from yourself. If you are a villager or another role, you should aim to identify the true werewolves. Record your thoughts in role_strategy.

  4. Based on the current dynamics, who do you think has the lowest standing or trust in the game? Is there a player whose banishment could shift the game in your favor? Record this in target_analysis.

  5. Consider how your vote will be perceived by others. Will voting for a particular player make you seem more trustworthy or raise suspicion? Will it help or hurt your chances of winning? Record your thoughts in perception_analysis.

  6. Finally, make your decision. Will you vote to banish a specific player, or will you choose to abstain? Record your final decision in action and summarize your reasoning in final_thought.
