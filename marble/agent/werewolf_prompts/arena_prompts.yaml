          Communication log for agents A: <<communication log A>>

          Communication log for agents B: <<communication log B>>

          Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of communications within the multi agents system based on the provided context. In agent system A and system B, you should decide which one is better than the other. Consider the following aspects in your evaluation:

          1.Effective Information Transmission: Were valuable and relevant information successfully exchanged between agents?\n

          2.Clarity of Expression: Did agents communicate their intentions and information clearly and unambiguously?

          3.Assistance in Task Resolution: Did the communication facilitate the successful completion or progression of the task?

          4.Efficiency of Information Exchange: Was information exchanged in a manner that maximized understanding with minimal rounds?

          5.Necessity of Communication: Was the communication necessary and pertinent to the agents' collaboration and task execution?

          You should consider all 5 aspects and decide which one is the winner. You should give a winner in each aspects. The system win 3 times is the final winner.


          Format the judgement as follows: \"Winner: [[[ABAAB]]]\". Each letter means the winner of the corresponding aspect of the index.
          For example, if you believe A won in aspect 1,3,4 and B won 2,5., you would enter: \"Winner: [[[ABAAB]]]\".

          Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the the effectiveness of self-coordination within the multi agents system based on the provided context. Focus on whether agents autonomously organized their tasks and maintained clarity of roles without centralized oversight. In agent system A and system B, you should decide which one is better than the other. Consider the following aspects in your evaluation:
          1. Whether agents can claerly understanding their roles and responsibilities.
          2. Whether their self-coordination is effective enough.
          3. Whether agents have excellent logical analysis, consistently leading to accurate deductions and effective strategies.
          You should consider all 5 aspects and decide which one is the winner. You should give a winner in each aspects. The system win 3 times is the final winner.

          Format the judgement as follows: \"Winner: [[[ABA]]]\". Each letter means the winner of the corresponding aspect of the index.
          For example, if you believe A won in aspect 1,3 and B won 2, you would enter: \"Winner: [[[ABA]]]\".
