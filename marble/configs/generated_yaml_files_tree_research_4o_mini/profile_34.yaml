  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION  \nSince early months\
    \ of  2020, coronavirus disease (COVID -19), which is considerably contagious\
    \ has \npermeated through the globe  [1, 2] . It has imposed significant and unprecedented\
    \  sufferings and threats for \npremature death  [2]. Unequivocally , it is now\
    \ regarded as  the most deadly and dangerous disease that ma kes \nsevere panic\
    \ to the crowd [3].  The well-known reason for death  of this pandemic  is obstacles\
    \ in oxygen intake \ndue to inflammation lung, filled air sacs with discharge\
    \ and fluid  [3]. Early  identification of the  COVID can  not \nonly reduce \
    \ death  rate sharply, but also most prone  to faster recovery  phase  [1]. \n\
    For the first time in the December of 2019, the sick persons  infected with COVID\
    \ -19 were identified in Wuhan, \nChina  [4]. Often, the patients develop a dry\
    \ cough, fever, shortness of breath, weariness , sore throat, pains, runny \n\
    nose, body aches, and diarrhoea symptoms.  High fever and dry cough are its core\
    \ symptoms  [3]. Its symptoms \nare similar to pneumonia and influenza- A that\
    \ affect the human respiratory tract and lungs  [1, 5] . Since the \nseparation\
    \ of infection between COVID -19 and bacterial pneumonia is not an easy task,\
    \ the automatic feature \nextraction from images can help to diagnose the disease\
    \ [6]. The di fference is that lung lesions in COVID -19 \npatients are higher\
    \ than pneumonia and influenza diseases [7]. In fact, COVID- 19 damages the lungs\
    \ intensely.  \nThe virus causes the demise of most persons  who have chronic\
    \ diseases  (for instance, diabetes) [8].   \nThe viability of this virus in the\
    \ air is  expected to be for almost three hours  [3]. It can travel through the\
    \ \npatient's cough or sneeze droplets fro m person to person in close contact.\
    \ It can even contaminate humans with \neating food in infected copper, plastic,\
    \ and stainless steel dishes . It should be mentioned out  the COVID\u2010 19\
    \ can \nbe live in aforementioned utensils  for several hours  [3]. \nSeveral\
    \ diagnostic tasks  such as  viral throat swab testing , blood, and serologic\
    \ tests are conducted for this \ndisease . Also, Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase\
    \ Chain Reaction (RT -PCR) is a yardstick from Nasopharyngeal \nSwabs (NS) and\
    \ Or -pharyngeal Swabs (OS) samples. Nevertheless, these recognition measures\
    \ do  not only require \nmanual intervention but also are time -consuming process\
    \ es [2, 9] . Therefore, using  the X-ray or Computed \nTomography (CT) data \
    \ is more preferable [10, 11] . These scanning images conspicuously indicate COVID\
    \ -19 \nviral infections  with higher confidence . Although, t hese medical  imaging\
    \ modalities are available and \n                                            \
