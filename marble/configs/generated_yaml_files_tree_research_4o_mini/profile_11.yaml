  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to harnessing the power of machine learning
    and large language models (LLMs) to enhance educational assessment and learning
    outcomes. My work primarily focuses on developing scalable and effective methods
    for evaluating student performance, particularly in low-resource settings. I have
    explored innovative approaches, such as using non-expert crowdworkers and comparative
    judgment to assess complex student responses, demonstrating significant improvements
    in inter-rater reliability.


    My research also delves into the integration of LLMs within Intelligent Tutoring
    Systems (ITSs), where I have evaluated their safety and effectiveness through
    extensive empirical studies. For instance, I found that GPT-4 can grade open-ended
    responses with near-human accuracy, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool
    for formative assessments in K-12 education.


    Additionally, I have investigated the use of large-scale speech models to automate
    the evaluation of oral reading fluency, achieving promising results that align
    closely with expert human graders. My recent work with the AMMORE dataset further
    highlights the capabilities of LLMs in grading challenging student answers, revealing
    how even modest improvements in grading accuracy can significantly impact the
    assessment of student mastery.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and
    practical educational applications, ultimately striving to improve learning experiences
    for students across diverse contexts.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed
    Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes
    within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction
    and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, thereby enhancing their scalability
    and effectiveness.


    In addition to architectural advancements, I have investigated the interplay between
    neural network structures and their predictive performance through relational
    graphs. My work aims to systematically study the design space of GNNs, providing
    guidelines for optimizing architectures across different tasks. I am also passionate
    about making AutoML more efficient, as demonstrated by my development of AutoTransfer,
    which leverages prior architectural knowledge to streamline the search for optimal
    models.


    Overall, my research is driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what GNNs
    can achieve, making them more adaptable, interpretable, and effective in real-world
    applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to the exploration of Generalized Parton Distributions
    (GPDs) and their implications in hadron physics. My recent work focuses on extending
    GPDs to the full kinematic domain through a novel procedure that addresses both
    polynomiality and positivity, which are crucial for the consistency of these distributions.
    By applying this method to models of Light-front wave-functions, particularly

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \nIntroduction\n\nImprovements in Science,\
    \ Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education have accelerated the\
    \ shift from teaching and assessing facts to developing students\u2019 conceptual\
    \ understanding and problem-solving skills (NGSS 2013). To foster students\u2019\
    \ developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments\
    \ that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\_al. 2023). Formative assessments\
    \ play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance\
    \ when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation\
    \ skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and\
    \ generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming\
    \ for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek\
    \ et\_al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for\
    \ automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\_al. 2023) and providing feedback\
    \ to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\_al. 2023). These approaches\
    \ can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating\
    \ actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there\
    \ is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading\
    \ and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning,\
    \ and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena\
    \ (Mao et\_al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop\
    \ LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning\
    \ with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative\
    \ assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach,\
    \ discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose\
    \ future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n\
    \ \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science,\
    \ teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\_\
    al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced\
    \ learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction\
    \ and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments,\
    \ knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are\
    \ difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative\
    \ assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning\
    \ goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students\
    \ recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers\
    \ with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support\
    \ their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative\
    \ assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses\
    \ may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic\
    \ expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete\
    \ feedback (Liu et\_al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent\
    \ intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research\
    \ has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful\
    \ formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning\
    \ goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved\
    \ automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g.,\
    \ Adair et\_al. 2023; Wilson et\_al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data\
    \ augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu\
    \ et\_al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\_al. 2023), cross-prompt\
    \ fine-tuning (Funayama et\_al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling\
    \ responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
