  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of optimization, machine
    learning, and robotics. My recent work focuses on developing efficient algorithms
    for training deep neural networks, particularly through innovative Levenberg-Marquardt
    variants that leverage subsampled Gauss-Newton and natural gradient methods. I
    have explored the learning dynamics of large language models, providing insights
    into how training examples influence model predictions, which has led to improved
    alignment performance in these systems.


    In robotics, I have investigated cooperative task allocation for networked mobile
    manipulators, proposing adaptive control strategies that ensure motion synchronization
    despite uncertainties. My work also extends to the realm of network function virtualization,
    where I developed a dynamic auto-scaling algorithm that balances performance and
    operational costs for 5G networks.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the understanding of unbiased learning-to-rank
    algorithms, addressing challenges in handling biased feedback in recommender systems.
    My research emphasizes the importance of integrating marketing and manufacturing
    knowledge in product design, as well as tackling popularity bias in sequential
    recommendation systems through structural causal models.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    ensuring that the algorithms and models I develop are not only innovative but
    also applicable to real-world challenges across various domains.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher with a strong focus on graph theory, algorithm design,
    and machine learning, particularly in the context of optimizing computational
    efficiency and understanding complex structures. My recent work has significantly
    advanced the field of Gomory-Hu trees, where I improved the running time for computing
    these succinct representations of pairwise minimum cuts to a groundbreaking quadratic
    time complexity. I have also contributed to the development of cut-equivalent
    trees, enhancing existing algorithms to achieve faster runtimes.


    In addition to my work on graph structures, I have explored dynamic algorithms,
    particularly in maintaining maximal independent sets in evolving graphs, where
    I introduced a randomized algorithm with a remarkably efficient update time. My
    research extends to distance sensitivity oracles, where I developed a new structure
    that optimizes space and query efficiency.


    I am also deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and graph
    theory, as evidenced by my studies on biases in large pretrained language models
    and the development of tools to quantify and mitigate these biases. My work on
    Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA) addresses challenges in code generation by large
    language models, demonstrating significant improvements in performance.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    providing efficient algorithms and tools that can be utilized across various domains,
    from computational graph theory to machine learning.'
