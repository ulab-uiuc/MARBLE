  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing societal issues through
    advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of hate speech
    detection, wildlife trafficking, and human activity recognition. My recent work
    focuses on developing robust frameworks that not only enhance detection accuracy
    but also ensure fairness and resilience against adversarial attacks. For instance,
    I designed a novel hate speech detection framework that leverages Bidirectional
    Quaternion-Quasi-LSTM layers, achieving remarkable performance across multiple
    datasets while addressing model uncertainty and bias.


    In addition to hate speech detection, I have tackled the challenge of identifying
    wildlife trafficking behaviors in online platforms. By creating a scalable dataset
    and employing a human-in-the-loop approach, I developed a practical framework
    that effectively identifies suspicious posts, contributing to the fight against
    illegal wildlife trade.


    My research also delves into the complexities of human activity recognition, where
    I introduced the Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning framework.
    This innovative approach captures the nuances of context-aware data, significantly
    outperforming existing models.


    I am passionate about making my work accessible to the research community, sharing
    code and datasets to foster collaboration and further exploration. My goal is
    to leverage machine learning to create impactful solutions that address real-world
    challenges, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing challenges in the realms
    of misinformation, communication networks, and machine learning. My recent work
    has focused on combating the spread of fake news, particularly during the COVID-19
    pandemic, where I developed the MM-COVID dataset to facilitate multilingual fake
    news detection. This dataset, comprising over 10,000 pieces of content in multiple
    languages, serves as a vital resource for understanding and mitigating the impact
    of misinformation.


    In addition to my work on fake news, I have explored the potential of advanced
    text generation methods, creating FactGen to generate high-quality news content
    while ensuring consistency and factual accuracy. My research also extends to the
    telecommunications sector, where I have critically evaluated analogue radio over
    fiber (A-RoF) techniques for next-generation radio access networks, proposing
    innovative architectures to enhance connectivity for high-speed trains.


    I am particularly interested in the intersection of self-supervised learning and
    graph neural networks, exemplified by my development of GRENADE, a model that
    effectively captures both textual semantics and structural context in text-attributed
    graphs. Furthermore, I have contributed to federated learning protocols, introducing
    FedADMM to improve communication efficiency and adaptability in heterogeneous
    environments.


    My work is driven by a commitment to advancing technology for societal benefit,

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION  \nAn increase in training\
    \ data does not necessarily  result in a solution for the learning problem. Nevertheless,\
    \ the quantity \nof data remains decisive for the quality of a supervised classifier.\
    \ Originating from the field of computer vision, many \ndifferent conclusion for\
    \ this survey.  3 2 BACKGROUND: FOUNDATIONS, GOALS, AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA AUGMENTATION\
    \  \nIn many machine learning scenarios, not enough data is available to train\
    \ a high -quality classifier. To a ddress this \nproblem, data augmentation can\
    \ be used. It artificially enlarges the amount of available training data by means\
    \ of \ntransformations [7]. In the well-known LeNet by LeCun et al. [8], early\
    \ versions of data augmentation have already been \nobserved . The notion of data\
    \ augmentation comprises various research in different sub -areas of machine learning.\
    \ Many \nscientific works merely relate data augmentation to deep learning, yet\
    \ it is frequently applied in the entire context of \nmachine learning. Therefore,\
    \ this paper a dopts the notion of data augmentation as a broad concept, encompassing\
    \ any \nmethod that enables the transformation of training data. However, following\
    \ common understanding in research, semi -\nsupervised learning is not regarded\
    \ as a form of data augmentation  and is only thematized if sensible in this survey.\
    \  \nAn important term relating to  data augmentation is label preservation, which\
    \ describes transformations of training \ndata that preserve class information\
    \ [9]. For exa mple, i n sentiment analysis, an entity replacement within a sentence\
    \ is \noften sufficient for label preservation , but randomly adding  words may\
    \ alter the sentiment (e.g., an additional \u201Cnot\u201D \ncould invert the\
    \ meaning of a sentence). In many research works, l abel preservation is adapted\
    \ to also cover \ntransformations changing the class information , if the label\
    \ is adjusted correctly. Additionally, many transformations do \nnot maintain\
    \ the correct  class  in every case , but with a high probability. Shorten and\
    \ Khoshgoftaar [5] define this \nprobability as the safety of a data augmentation\
    \ method. When this uncertainty is known, it could be directly integrated \nin\
    \ the label. Otherwise, conclusions. T he benchmark should not be too large, in\
    \ order to ensure specific evaluations can \nstill be carried out . Researchers\
    \ that try to develop such a benchmark, could also consider to specify how much\
    \ data \naugmentation should be performed  and what models should be used.  When\
    \ determining which model should be used , it \nmight be useful to create an updatable\
    \ benchmark, as proposed by Gehrmann et al [157] , which can be modified \naccording\
    \ to more recent state -of-the-art models.  \n4.4 Enhancing the Understanding\
    \  of Text  Data Augmentation   \nShorten and  Khoshgoftaar  [5] highlight that\
    \  while  for some image data augmentation techniques it is easy to understand\
    \ \nhow they might improve the dataset and derived classifiers , however , for\
    \ other techniques  this improvement has not \nbeen  explainable  yet. This also\
    \ applies to the text regime, where for example, data augmentation results in\
    \ a continuity \nproblem of learning, so that, e.g., the encoder\n\n         \
