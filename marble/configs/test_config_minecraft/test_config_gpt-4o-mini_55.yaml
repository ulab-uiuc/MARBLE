  content: "This is in the game of Minecraft. Build a building according to a blueprint.\
    \ The blueprint contains necessary information about the material, facing direction\
    \ and position of each block.\n*** The minecraft knowledge card ***\nHere are\
    \ some knowledge about minecraft:\n1. The minecraft world x,z is the horizontal\
    \ coordinate, y is the vertical coordinate. y=-61 is the ground level.\n2. You\
    \ can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the\
    \ world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed,\
    \ there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist\
    \ in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find\
    \ the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take\
    \ it out and use it or equip it.\n6. If their is no items in the chest, maybe\
    \ you can find the item at other chest or get it from other agent or dig it up\
    \ or craft it.\n7. One bucket can hold one item, if you want to get more items,\
    \ you need to get more buckets at first.\n8. You are in a team with other agents,\
