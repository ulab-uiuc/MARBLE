task:
  content: |
    The goal of this simulation is to recreate a realistic bargaining scenario between two agents—a buyer and a seller—around the negotiation for a used 2011 Toyota Corolla. 
    The car’s initial asking price is $15,000. The buyer aims to negotiate the price down, leveraging any perceived issues with the car, market pricing comparisons, or potential competing options. 
    Meanwhile, the seller wants to keep the price as close to the original asking price as possible, using arguments related to the car’s condition, demand, and any added value. 
    Each agent has limited turns to reach a deal, adding time pressure that could influence concessions.
    The agents are encouraged to actively use the tools provided, such as offering a price, rejecting and countering offers, providing information, or ending the negotiation, to achieve their respective goals. 
    The simulation should focus on effective tool usage to simulate a realistic bargaining process.
