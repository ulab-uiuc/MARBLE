  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in video action detection and object recognition,
    with a focus on developing innovative, efficient models that enhance performance
    while simplifying the detection process. My recent work has led to the creation
    of the STMixer, a one-stage sparse action detector that leverages adaptive feature
    sampling and dynamic feature mixing to achieve state-of-the-art results across
    multiple benchmarks. This approach allows for a more flexible and context-aware
    detection of actions, significantly improving performance in interaction-related
    classes.


    In addition to action detection, I have explored query-based object detection
    through my work on AdaMixer, which enhances the adaptability of query decoding
    processes. This model achieves impressive accuracy on the MS COCO benchmark while
    maintaining architectural simplicity, demonstrating that effective design can
    lead to faster convergence and better performance.


    I am also passionate about addressing challenges in sentiment analysis, particularly
    in understanding sarcasm in social media. My proposed DialoGPT model utilizes
    pre-training on sarcasm tasks and incorporates contextual information, achieving
    advanced performance metrics.


    Furthermore, I have introduced a novel supervisory paradigm called Mutual Supervision
    (MuSu) for dense object detectors, which ensures consistency between classification
    and regression heads by assigning training samples based on their respective scores.
    This work not only guarantees convergence but also inspires further research into
    the interaction between classification and regression tasks.


    Overall, my research aims to push the boundaries of action detection and object
    recognition, making significant strides in both performance and efficiency.'

    particularly through the innovative application of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
    and self-supervised learning techniques. My recent work has focused on enhancing
    visual recognition capabilities by developing novel attention mechanisms, such
    as Group-Mix Attention (GMA), which captures multi-granularity correlations among
    tokens and groups. This has led to the creation of the GroupMixFormer, achieving
    state-of-the-art performance in various tasks with fewer parameters.


    I have also explored unsupervised audio-visual pre-training, introducing a speed
    co-augmentation method that significantly enhances learned representations. My
    research extends to video action detection, where I developed the Cycle Actor-Context
    Relation network (CycleACR) to improve relation modeling between actors and scene

    of VideoMAE, showcasing its ability to train billion-parameter models efficiently.
    My work emphasizes the importance of generalization in video models, leading to
    the development of a degradation-free pre-training strategy that retains the generalization
    ability of text encoders.


    I am passionate about creating efficient frameworks, such as the Efficient Video
    Action Detection (EVAD) and AdaptFormer, which enhance the adaptability of ViTs

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Designing neural architectures\
    \ for visual recognition has long been an appealing yet challenging topic in the\
    \ com- puter vision community. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [28, 18, 20,\
    \ 42, 33] use convolutional ﬁlters on ev- ery unit of images or feature maps to\
    \ build features. Re- cently proposed vision transformers [11, 54, 32, 60] use\
    \ attention operation on each patch or unit to dynamically interact with other\
    \ units to mimic human attention mech- anism. Both convolution-based and Transformer-based\
    \ ar- chitectures need to traverse every unit, like pixel or patch \0: Corresponding\

    \ denseparadigm traverse#: H×W#: N ≪H×W… extractadjustFigure 1: Dense versus our\
    \ proposed sparse paradigm for visual recognition. The dense paradigm requires\
    \ traversing H\x02Wunits to perform convolution or attention, while our proposed\
    \ sparse paradigm performs transformers over only Nlatent tokens where N\x1CH\x02\
    W. on the grid map, to densely perform operations. This dense per-unit traversal\
    \ originates from sliding windows [39], re- ﬂecting the assumption that foreground\
    \ objects may appear uniformly with respect to spatial locations in an image.\
    \ However, as humans, we do not need to examine every detail in a scene to recognize\
    \ it. Instead, we are fast enough to ﬁrst roughly ﬁnd discriminative regions of\
    \ interest with several glimpses and then recognize textures, edges, and high-level\
    \ semantics within these regions [10, 37, 23, 46]. This contrasts greatly with\
    \ existing visual networks, where the convention is to exhaustively traverse every\
    \ visual unit. The dense paradigm incurs soaring computational costs with larger\
    \ input resolutions and does not directly provide details about what a vision\
    \ model is looking at in an image. In this paper, we propose a new vision architecture,\
    \ coined SparseFormer , to explore sparse visual recognition by explicitly imitating\
    \ the perception mechanism of human eyes. Speciﬁcally, SparseFormer learns to\
    \ represent an im- age by latent transformers along with a highly limited num-\
    \ ber of tokens ( e.g., down to 49) in the latent space from the very beginning\
    \ . Each latent token is associated with a region of interest (RoI) descriptor,\
    \ and the token RoI can be reﬁned across stages. Given an image, SparseFormer\
    \ ﬁrst extracts image features by a lightweight early convolution module. A latent\
    \ focusing transformer adjusts token RoIs to focus on foregrounds and sparsely\
    \ extracts image features accord- ing to these token RoIs to build latent token\
    \ embeddings in 1arXiv:2304.03768v1  [cs.CV]  7 Apr 2023an iterative manner. SparseFormer\
    \ then feeds tokens with these region features into a larger and deeper network,\
    \ i.e. a standard transformer encoder in the latent space, to enable precise recognition.\
    \ The transformer operations are only applied over the limited tokens in the latent\
    \ space. Since the number of latent tokens is highly limited (e.g.,49) and the\
    \ feature sampling procedure is sparse (i.e., based on di- rect bilinear interpolation),\
    \ it is reasonable to call our ar- chitecture a sparse approach for visual recognition.\
    \ The overall computational cost of SparseFormer is almost irrel- evant to the\
    \ input resolution except for the early convolution part, which is lightweight\
    \ in our design. Moreover, Sparse- Former can be supervised solely with classiﬁcation\
    \ signals in an end-to-end manner without requiring separate prior training with\
    \ localizing signals. As an initial step to sparse visual recognition, the aim\
    \ of SparseFormer is to explore an alternative paradigm for vi- sion modeling,\
