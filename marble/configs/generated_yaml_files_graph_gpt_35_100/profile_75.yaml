  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of molecular docking
    and structure-based drug design (SBDD) through innovative computational methods.
    My recent work has led to the development of DeltaDock, a robust framework that
    enhances molecular docking efficiency by integrating ligand-dependent binding
    site prediction with multi-scale iterative refinement. This two-step approach
    not only improves docking accuracy but also addresses challenges such as generalization
    to unseen proteins and the prediction of physically valid structures.


    In addition to DeltaDock, I have introduced Multi-task Bioassay Pre-training (MBP),
    a pioneering framework that leverages a large dataset, ChEMBL-Dock, to enhance
    protein-ligand binding affinity (PLBA) predictions. By treating the prediction
    of different affinity labels as distinct tasks, MBP effectively learns transferable
    structural knowledge, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance.


    My research also encompasses a comprehensive review of geometric deep learning
    applications in SBDD, where I analyze foundational tasks, prevalent 3D protein
    representations, and the challenges and opportunities within the field. I am passionate
    about bridging the gap between computational methods and practical applications
    in drug discovery, and I continuously seek to refine and expand the capabilities
    of machine learning in this domain. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the
    development of more efficient and reliable tools for drug design, ultimately facilitating
    the discovery of novel therapeutics.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Recent advancement\
    \ in geometric deep learning (GDL) [1, 2, 3] presents an innovative and promising\
    \ molecular docking paradigm to predict and understand the interactions between\
    \ target proteins and drugs, which is of paramount importance for drug discovery [4,\
    \ 5]. Unlike traditional docking methods that employ optimization algorithms to\
    \ sample and identify best binding poses [6, 7], GDL methods interpret molecular\
    \ docking as either a regression or generation task, eliminating the need for\
    \ intensive candidate sampling [8, 9, 10]. Studies have demonstrated that GDL\
    \ methods outperform their traditional counterparts, delivering enhancements in\
    \ both the accuracy of binding pose predictions, as measured by the root-mean-square\
    \ deviation (RMSD) metric, and the inference efficiency [11, 12].   According\
    \ to whether a prior pocket is given, molecular docking can be divided into blind\
    \ and site-specific docking [13]. Traditional sampling methods adeptly navigate\
    \ both scenarios, primarily differing in the scope of the search space they explore.\
    \ In contrast, GDL methods typically specialize in either one. For instance, EquiBind [8],\
    \ and DiffDock [9] are designed for blind docking, neglecting the incorporation\
    \ of binding pockets. Uni-Mol [14] and DiffBind-FR [15] concentrate on site-specific\
    \ docking and only protein atomic level structure within a defined radius (usually\
    \ 6-12 Å) of the co-crystal is modeled. Despite some progress, these methods not\
    \ only fail to handle two docking settings smoothly like traditional methods,\
    \ but also confronted with certain limitations. For blind docking methods, they\
    \ ignore the fine-grained protein side-chain structure. Regarding the site-specific\
    \ docking methods, when dealing with pockets larger than the predetermined cutoff\
    \ or when there is a requirement to model extensive pocket surrounding structures\
    \ to account for long-range interactions, these methods significantly deteriorate\
    \ in performance [16] and the demand for computational resources can escalate\
    \ significantly, as evidenced in Appendix.A.2 and Appendix.A.3.   Besides these\
    \ challenges, current GDL methods face additional limitations due to the lack\
    \ of inductive biases, such as penalties for steric clashes or constraints on\
    \ ligand mobility, leading to the generation of unrealistic docking poses. Buttenschoen\
    \ et al. [16] proposed the PoseBusters test suit to verify and highlight these\
    \ problems. In addition to the RMSD between predicted and ground-truth poses,\
    \ the test suite incorporates 18 checks, encompassing chemical validity and consistency,\
    \ intramolecular validity, and intermolecular validity. According to the test\
    \ suite, the previously highest-performing method, DiffDock, achieves a success\
    \ rate of only 14%. This is significantly lower than the 38% success rate achieved\
    \ when chemical validity is not taken into account.   To resolve these problems,\
    \ we propose DeltaDock, a unified GDL framework for accurate, efficient, and physically\
    \ valid docking. DeltaDock is a two-stage framework consisting of a pocket prediction\
    \ stage and a site-specific docking stage. With \"Delta\", we mean that the optimal\
    \ poses are predicted by iteratively refining the input structures in the second\
    \ docking stage. The first pocket prediction stage is specialized for blind docking,\
    \ where a binding pocket is identified from a set of candidates through a novel\
    \ contrastive pocket-ligand alignment module CPLA. Then in the second stage, within\
    \ the pockets predefined or selected by CPLA, binding structures are predicted\
    \ in a bi-level coarse-to-fine iterative refinement module Bi-EGMN. This module\
    \ prioritizes the residue-level structure covered by a large outer box (Fig.4)\
    \ for pose positioning and coarse structure prediction. And the atom-level structure,\n\
