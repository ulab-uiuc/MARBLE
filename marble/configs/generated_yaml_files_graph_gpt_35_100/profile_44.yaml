    learning and biomedical applications through innovative neural network architectures.
    My recent work has focused on developing models that ensure equivariance in various
    contexts, such as the InfGCN, which combines coefficient learning with residual
    operators to learn mappings in 3D Euclidean space. This model not only captures

    biology, machine learning, and optimization. My work primarily focuses on protein
    structure prediction, where I have developed innovative statistical machine learning

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Recently, conditional\
    \ flow matching (CFM) models [36] have achieved remarkable success in various\
    \ generative domains including image generation [36, 18, 28], molecule [55, 54,\
    \ 30] and protein design [62, 11], and sequence generation [56, 37, 13]. While\
    \ attempts to generalize CFM and diffusion models to discrete categorical data\
    \ have been made, they typically exert ad hoc assumptions on the structure of\
    \ the discrete distribution. One group of work relies on stochastic jumps of Markov\
    \ chains in either the discrete-time [6, 37, 1] or continuous-time setting [12,\
    \ 51, 13] that discards the continuous nature of the underlying categorical distributions.\
    \ Other work directly works with the probability simplex [7, 56] or the corresponding\
    \ logit space [27, 38, 23] with potentially imperfect assumptions that fail to\
    \ capitulate the underlying true geometry of the statistical manifold. Furthermore,\
    \ likelihood is often approximated by variational bounds in previous discrete\
    \ generative models due to the lack of tractable exact likelihood.   We propose\
    \ to incorporate the intrinsic geometry of the statistical manifold by viewing\
    \ categorical data as points on the statistical manifold of categorical distributions.\
    \ Inspired by the mathematical results from information theory, we utilize the\
    \ Fisher information metric [48] to naturally equip such a manifold with a Riemannian\
    \ structure and develop an efficient generative training scheme for learning the\
    \ vector fields without stability issues. We summarize our contributions as the\
    \ following:   (1) We propose Statistical Flow Matching (SFM), a novel and mathematically\
    \ rigorous generative framework on the manifold of parameterized probability measures.\
    \ SFM does not pose any prior assumptions on the statistical manifold but instead\
    \ deduces its intrinsic geometry via mathematical tools. To tackle the discrete\
    \ generation problem, we instantiate SFM on the manifold of categorical distributions.\
    \ We deduce closed-form exponential and logarithm maps and develop an efficient\
    \ flow-matching training algorithm that avoids numerical issues by leveraging\
    \ a diffeomorphism between manifolds. SFM effectively leverages the intrinsic\
    \ geometric properties by following the shortest paths of geodesics between the\
    \ noise and target distributions on the statistical manifold.   (2) Our distinctive\
    \ geometric perspective of the statistical manifold allows us to further apply\
    \ optimal transport during training and derive tractable exact likelihood for\
    \ any given sample of probability measure, both of which are unachievable for\
    \ most existing methods. We also introduce new theoretical insights by establishing\
    \ connections among Riemannian flow matching, information geometry, and natural\
    \ gradient descent, which allows us to interpret SFM as following the steepest\
    \ descent of the natural gradient from the optimization angle.   (3) We demonstrated\
    \ with a toy example on simplex that SFM can learn more complex patterns on the\
    \ statistical manifold where existing models often fail due to impromptu prior\
    \ assumptions. We further conducted extensive experiments on diverse real-world\
    \ discrete generation tasks involving computer vision, natural language processing,\
    \ and bioinformatics. SFM consistently outperformed existing diffusion or flow-based\
    \ models and also achieved comparable results with autoregressive models on character-level\
    \ generation.     2 Preliminary   2.1 Information Geometry  In this work, we are\
    \ interested in learning a parameterized family of probability measures. It is\
    \ known from information theory that all probability measures over the sample\
    \ space form the structure known as statistical manifold. Mathematically, consider\
    \ probability densities p=d⁢μd⁢ν:\U0001D4B3→ℝ:\U0001D45D\U0001D451\U0001D707\U0001D451\
