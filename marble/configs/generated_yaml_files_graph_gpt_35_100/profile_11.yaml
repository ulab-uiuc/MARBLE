  profile: "I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of vision and\
    \ language, particularly through the lens of Vision Language Models (VLMs). My\
    \ recent work has focused on understanding how these models interpret atypical\
    \ visual media, such as advertisements that utilize unconventional imagery to\
    \ convey messages. I have developed novel tasks, including Multi-label Atypicality\
    \ Classification and Atypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' reasoning\
    \ capabilities in these contexts. \n\nIn addition to this, I have delved into\
    \ the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting and optimizing\
    \ communication for desired receiver behavior. My research introduces the concept\
    \ of \"behavior tokens,\" which are crucial for understanding how content influences\
    \ audience actions. By reintroducing these tokens into LLM training, I have developed\
    \ Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs) that not only match LLM performance\
    \ on content understanding tasks but also excel in behavior simulation and adaptation.\n\
    \nThrough my work, I aim to bridge the gap between technical communication and\
    \ its effectiveness, providing insights that can enhance how models understand\
    \ and generate persuasive content. I am committed to making my findings accessible,\
    \ as evidenced by my release of the Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) to foster further\
    \ research in this area."

  profile: "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of communication\
    \ theory and machine learning, particularly focusing on the capabilities of Large\

    \ \n\nIn my latest publication, I introduce Large Content and Behavior Models\
    \ (LCBMs), which aim to reintroduce \"behavior tokens\" into the training of LLMs.\
    \ These tokens represent various forms of receiver behavior, such as shares, likes,\

    \ By incorporating these tokens, I demonstrate that LCBMs not only match LLMs\
    \ in content understanding tasks but also excel in behavior simulation, content\
    \ simulation, and behavior domain adaptation.\n\nTo facilitate further research\
    \ in this area, I have released the Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), a comprehensive\

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of communication,
    behavior, and technology, particularly through the lens of Large Language Models
    (LLMs) and their applications in understanding and optimizing human interaction.
    My recent work has focused on addressing the third level of communication as defined
    by Shannon: effectiveness. I introduced Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs),
    which reintroduce "behavior tokens" into LLM training to enhance their ability
    to predict and optimize receiver behavior. This work not only demonstrates improved
    performance on content understanding tasks but also showcases capabilities in
    behavior simulation and understanding.


    Additionally, I have made significant strides in the field of advertising by releasing
    the LAMBDA dataset, the first large-scale study on ad memorability, and developing
    a model named Henry that predicts ad memorability with state-of-the-art accuracy.
    My approach, SEED, leverages this dataset to generate more memorable advertisements,
    achieving a remarkable increase in memorability scores.


    I am also passionate about addressing social issues, such as toxic comments in
    online spaces, and have worked on developing models for abusive comment identification
    in low-resource languages like Tamil. Furthermore, I have created Videos2Doc,
    a framework that automates document generation from procedural videos, making
    multimedia content more accessible.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and human behavior,
    fostering a deeper understanding of how communication can be optimized for better
    engagement and impact.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of communication,
    behavior, and artificial intelligence, particularly through the lens of large
    language models (LLMs) and multimedia content. My recent work emphasizes the importance
    of receiver behavior—such as likes and comments—in enhancing LLMs'' content understanding
    capabilities. By training models to predict these behaviors, I have demonstrated
    significant performance improvements across various tasks, showcasing the potential
    of leveraging behavior data as a "free lunch" in model training.


    I have also developed benchmarks like PersuasionBench and PersuasionArena to measure
    the persuasive abilities of generative models, revealing insights into how model
    size and targeted training can influence persuasiveness. My research extends to
    the legal domain, where I have created models for legal judgment prediction and
    citation-worthiness detection, addressing the complexities of legal language and
    the need for fairness in AI applications.


    Additionally, I have ventured into multimedia understanding, proposing innovative
    methods for generating natural language descriptions of videos and predicting
    ad memorability. My work aims to bridge gaps in existing datasets and methodologies,
    ultimately contributing to more effective and ethically responsible AI systems.
    I am passionate about advancing our understanding of how AI can shape communication
    and influence behavior, and I actively encourage collaboration and exploration
    in this rapidly evolving field.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of communication,
    behavior, and large language models (LLMs). My work focuses on understanding how
    receiver behavior—such as likes and comments—can enhance the content-understanding
    capabilities of LLMs. By training these models to predict receiver behavior, I
    have demonstrated significant improvements across various content understanding
    tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on 46 benchmarks.


    I am also passionate about the societal implications of LLMs, particularly in
    their ability to generate persuasive content. To address this, I developed PersuasionBench
    and PersuasionArena, the first large-scale benchmarks for measuring the persuasiveness
    of generative models. My findings challenge the notion that larger models are
    inherently more persuasive, revealing that smaller models can outperform larger
    counterparts through targeted training.


    In addition to my work on persuasion, I have contributed to the understanding
    of adversarial vulnerabilities in NLP models and the importance of behavior tokens
    in LLM training. My research has led to the creation of the Content Behavior Corpus
    (CBC) and the LAMBDA dataset, which provide valuable resources for further exploration
    in these areas.


    Overall, my goal is to bridge the gap between communication theory and practical
    applications of AI, ensuring that our advancements in technology are aligned with
    ethical considerations and societal benefits. I invite collaboration and discussion
    within the research community to further explore these critical topics.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Figure 1: Encoding\
    \ and predicting content (images, videos, and text) and behavior in the language\
    \ space. Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs), once trained, can enable a host\
    \ of different applications, including behavior simulation, content understanding,\
    \ content-behavior optimization, and content-behavior understanding.         \
    \     (a)      (b)       (c)      (d)     Figure 2:   Comparison of GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\
    \ Vicuna-13B, and LCBM-13B on: (a) Behavior Simulation accuracy on two types of\
    \ behaviors: replay value prediction and likes/views prediction. The task is,\
    \ given the video content and channel information, to predict replay values corresponding\
    \ to each scene and the ratio of likes to views. (b) Content simulation and behavior\
    \ understanding tasks. The task for content simulation is, given the channel information\
    \ and scene-level behavior, to predict the scene content. Given information on\
    \ the video platform and the video content, the task of behavior understanding\
    \ is to predict and explain the sentiments of the viewers and the commenters.\
    \ Six evaluators scored the models’ explanations between 0-5 to get the predicted\
    \ sentiment and explanation scores by comparing the ratings and reasons with the\
    \ user comments. The annotators did not know which model gave the reasoning. (c) Content\
    \ understanding tasks. We evaluate four tasks: emotion, topic, and persuasion\
    \ strategy prediction, and action-and-reason understanding. (d) Behavior Simulation\
    \ on in-house Email Marketing Data (R2superscript\U0001D4452R^{2}italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT score) and Twitter likes (accuracy), and Content Simulation\
    \ on Twitter tweet prediction (BLEU/ROUGE scores). It can be noted that on the\
    \ behavior simulation, content simulation, and behavior understanding tasks, LCBM\
    \ performs better than 3-shot GPT-3.5 and 10-shot GPT-4 (covering a larger area.\
    \ On the content understanding tasks, while LCBM outperforms similar-sized Vicuna\
    \ models, GPT-3.5 performs better. However, we also note that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\
    \ are at least 12 times larger than LCBM-13B. Further, we show the behavior domain\
    \ adaptation results in Table 4,  10,  10.    Shannon & Weaver (1949), in their\
    \ seminal paper on communication, includes all of the procedures by which one\
    \ mind may affect another. This includes all forms of expression, such as words,\
    \ gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. They mentioned that the broad\
    \ problem of communication can be studied at three levels: technical, semantic,\
    \ and effectiveness.   Level A: Technical. How accurately can the symbols of communication\
    \ be transmitted?   Level B: Semantic. How precisely do the transmitted symbols\
    \ convey the desired meaning?   Level C: Effectiveness. How well does the received\
    \ meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build\
    \ on top of each other. Thus, solving the problem at Level C necessarily requires\
    \ solving the corresponding problems at Levels A and B.   Since the publication\
    \ of this seminal paper, the tremendous growth in the field of telecommunications,\
    \ particularly the advent of the Internet and mobile devices, has led to affordable,\
    \ wide-scale solutions for Level A. With the recent advances in large language\
    \ models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-3 and 4 (Brown et al.,\
    \ 2020; OpenAI, 2023), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and many more, we have witnessed\
    \ a significant improvement in the performance of various Natural Language Processing\
    \ (NLP) tasks. LLMs in zero- or few-shot settings can easily handle tasks such\
    \ as question answering, summarization, translation, and many more. This has helped\
    \ us progress towards solving Level B\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n       \
