  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being\
    \ bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of\
    \ the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\_(Krumm et\_\
    al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender\
    \ systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\_(Liu et\_al.,\
    \ 2019), news\_(Wang et\_al., 2018b) and e-commerce\_(Chen et\_al., 2019b) platforms.\n\
    While complicated models\_(Pi et\_al., 2020; Qin et\_al., 2021; Lin et\_al., 2023b;\
    \ Wang et\_al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes\
    \ online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\_(Pi et\_al.,\
    \ 2019). On the other hand, simple models\_(Huang et\_al., 2013; Rendle, 2010)\
    \ have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently\
    \ because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between\
    \ efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information\
    \ that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\_1 (a), one widely used\
    \ solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\_(Wang et\_\
    al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\n\
    In the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage\
    \ in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\_\
    (Qin et\_al., 2022; Zhu et\_al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly\
    \ eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers\
    \ in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the\
    \ top-K\U0001D43EKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\n\
    As shown in Figure\_1 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are\
    \ arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval\
    \ and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\_(Wang et\_al.,\
    \ 2020d) and re-ranking\_(Xi et\_al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and\
    \ the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios.\
    \ Additionally, on the left side of Figure\_1 (a), we display the approximate\
    \ output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific\
    \ to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture\
    \ in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval.\
    \ The latter will be detailed further in Section \_2.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the\
    \ retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage\
    \ has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in candidate sets\
    \ (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through\
    \ the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking\
    \ stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the\
    \ retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\
    \n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due\
    \ to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly,\
    \ utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements.\
    \ As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\n\
    In contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing\
    \ various feature interaction operators, such as product operators\_(Qu et\_al.,\
    \ 2016), convolutional operators\_(Li et\_al., 2019a), and attention operators\_\
    (Xiao et\_al., 2017). The ranking stage further enhances its capability\n\n  \
