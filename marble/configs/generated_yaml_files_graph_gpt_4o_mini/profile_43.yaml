  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Deep neural networks (DNNs)\
    \ have found widespread use in modeling tasks from experimental systems neuroscience.\
    \ The allure of DNN-based models lies in their ease of training and the flexibility\
    \ they offer in architecting systems with desired properties [1 –3]. In contrast,\
    \ neurodynamical models like the Wilson-Cowan [4] or the Stabilized Supralinear\
    \ Network (SSN) [5] are more biologically plausible than DNNs, but these models\
    \ confront considerable training challenges due to the lack of stability guarantees\
    \ for high-dimensional problems. The primary reason training RNNs is more straightforward\
    \ is because of specialized ad hoc implementation of regularization techniques\
    \ like batch and layer normalization, and gradient clipping/scaling. These methods\
    \ (Batch, Layer, Group) in tasks such as image recognition with convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs) [40] and language modeling with recurrent neural networks\
    \ (RNNs) [39, 41]. Despite the foundational role of these techniques in deep learning\
    \ algorithms, their implementation is ad-hoc, limiting their conceptual relevance.\
    \ They serve as practical solutions addressing the limitations of current machine\
    \ learning frameworks rather than offering principled insights derived from understanding\
    \ cortical circuits. It has been proposed that DN is achieved via a recurrent\
    \ circuit [11,13,42 –46]. Oscillatory Recurrent Gated Neural Integrator Circuits\
    \ (ORGaNICs) are rate-based recurrent neural circuit models that implement DN\
    \ dynamically via recurrent amplification [46, 47]. Since ORGaNICs’ response follows\
    \ the DN equation at steady-state, it incorporates this wide variety of neural\
    \ phenomena. ORGaNICs have been shown to simulate key neurophysiological and cognitive/perceptual\
    \ phenomena under realistic biophysical constraints [46, 47]. Additional phenomena\
    \ not explained by DN [48] can in principle be integrated into the model. In this\
    \ paper, however, we focus on the effects of DN on the dynamical stability of\
    \ ORGaNICs. Despite some empirical evidence that ORGaNICs are highly robust, the\
    \ question of whether the model is stable for arbitrary parameter choices, and\
    \ thus whether it can be robustly trained on ML tasks by backpropagation-through-time\
    \ (BPTT), remains open. Here, we establish the unconditional stability — applicable\
    \ across all parameters and inputs — of a multidimensional two-neuron-type ORGaNICs\
    \ circuit model when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We prove this\
    \ result, detailed in Section 4, by performing linear stability analysis around\
    \ the model’s analytically-known normalization fixed point and by reducing the\
    \ stability problem to that of a high-dimensional mechanical system, whose stability\
    \ is defined in terms of a quadratic eigenvalue problem. We then address the stability\
    \ of the model for arbitrary recurrent weight matrix in Section 5. While the indirect\
    \ method of Lyapunov becomes intractable for such a system, we provide proof of\
    \ unconditional stability for a two-dimensional circuit with an arbitrary recurrent\
    \ weight matrix and offer empirical evidence supporting the claim of stability\
    \ for high-dimensional systems. ORGaNICs are a biophysically plausible extensions\
    \ of Long Short Term Memory units (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), RNN\
    \ architectures that have been widely used in machine learning applications [3,\
    \ 49 –52], the main differences being that ORGaNICs are continuous time and have\
    \ built-in normalization and built-in attention. Thus, ORGaNICs should be able\
    \ to solve relatively sophisticated tasks [46]. Here, we demonstrate (Section\
    \ 6) that by virtue of their intrinsic stability, ORGaNICs can be trained on sequence\
    \ modeling tasks by BPTT, in the same manner as traditional RNNs (unlike SSN that\
    \ instead requires costly specialized training strategies [53]), despite implementing\
    \ power-law activations [5]. Moreover, we show that ORGaNICs achieves performance\
