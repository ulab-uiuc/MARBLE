  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Deep neural networks\
    \ have shown remarkable success at learning task-specific representations of data\
    \ when provided supervision from massive amounts of labeled training examples.\
    \ Recent trends, however, have shifted toward task-agnostic, universal representations\
    \ that may be easily fine-tuned or even have zero-shot capabilities out-of-the-box.\
    \ Supervised learning, stricto sensu, is too limited a framework for these billion-parameter,\
    \ data-hungry models, and a question at the heart of modern machine learning is\
    \ learning from unlabelled, partially labeled, or weakly labeled data.   This\
    \ need has paved the way for the current generation of self-supervised learning\
    \ (SSL) approaches that circumvent the need for large amounts of strong labels.\
    \ In SSL, a model is trained on a generic pseudo-task that can be performed on\
    \ unlabelled data, such as relating the two modalities of an image-caption pair\
    \ or two augmentations of the same image. Despite several modern foundation models\
    \ such as DINO (Caron et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2024) and CLIP (Radford et al.,\
    \ 2021) being trained in this fashion, many aspects of SSL remain baffling.  \
    \ In particular, the training process of self-supervised models often outgrows\
    \ and “breaks the rules” of the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) toolkit.\
    \ ERM combines two well-understood techniques: minibatch sampling and gradient-based\
    \ optimization using backpropagation. SSL, on the other hand, adds clever, less-understood\
    \ techniques to the training pipeline. To illustrate this, consider a minibatch\
    \ ℳn={Z1,…,Zn}subscriptℳ\U0001D45Bsubscript\U0001D44D1…subscript\U0001D44D\U0001D45B\

    \ italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )  (1)   and backpropagating through it to produce\
    \ a minibatch stochastic gradient estimate. The algorithm then proceeds with the\
    \ stochastic gradient training, or a variant thereof.   On the other hand, self-supervised\
    \ methods often modify this recipe by intervening on the optimization algorithm\
    \ in a minibatch-specific way. For example, SwaV (Caron et al., 2020) passes the\
    \ minibatch examples through the model’s encoder and clusters output vectors to\
    \ generate pseudo-labels for a prediction task. In teacher-student architectures\
    \ such as BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) and DINO (Caron et al., 2021), the data are\
    \ passed through two networks, where the “student” is updated via backpropagation\
    \ and the “teacher” is updated by cloning the student’s weights in regular intervals.\
    \ In CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), a model optimizes the sum of two cross entropy\
    \ loss terms, where the predicted class probabilities on example i\U0001D456iitalic_i\
    \ are generated by comparison to all other elements of the minibatch. These steps\
    \ are often motivated as constraints to avoid representation collapse, wherein\
    \ the pseudo-task can be solved by a trivial representation, e.g. mapping all\
    \ data to the zero vector. Conceptually, however, it is difficult to see what\
    \ exactly is being optimized when introducing\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n\
