  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures
    and exploring innovative solutions.


    One of my notable contributions is the development of Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs),
    which effectively capture the positional context of nodes within a graph, significantly
    improving performance in tasks like link prediction and community detection. I
    also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities, leading to substantial
    accuracy improvements across various prediction tasks.


    Recognizing the challenges posed by dynamic graphs, I proposed the ROLAND framework,
    which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments,
    ensuring scalability and efficiency. My research also delves into the architectural
    design space of GNNs, where I systematically explored over 315,000 designs to
    provide guidelines for optimizing performance across different tasks.


    In addition to GNNs, I have ventured into automated machine learning (AutoML)
    with methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer, which aim to streamline the search
    for optimal model designs while leveraging prior knowledge to enhance efficiency.
    My work is driven by a passion for uncovering the intricate relationships within
    graph structures and translating these insights into practical applications that
    push the boundaries of machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the safety and efficiency of
    autonomous systems, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning (RL)
    and maritime navigation. My work focuses on integrating formal specifications,
    such as temporal logic, into RL frameworks to ensure compliance with safety regulations,
    especially in critical environments like maritime traffic. I have developed innovative
    approaches that combine probabilistic safety guarantees with RL, allowing agents
    to learn optimal actions while adhering to safety constraints.


    One of my significant contributions is the design of a safety shield for nonlinear
    continuous systems, which projects potentially unsafe actions to the nearest safe
    alternatives. This method effectively handles dynamic obstacles and input constraints,
    ensuring robust safety even in high-dimensional systems. Additionally, I have
    conducted comprehensive evaluations of various provably safe RL methods, providing
    insights into their performance across different applications.


    My research also extends to the sustainable management of seaweed farms in the
    open ocean, where I have developed dynamic programming-based controllers that
    optimize growth by leveraging ocean currents. By addressing the challenges posed
    by forecast uncertainties, my methods demonstrate the feasibility of low-power
    propulsion systems in maximizing seaweed biomass for climate mitigation.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning techniques

    deep reinforcement learning (RL) in robotic applications, particularly in human-robot
    collaboration (HRC). My work addresses the critical challenge of ensuring safety
    in dynamic environments, where human interaction is inevitable. I have developed
    a shielding mechanism that guarantees ISO-verified human safety during the training
    and deployment of RL algorithms on manipulators, significantly enhancing performance
    by preventing collisions.


    In my recent research, I introduced innovative safety intervention reduction methods

    for safe RL in HRC, which includes a safety shield to ensure human safety during
    training. This suite bridges the gap between theoretical RL research and practical
    applications, providing a robust framework for evaluating RL methods.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  \\Ac RL can solve\
    \ complex tasks in robotics [Han2023-roboticRLsurvey], games [shao2019survey],\
    \ and is used for fine-tuning large language models [ouyang2022training]. Yet,\
    \ training  reinforcement learning (RL) agents is often sample-inefficient due\
    \ to frequent exploration of actions, which are irrelevant to learning a good\
    \ policy. Examples for irrelevant actions are driving into a wall for autonomous\
    \ cars, or tipping a drone off-balance. The global action space is typically large\
    \ in relation to the relevant actions in each state. Therefore, exploring these\
    \ actions frequently can introduce unnecessary costs, lead to slow convergence,\
    \ or even prevent the agent from learning a suitable policy.   Action masking\
    \ mitigates this problem by constraining the exploration to the set of relevant\
    \ state-specific actions, which can be obtained based on task knowledge. For example,\
    \ when there is no opponent within reach in video games, attack actions are masked\
    \ from the action space [Ye2020-MOBAmasking]. Leveraging task knowledge through\
    \ action masking usually leads to faster convergence and also increases the predictability\
    \ of the RL agent as the set of relevant actions can provide additional meaning.\
    \ For instance, if the set of relevant actions is a set of verified safe actions,\
    \ action masking can be used to provide safety guarantees [Fulton2018, Krasowski2023b.ProvablySafeRLSurvey].\
    \   Whenever the relevant action set is easy to compute, action masking can be\
    \ seamlessly integrated into RL algorithms and is the quasi-standard for discrete\
    \ action spaces [Zhong_Yang_Zhao_2024, Shakya2023], e.g., in motion planning [Mirchevska2018,\
    \ Krasowski2020, Xiaofei2022-masking, Rudolf2022, Feng2023], games [Huang2022,\
    \ Ye2020-MOBAmasking, Hou2023-maskinggames], and power systems [Tabas2022, Lingyu2023].\
    \ However, real-world systems operate in continuous space and discretization to\
    \ a higher-level decision space might prevent learning optimal policies. Furthermore,\
    \ simulation of real-world systems is compute-intensive, and developing RL agents\
    \ for them often requires additional real-world training [zhao_sim-to-real_2020].\
    \ Thus, sample efficiency is particularly valuable for these applications.   In\
    \ this work, we propose three action masking methods for continuous action spaces.\
    \ They employ expressive convex set representations, i.e., polytopes or zonotopes\
    \ for the relevant action set. Our action masking methods generalize previous\
    \ work in [Krasowski2023b.ProvablySafeRLSurvey], which is constrained to intervals\
    \ as relevant action sets. This extends the applicability of continuous action\
    \ masking to expressive convex relevant action sets, which is especially useful\
    \ when action dimensions are coupled, e.g., for a thrust-controlled quadrotor.\
    \ To integrate the relevant action set into RL, we introduce three methods: the\
    \ generator mask, which exploits the generator representation of a zonotope, the\
    \ ray mask, which projects an action into the relevant action set based on radial\
    \ directions, and the distributional mask, which truncates the policy distribution\
    \ to the relevant action set. In summary our main contributions are:     •  We\
    \ introduce continuous action masking based on arbitrary convex sets representing\
    \ the state-dependent relevant action sets;    •  We present three methods to\
    \ utilize the relevant action sets and derive their integration in the backward\
    \ pass of RL with stochastic policies;    •  We evaluate our approach on three\
    \ benchmark environments that demonstrate the application conditions of our continuous\
    \ action masking approaches.       1.1 Related literature  Action masking is mainly\
    \ applied for discrete action spaces [Fulton2018, Mirchevska2018, Krasowski2020,\
    \ Xiaofei2022-masking, Rudolf2022, Feng2023, Huang2022, Ye2020-MOBAmasking, Hou2023-maskinggames,\
    \ Tabas2022, Lingyu2023, Krasowski2023b.ProvablySafeRLSurvey, Zhong_Yang_Zhao_2024,\
    \ varricchione2024a-safemaskingLTL]. Huang et al. [Huang2022] derive the implications\
    \ on policy gradient RL\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
