    and machine learning, focusing on the intersection of theoretical and applied
    sciences. My recent work has explored various conjectures in dynamical systems,
    particularly concerning periodic points in continuous maps, where I successfully
    proved a conjecture for five intervals. I have also delved into the realm of area-minimizing
    hypersurfaces, establishing regularity results in singular ambient manifolds,
    which contribute to our understanding of geometric analysis.


    In astrophysics, I have investigated the origins of supermassive black holes,
    utilizing data from the Event Horizon Telescope to support theories of hierarchical
    mergers. My research extends to the dynamics of gamma-ray bursts and their afterglows,
    where I analyze the effects of dense environments on transient emissions. Additionally,

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance
    in tasks like link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My research doesn''t stop at static graphs; I proposed the ROLAND framework
    to effectively handle dynamic graphs, allowing for scalable and efficient learning
    in real-world applications.


    In addition to architectural innovations, I have explored the design space of
    GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 designs to provide guidelines for optimizing
    performance across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON
    and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the process of finding optimal model designs
    by leveraging prior knowledge and enhancing search efficiency.


    Through these contributions, I strive to push the boundaries of what GNNs can
    achieve, fostering a deeper understanding of their structure and performance while
    making them more accessible for diverse applications.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Availability attacks (Biggio\
    \ & Roli, 2018) add impercep- tible perturbations to the training data, making\
    \ the subse- quently trained model unavailable. The motivations behind these attacks\
    \ involve protecting private data and commer- cial datasets from unauthorized\
    \ use. For example, a ma- licious data collector may gather selfies from social\
    \ me- dia apps into a facial image set. In this type of scenario, availability\
    \ attacks provide tools to process user images be- fore release, preserving legibility\
    \ but impeding subsequent training. In recent years, various availability attacks\
    \ have been proposed (Feng et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2020; Fowl 1Academy of\
    \ Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190,\
    \ China2University of Chi- nese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China. Correspon-\
    \ dence to: Xiao-Shan Gao <xgao@mmrc.iss.ac.cn >.et al., 2021) against supervised\
    \ learning (SL). Meanwhile, contrastive learning (CL) allows people to ex- tract\
    \ meaningful features from unlabeled data in a self- supervised way. After subsequent\
    \ linear probing or fine- tuning, CL algorithms have achieved comparable accuracy\
    \ or even surpassed the performance of SL (Chen et al., 2020a;b; Grill et al.,\
    \ 2020; Chen & He, 2021). Thus, an unauthorized data collector can resort to contrastive\
    \ learn- ing algorithms to train a usable model when supervised learning has failed.\
    \ On one hand, most attacks designed for poisoning SL are ineffective against\
    \ CL (refer to Table 1 and Section 3.2). It shed light on a potential issue of\
    \ using availability attacks to protect data: a malicious data collec- tor can\
    \ traverse both supervised and contrastive algorithms to effectively leverage\
    \ collected data. On the other hand, the error minimization poisoning framework\
    \ has been ex- tended to poison contrastive learning (He et al., 2022), and then\
    \ components requiring label information have been in- corporated into contrastive\
    \ error minimization to simul- taneously achieve supervised unlearnability besides\
    \ con- trastive unlearnability (Ren et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a). Compared\
    \ to SL-based ones, these CL-based Background and Related Works 2.1. Contrastive\
    \ Learning Contrastive learning is self-supervised and does not require label\
    \ information until linear probing or fine-tuning. In general, it first augments\
    \ an input into two views using augmentations sampled from a strong augmentation\
    \ distri- bution µ. Then extracted features are trained to be aligned between\
    \ positive pairs but distinct between negative pairs. Wang & Isola (2020) introduced\
    \ two key properties for contrastive learning, alignment anduniformity . The former\
    \ measures the similarity of features from positive pairs and the latter reflects\
    \ the uniformity of feature distribution on the hypersphere. Let gbe a normalized\
    \ feature extractor. Thealignment loss anduniformity loss on a dataset Dcare defined\
    \ as the following: A(Dc) =E x∼Dc π,τ∼µ\x02 ||g(π(x))−g(τ(x))||2 2\x03 , U(Dc)\
    \ = log E x,z∼Dc π,τ∼µ\x02 e−2||g(π(x))−g(τ(z))||2 2\x03 . LetD′ cbe a poisoned\
    \ version of a clean dataset Dc. The alignment gap anduniformity gap between clean\
    \ and poi- soned datasets are defined as follows: AG=A(Dc)− A(D′ c),UG=U(Dc)−\
    \ U(D′ c).(1) Intuitively, these gaps characterize the difference between clean\
    \ features and poisoned features. We will check the re- lationship between these\
    \ gaps and contrastive unlearnabil- ity in Section 3.2. 2.2. Basic Availability\
    \ Attacks The essence of availability attacks is to prevent a trained model from\
    \ well generalizing to the clean data. Error minimization and maximization are\
    \ two representative ap- proaches to poisoning supervised learning. 2Efficient\
    \ Availability Attacks against Supervised and Contrastive Learning Simultaneously\
    \ Error minimization. Unlearnable example attacks (UE, Huang et al. 2020) generate\
    \ poisoning by alternately opti- mizing the reference model and perturbations:\
    \ min δmin fE Dc\x02 LSL(x+δ(x, y), y;f)\x03 , (2) where fis a classifier, LSL(·,·;·)is\
    \ the supervised loss, Dc is a dataset to be processed and δis a poisoning map.\
