  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of network science,
    machine learning, and optimization. My work primarily focuses on community detection
    in hypergraphs, where I have developed efficient algorithms for exact community
    recovery, particularly under the hypergraph stochastic block model. I have confirmed
    conjectures regarding semidefinite programming relaxations and introduced a spectral
    algorithm that achieves optimal performance with nearly linear runtime.


    In addition to community detection, I explore the effects of side information
    on exact recovery in block models, designing optimal spectral algorithms that
    leverage this information. My research also delves into the generalization behavior
    of overparameterized neural networks, where I provide rigorous analyses of tempered
    overfitting in two-layer ReLU networks, revealing complexities in their performance
    metrics.


    I have also contributed to the field of data streaming by extending quantile summaries
    to handle weighted inputs efficiently, addressing a significant gap in existing
    methodologies. Furthermore, I investigate distributed optimization techniques,
    particularly local SGD, where I provide new theoretical insights that bridge the
    gap between practice and theory, emphasizing the need for improved models of data
    heterogeneity.


    Overall, my research aims to develop robust algorithms and theoretical frameworks
    that enhance our understanding of complex systems, whether in community detection,
    machine learning, or optimization. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries
    of these fields and contributing to their advancement through innovative solutions.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  In recent years,\
    \ major efforts have been devoted to understanding which distributions can be\
    \ learned efficiently using gradient-type algorithms on generic models (Abbe and\
    \ Sandon, 2020; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020; Malach et al., 2021; Damian et al., 2022;\
    \ Abbe et al., 2021b, a, 2022, 2023; Bietti et al., 2023; Glasgow, 2023; Dandi\
    \ et al., 2023, 2024; Edelman et al., 2024; Kou et al., 2024). In this paper,\
    \ we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)),\
    \ that is functions that depend only on a small number P\U0001D443{P}italic_P\
    \ out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than\U0001D451\U0001D443d\\gg{P}italic_d\
    \ ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify\
    \ the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities,\
    \ learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)\U0001D442superscript\U0001D451\U0001D443\
    O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to\
    \ learn in O~⁢(d)~\U0001D442\U0001D451\\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG\
    \ ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What\
    \ is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe\
    \ et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle\
    \ dynamics that drives learning in this setting. The goal of the present paper\
    \ is to provide a general characterization for the complexity of learning sparse\
    \ functions that go beyond (i) hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and (ii) \U0001D5A2\
    \U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0\U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ (see\
    \ below) and focusing only on the squared loss.   The notion of complexity we\
    \ consider is the Statistical Query (\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0\
    {\\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations\
    \ up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002;\
    \ Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost\
    \ equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered\
    \ in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline\
    \ for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations\
    \ are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary\
    \ functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries\
    \ are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known,\
    \ which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical\
    \ Queries (\U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0\U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ)\
    \ which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries. Lower bounds\
    \ on the \U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0\U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ\
    \ complexity have thus been seen as corresponding to the complexity of gradient-based\
    \ learning222In Section 8, we discuss recent work Dandi et al. (2024) that showed\
    \ that even with the squared loss, multiple gradient evaluations on the same batch\
    \ can be strictly more powerful than \U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\U0001D5B0\U0001D5A2\U0001D5B2\
    \U0001D5B0{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ. in these restricted cases. Part of the motivation\
    \ for this paper is to emphasize that this relationship is limited to very specific\
    \ loss functions and does not hold more generally. In order to study the complexity\
    \ of gradient algorithms for general output and loss functions, we introduce a\
    \ type of statistical query which we call Differentiable Learning Query (\U0001D5A3\
    \U0001D5AB\U0001D5B0\U0001D5A3\U0001D5AB\U0001D5B0{\\sf DLQ}sansserif_DLQ). These\
    \ queries are defined with respect to a specific loss ℓℓ\\ellroman_ℓ—denoted by\
