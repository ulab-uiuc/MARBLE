  profile: 'I am a researcher with a diverse background in high-energy physics, mathematical
    physics, and machine learning applications. My recent work has focused on understanding
    collective phenomena in high-multiplicity hadronic collisions, particularly at
    the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). I have explored the emergence of a unified paradigm
    for describing collectivity across various collision systems, including proton-proton
    and nucleus-nucleus interactions.


    In addition to my work in particle physics, I have delved into the mathematical
    foundations of superconformal field theories and black hole solutions in supergravity.
    My research on the chiral algebra of 4D N=2 SCFTs has provided insights into the
    structure and classification of these theories, while my work on extremal black
    holes has advanced our understanding of moduli spaces in supergravity.


    I am also passionate about applying innovative computational techniques to solve
    complex problems. For instance, I have developed a novel Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm
    that not only secures blockchain transactions but also addresses high-dimensional
    optimization problems, demonstrating the potential of mining to yield scientific
    insights.


    My interdisciplinary approach extends to building intelligent agents for UI navigation,
    where I have successfully trained agents to achieve high success rates in complex
    environments. Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical concepts with practical
    applications, contributing to advancements in both fundamental physics and computational
    methodologies.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like
    link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, thereby enhancing their scalability
    and effectiveness.


    In addition to architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space
    of GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 designs to provide guidelines for
    optimizing performance across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly
    with FALCON and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for optimal model
    designs, making it more efficient and insightful.


    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of GNNs
    and machine learning, with the goal of making these technologies more accessible
    and effective for real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of artificial
    intelligence, psychology, and consumer behavior. My recent work includes an audit
    study of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Bing Chat, where I investigated
    how these platforms construct responses and establish authority on public topics.
    This research revealed significant biases in sentiment and source quality, emphasizing
    the importance of critical evaluation of AI outputs for informed decision-making.


    In another project, I developed Lemotif, an innovative system that combines natural
    language processing and image generation to help users reflect on their emotional
    experiences. By parsing journal entries for themes and emotions, Lemotif visualizes
    these insights, encouraging regular journaling and enhancing emotional awareness.


    Additionally, I have utilized ensemble feedforward neural networks to analyze
    consumer touchpoints and their influence on purchasing decisions. My approach
    outperformed traditional models and provided valuable insights into touchpoint
    effectiveness, demonstrating resilience even with limited data. Through my research,
    I aim to empower users and marketers alike, fostering a deeper understanding of
    emotional dynamics and consumer behavior in the digital age.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Recent work has studied\
    \ how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to build computer control\
    \ agents [17, 42, 38, 16, 6] that accomplish human tasks by interacting with a\
    \ computer environment. These agents perceive the state of the computer by observing\
    \ its screen (from screenshots or application UI trees), and generate actions\
    \ (click, type, scroll, etc.) that are executed through the computer’s user interface.\
    \ Tasks, specified in natural language, can range from configuring device settings\
    \ and sending emails, to navigating shopping websites and planning a trip.   While\
    \ progress is rapidly advancing, absolute performance of computer control agents\
    \ that leverage pre-trained LLMs without fine-tuning on task demonstrations is\
    \ still relatively low. When tested in real-world environments, where agents control\
    \ everyday applications and websites, recently-reported task success rates range\
    \ from 12% on desktop applications [37] to 46% on mobile applications [3]. In\
    \ contrast, agents that leverage models fine-tuned for task execution [24, 9],\
    \ achieve even 80% [9] success rate, when tested on websites and tasks similar\
    \ to what they are trained on.   While the pattern of collecting new datasets\
    \ and fine-tuning shows promise, there are at least two important unanswered questions.\
    \ First, to the best of our knowledge no prior work has examined the question\
    \ of scaling: how much data must be collected in order to obtain a given performance\
    \ level with fine-tuned models. This question is particularly important because\
    \ human demonstrations of computer interactions for fine-tuning are time consuming\
    \ and expensive to collect. Understanding how performance scales, both in domain\
    \ and out of the domain of the collected demonstrations (unseen tasks and unseen\
    \ applications), is important for determining whether fine-tuning alone is a viable\
    \ path towards deploying computer control agents in the real world. Therefore,\
    \ one of the main goals of this work is to rigorously quantify how performance\
    \ of fine-tuned agents scales, both in and out of domain, as the amount of data\
    \ used for fine-tuning is increased.   Second, it is not clear the level of task\
    \ complexity fine-tuning might be fruitfully applied to. Conceptually, computer\
    \ control agents must both decompose a high-level goal into a set of small atomic\
    \ actions and execute (“ground”) those actions in a device screen. While the high-level\
    \ reasoning with LLMs, required for determining how to accomplish high-level goals,\
    \ is still an open problem in artificial intelligence [34, 33, 41, 44, 18, 40,\
    \ 35], the set of low-level actions (clicking, typing, etc…) required to execute\
    \ tasks are more constrained, and general agents capable of robust grounding across\
    \ domains might be approachable via fine-tuning. Therefore, a second goal of this\
    \ work is to quantify the scaling of fine-tuning for agents performing both high-level\
    \ and low-level tasks.   Figure 1: An example task demonstration contained in\
    \ AndroidControl. Green circles/rectangles highlight the action on the screen.\
    \ Red numbers are added only for illustration purposes.   Rigorously quantifying\
    \ scaling in these ways requires a carefully constructed dataset. To this end,\
    \ we introduce AndroidControl, a large-scale dataset of 15,283 demonstrations\
    \ of tasks performed by humans in Android apps. Figure 1 shows an example data\
    \ sample. Compared to existing datasets [6, 26], for every task AndroidControl\
    \ provides both the high- and low-level human-generated instructions describing\n\
