  content: 'This database is used in an educational system to manage student, course,
    enrollment, and payment information. It consists of four tables: students, courses,
    enrollments, and payments.

    Recently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql
    queries to find out what is wrong, and find out the reason that caused it. The
    root cause can be only two of the following: ''INSERT_LARGE_DATA'', ''MISSING_INDEXES'',
    ''LOCK_CONTENTION'', ''VACUUM'', ''REDUNDANT_INDEX'', ''FETCH_LARGE_DATA'', ''POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION''.
    The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root
    cause and make final decision. Agents can also chat with each other to share information.  Please
    make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead
    to incorrect conclusions.

    \ \n'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA'\n\
