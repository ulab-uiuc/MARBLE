  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning,
    decision-making, and fairness in data analysis. My recent work has focused on
    multi-agent multi-armed bandit problems, where I explore collaborative strategies
    to minimize group regret while addressing arm heterogeneity and communication
    costs. I have developed innovative protocols, such as Flooding with Absorption
    (FwA), which significantly reduce communication overhead in complex networks.


    In addition to bandits, I have delved into episodic Block MDPs, where I derived
    efficient algorithms for model estimation and reward-free learning, demonstrating
    how exploiting block structures can enhance sample complexity. My research also
    extends to Fair Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where I introduced a new framework
    that balances fairness and statistical learnability, culminating in a memory-efficient
    algorithm for real-world applications.


    I am particularly interested in the dynamics of gradient descent with momentum,
    where I empirically and theoretically analyze its effects on training trajectories.
    My work in quantum computing has led to advancements in quantum state tomography,
    optimizing measurement strategies for large-scale qubit systems.


    Through my diverse research endeavors, I aim to contribute to the development
    of robust, efficient, and fair machine learning methodologies that can be applied
    across various domains, from online recommendation systems to medical imaging.
    I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in machine learning
    and ensuring that these advancements are accessible and equitable.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed
    Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes
    within graphs, significantly improving performance on tasks like link prediction
    and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    In addition to architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space
    of GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 designs to provide guidelines for
    optimizing performance across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly
    with FALCON and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for optimal model
    designs, making it more efficient and insightful.


    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of GNNs
    and machine learning, with the goal of making these technologies more effective
    and accessible for real-world applications.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  One paramount task\
    \ in statistics and machine learning is to estimate the uncertainty of the underlying\
    \ model from (possibly noisy) observations. For example, in interactive machine\
    \ learning scenarios such as bandits (Thompson, 1933; Robbins, 1952; Lattimore\
    \ and Szepesvári, 2020) and recently reinforcement learning with human feedback\
    \ (RLHF; Ouyang et al. (2022); Christiano et al. (2017)), at each time step t\U0001D461\
    titalic_t, the learner chooses an action \U0001D499tsubscript\U0001D499\U0001D461\
    {\\bm{x}}_{t}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from\
    \ an available set of actions \U0001D4B3tsubscript\U0001D4B3\U0001D461\\mathcal{X}_{t}caligraphic_X\

    \ that is modeled as a distribution whose mean is an unknown function f∗superscript\U0001D453\

    \ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; italic_f start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). One popular choice of such a model is generalized linear\
    \ model (GLM; McCullagh and Nelder (1989)) that extends exponential family distributions\
    \ to have linear structure in its natural parameter, i.e., ⟨\U0001D499,\U0001D73D\

    \ \U0001D73D⋆subscript\U0001D73D⋆\\bm{\\theta}_{\\star}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is an unknown parameter, which means that the mean function\
    \ is f∗⁢(\U0001D499)=μ⁢(⟨\U0001D499,\U0001D73D⋆⟩)superscript\U0001D453\U0001D499\

    \ ( bold_italic_x ) = italic_μ ( ⟨ bold_italic_x , bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟩ ) for some inverse link function μ\U0001D707\\muitalic_μ.\
    \ This encompasses a wide range of distributions, which in turn makes it ubiquitous\
    \ in various real-world applications, such as news recommendations (Bernoulli;\
    \ Li et al. (2010, 2012)), social network influence maximization (Poisson; Lage\
    \ et al. (2013); Gisselbrecht et al. (2015)), and more. In such tasks, the learner\

    \ italic_s = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT,\
    \ to make wise decisions. One popular and useful way to capture the uncertainty\

    \ components for safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) that can ensure the validity/safeness\
    \ of sequentially adaptive statistical inference (Ramdas et al., 2023).   There\
    \ has been much work on deriving CS for specific families of distributions. Many\
    \ common distributions are in a smaller family, called generalized linear models\
    \ (GLMs). Existing CSs for GLM, however, are far from ideal. Much of the prior\
    \ works focus on obtaining CS for specific instantiations of GLMs, such as Gaussian (Abbasi-Yadkori\
    \ et al., 2011; Flynn et al., 2023) and Bernoulli (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille\
    \ et al., 2021; Faury et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2024). Especially for Bernoulli,\
    \ all the existing CSs suffer from poly⁡(S)poly\U0001D446\\operatorname{poly}(S)roman_poly\
    \ ( italic_S ) factor in the radius, where S\U0001D446Sitalic_S is the norm of\

    \ Emmenegger et al. (2023) proposed generic CSs that work for any convex GLMs,\
    \ but their radii all suffer from a globally worst-case curvature of μ\U0001D707\
