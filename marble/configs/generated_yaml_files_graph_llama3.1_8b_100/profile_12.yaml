  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, with a particular focus on their applications in
    dynamic and signed networks. My work explores the rich syntactic diversity of
    the English language, revealing how non-canonical constructions enhance discourse
    coherence. This linguistic insight informs my approach to developing models that
    effectively capture complex relationships in graph data.


    In my recent research, I introduced the Pyramid Graph Neural Network (PyGNN),
    which innovatively combines downsampling and filtering techniques to learn multi-scale
    node embeddings. I also pioneered a model that integrates GNNs with Marked Temporal
    Point Processes for event forecasting on Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs, demonstrating
    significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.


    My contributions extend to the development of GNNRank, a framework for ranking
    recovery using directed graphs, and the creation of PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed,
    a comprehensive software package for analyzing signed and directed networks. I
    have also explored the magnetic signed Laplacian to enhance spectral GNN architectures,
    achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks.


    Additionally, I have investigated the challenges of node clustering in directed
    networks, proposing innovative methods that leverage directionality as a key signal
    rather than a nuisance. My work emphasizes the importance of uncertainty quantification
    in stock price forecasting using Bayesian neural networks, particularly during
    volatile periods like the COVID-19 pandemic.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    contributing to the advancement of GNN methodologies and their deployment in real-world
    scenarios.'

    machine learning, and statistical modeling. My recent work has focused on innovative
    methods for graph generation, particularly through my development of SteinGen,
    which leverages Stein''s method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to generate
    high-quality graph samples from limited data. I have also explored the dynamics
    of brain states under deep anesthesia using fMRI data, revealing insights into
    functional complexity and modular organization.


    My research extends to the theoretical underpinnings of graph neural networks
    (GNNs), where I have derived novel bounds on generalization error in over-parameterized
    regimes, enhancing our understanding of their performance. I have contributed
    to scalable graph representation learning with the L2G2G method, which improves
    accuracy without sacrificing efficiency.


    In addition, I have developed tools for assessing the quality of synthetic data
    generators, such as AgraSSt, which provides a principled approach to evaluate
    graph generators. My work on signed and directed networks has culminated in the
    creation of PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed, a comprehensive software package
    that facilitates research in this area.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,

    of bilevel optimization to graph learning, culminating in the development of BloomGML,
    which recasts various graph learning methods as special cases of this framework.
    This approach not only enhances the flexibility of energy functions in graph neural
    networks (GNNs) but also bridges connections with non-GNN-based methods, such
    as knowledge graph embeddings and label propagation.


    In addition to my work on graph learning, I have explored the challenges of aligning
    large language models with human preferences through direct preference optimization
    (DPO). My research identifies critical shortcomings in existing DPO methods and
    proposes a novel loss function that addresses these limitations, supported by
    empirical results.


    Recognizing the gap in predictive modeling for relational databases (RDBs), I
    have also developed 4DBInfer, an open-source toolbox that facilitates the conversion
    of multi-table datasets into graph representations while preserving their tabular
    characteristics. This work aims to establish public benchmarks for RDBs, enabling
    more effective comparisons and advancements in predictive modeling.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization\
    \ problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set\
    \ of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their\
    \ offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization,\
    \ phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the\
    \ problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate\
    \ kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group\
    \ assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline.\
    \ To show the effect of a linear combination of LcycleandLupset, we empirically\
    \ test Lcycle`τLupset, withτvarying from 0 to 0.9; see Fig. 33 (the others are\
    \ omitted but could lead to the sameresults for η“0.9as in general allexperiments\
    \ also show that as the problem becomes harder (e.g. as the noise level increases\
    \ and the network becomes sparser), a smaller coefficient of Lupset(even zero)\
    \ is preferred, which indicates that Lcycleplays a more essential role in the\
    \ more challenging scenarios. To assess the effect of fine-tuning (via projected\
    \ gradient steps) over the baselines, we apply the same number of projected gradient\
    \ descent steps as GNNSync to the comparative baselines and report the performance\
    \ in Figures 34 and 35. We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps,\
    \ the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline.\
