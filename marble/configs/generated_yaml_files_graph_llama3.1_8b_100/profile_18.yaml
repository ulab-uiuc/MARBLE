  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in computer vision, particularly in the
    areas of object detection and point cloud analysis. My recent work has focused
    on addressing the unique challenges posed by drone-captured scenarios, where I
    developed TPH-YOLOv5, an enhanced version of the YOLOv5 architecture. This model
    incorporates Transformer Prediction Heads and attention mechanisms to improve
    object detection performance in dynamic environments, achieving notable results
    on the VisDrone2021 dataset.


    In addition to drone applications, I have explored the potential of large-scale
    Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models for scene text detection
    and spotting tasks. My FastTCM-CR50 backbone leverages visual prompt learning
    and cross-attention to refine text regions, demonstrating significant performance
    improvements and robust few-shot training capabilities.


    I am also passionate about advancing point cloud analysis through parameter-efficient
    transfer learning. My work on Dynamic Adapter and Prompt Tuning (DAPT) has shown
    that we can achieve high performance while drastically reducing the number of
    trainable parameters and computational costs.


    Most recently, I introduced PointMamba, a linear complexity model that adapts
    the Mamba architecture for point cloud tasks, showcasing the potential of state
    space models in 3D vision. My research aims to push the boundaries of what is
    possible in computer vision, making advanced techniques more accessible and efficient
    for real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring innovative methodologies in gaze
    estimation and photonic systems. My recent work, Multi-Clue Gaze (MCGaze), introduces
    a novel approach to video gaze estimation by capturing the spatial-temporal interactions
    among head, face, and eye features in an end-to-end learning framework. This method
    allows for joint localization of these clues, enhancing gaze accuracy while maintaining
    high efficiency. The results from experiments on the challenging Gaze360 dataset
    demonstrate the effectiveness of MCGaze, and I am excited to share the source
    code to foster further research in this area.


    In addition to gaze estimation, I have delved into the realm of quantum physics
    and topological photonics, particularly focusing on the concept of synthetic dimensions.
    My work on the photonic Galton board (PGB) showcases how synthetic dimensions
    can transform complex technical challenges in photonic systems. By converting
    temporal high-speed issues into spatial problems, we achieved unprecedented waveform
    generation rates, breaking speed limits in physical systems. This research opens
    new avenues for applications in super-resolution imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy,
    and time measurement.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications,
    pushing the boundaries of what is possible in both gaze estimation and photonic
    technologies.'

    and machine learning, with a particular focus on crowd analysis, object detection,
    and multimodal learning. My recent work has centered on innovative approaches
    to crowd localization, where I developed the Focal Inverse Distance Transform
    (FIDT) map, significantly improving localization accuracy in dense scenes. I also
    introduced the Crowd Localization Transformer (CLTR), which redefines crowd localization
    as a direct set prediction problem, achieving state-of-the-art results across
    multiple datasets.


    In addition to crowd counting, I have explored semi-supervised and unsupervised
    learning frameworks, such as CrowdCLIP, which leverages vision-language models
    for effective counting without extensive annotations. My research extends to 3D
    object detection, where I proposed a unified framework, UniSeg3D, that integrates
    multiple segmentation tasks into a single model, enhancing scene understanding
    through inter-task knowledge sharing.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Increased scale is\
    \ one of the key factors boosting performance in deep learning [1, 2, 3]. However,\
    \ as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable\
    \ slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that\
    \ decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture\
    \ of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as\
    \ dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs,\
    \ MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens.\
    \ This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs\
    \ means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does\
    \ not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization\
    \ strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective\
    \ matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby\
    \ maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements\
    \ have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12,\
    \ 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges\
    \ primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which\
    \ benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities\
    \ like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\\
    sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized\
    \ weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours\
    \ and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting\
    \ MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research\
    \ aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging\
    \ the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate\
    \ whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence\
    \ speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.   Figure 1:  (a) Our MoE Jetpack converts\
    \ pre-trained dense models into MoE models, enhancing convergence and performance\
    \ while maintaining equivalent FLOPs. Here, Exp. represents individual experts,\
    \ E\U0001D438Eitalic_E denotes the number of experts, and L\U0001D43FLitalic_L\
    \ indicates the total number of layers. (b) Performance comparison of ViT trained\
    \ from scratch, pre-trained ViT, Soft MoE [6] trained from scratch, and MoE Jetpack\
    \ across various datasets. MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.\
    \    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained\
    \ dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack\
    \ leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance\
    \ and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint\
    \ recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse\
    \ upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct\
    \ experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple\
    \ weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results\
    \ in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical\
    \ adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture\
    \ for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance.\
    \ Existing MoE architectures, such as Switch Transformers [4] and Soft MoE [6],\
    \ are not designed to leverage pre-existing dense checkpoints, which may lead\
    \ to optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning. The SpheroMoE\
    \ layer mitigates these challenges by normalized token mixing, expert regularization,\
    \ and adaptive dual-path.   By equipping dense checkpoints with\n\n          \
