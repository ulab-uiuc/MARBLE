    machine learning and data protection. My recent work focuses on the intersection
    of differentially private methods and generative models, particularly in enhancing
    image generation through the effective use of large-scale public data. I have
    developed novel frameworks for deep unlearning in large language models, addressing
    the complexities of removing interrelated facts while maintaining model performance.


    My research also delves into the vulnerabilities of machine learning systems,
    such as gradient inversion attacks in federated learning and the challenges posed

    (Large Scale Washing) for knowledge unlearning in language models, ensuring that
    models can forget sensitive information without sacrificing their reasoning capabilities.


    Additionally, I explore the dynamics of machine learning systems, revealing how
    improvements in one model can inadvertently degrade the performance of others
    due to entanglement. My work aims to provide robust solutions to these challenges,
    including developing more resilient paper bidding systems for academic conferences
    and addressing the privacy risks in multi-party data sharing.

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the study of electrical Lie algebras
    of finite Dynkin type, a fascinating area that intersects algebra and combinatorial
    structures in the context of circular planar electrical networks. My work builds
    on the foundational contributions of Lam-Pylyavskyy, who introduced these Lie
    algebras, and I have focused on proving his conjecture regarding their dimensions
    across all classical Dynkin types—namely, A, B, C, and D.


    Through my research, I have not only confirmed this conjecture but also provided
    a detailed description of the structure of these electrical Lie algebras. My findings
    reveal that they can be understood as the semisimple product of the symplectic
    Lie algebra with its finite-dimensional irreducible representations. This work
    not only advances our understanding of the algebraic structures involved but also
    connects to broader applications in combinatorial operations on electrical networks,
    as explored by Curtis-Ingerman-Morrow and Colin de Verdière-Gitler-Vertigan.


    I am passionate about uncovering the intricate relationships between algebraic
    concepts and their applications in real-world systems, and I look forward to further
    exploring the implications of my findings in both theoretical and applied mathematics.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The effectiveness\
    \ of most supervised learning models relies on a key assumption that the training\
    \ data and test data share the same distribution. However, this assumption rarely\
    \ holds in real-world scenarios, leading to the phenomenon of distribution shift (Quiñonero-Candela\
    \ et al., 2009; Amodei et al., 2016). Previous research has primarily focused\
    \ on understanding distribution shifts in offline or batch settings, where a single\
    \ shift occurs between the training and test distributions (Lin et al., 2002;\
    \ Shimodaira, 2000; Zadrozny, 2004; Zhang et al., 2013; Lipton et al., 2018).\
    \ In contrast, real-world applications often involve test data arriving in an\
    \ online fashion, and the distribution shift can continuously evolve over time.\
    \ Additionally, there is another challenging issue of missing and delayed feedback\
    \ labels, stemming from the online setup, where gathering labels for the streaming\
    \ data in a timely manner becomes a challenging task.   To tackle the distribution\
    \ shift problem, prior work often relies on additional assumptions regarding the\
    \ nature of the shift, such as label shift or covariate shift (Schölkopf et al.,\
    \ 2012). In this paper, we focus on the common (generalized) label shift problem\
    \ in an online setting with missing labels (Wu et al., 2021) . Specifically, the\
    \ learner is given a fixed set of labeled training data D0∼\U0001D4ABtrainsimilar-tosubscript\U0001D437\

    \ data St∼\U0001D4ABttestsimilar-tosubscript\U0001D446\U0001D461subscriptsuperscript\U0001D4AB\

    \ italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∼ caligraphic_P start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_test\
    \ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT arrives in\
    \ an online fashion (t=1,2,⋯\U0001D46112⋯t=1,2,\\cdotsitalic_t = 1 , 2 , ⋯). For\
    \ the online label shift, we assume the label distribution \U0001D4ABttest⁢(y)subscriptsuperscript\U0001D4AB\
    test\U0001D461\U0001D466\\mathcal{P}^{\\rm test}_{t}(y)caligraphic_P start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ roman_test end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ ( italic_y ) may change over time t\U0001D461titalic_t while the conditional\
    \ distribution remains the same, i.e. \U0001D4ABttest⁢(x|y)=\U0001D4ABtrain⁢(x|y)subscriptsuperscript\U0001D4AB\
    test\U0001D461conditional\U0001D465\U0001D466superscript\U0001D4ABtrainconditional\U0001D465\
    \U0001D466\\mathcal{P}^{\\rm test}_{t}(x|y)=\\mathcal{P}^{\\rm train}(x|y)caligraphic_P\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_test end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t\
    \ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_y ) = caligraphic_P start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ roman_train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_y ). For example, employing\
    \ MRI image classifiers for concussion detection becomes challenging as label\
    \ shifts emerge from seasonal variations in the image distribution. A classifier\
    \ trained during skiing season may perform poorly when tested later, given the\
    \ continuous change in image distribution between skiing and non-skiing seasons.\
    \ In contrast to label shift, the generalized label shift relaxes the assumption\
    \ of an unchanged conditional distribution on x\U0001D465xitalic_x given y\U0001D466\
    yitalic_y. Instead, it assumes that there exists a transformation hℎhitalic_h\
    \ of the covariate, such that the conditional distribution \U0001D4ABttest⁢(h⁢(x)|y)=\U0001D4AB\
    train⁢(h⁢(x)|y)subscriptsuperscript\U0001D4ABtest\U0001D461conditionalℎ\U0001D465\

    rm test}_{t}(h(x)|y)=\\mathcal{P}^{\\rm train}(h(x)|y)caligraphic_P start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ roman_test end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ ( italic_h ( italic_x ) | italic_y ) = caligraphic_P start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_train\
    \ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_h ( italic_x ) | italic_y ) stays the same. Reiterating\
    \ our example, consider an MRI image classifier that undergoes training and testing\
    \ at different clinics, each equipped with MRI machines of varying hardware and\
    \ software versions. As a result, the images may display disparities in brightness,\
    \ resolution, and other characteristics. However, a feature extractor hℎhitalic_h\
    \ exists, capable of mapping these variations to the same point in the transformed\
    \ feature space, such that the conditional distribution \U0001D4AB⁢(h⁢(x)|y)\U0001D4AB\
    conditionalℎ\U0001D465\U0001D466\\mathcal{P}(h(x)|y)caligraphic_P ( italic_h (\
    \ italic_x ) | italic_y ) remains the same. In both settings, the goal of the\
    \ learner is to adapt to the\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
