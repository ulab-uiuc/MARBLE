    \ (OCO) stands as a pivotal online learning framework for modeling many real-world\
    \ sequential predictions and decision-making problems (Hazan, 2016). OCO is commonly\
    \ formulated as a repeated game between the learner and the environment with the\
    \ following protocol. In each round t∈[T]\U0001D461delimited-[]\U0001D447t\\in[T]italic_t\
    \ ∈ [ italic_T ], the learner chooses a decision \U0001D431tsubscript\U0001D431\
    \U0001D461\\mathbf{x}_{t}bold_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\

    mathbf{x}_{t})italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x\

    \ The goal of the learner is to minimize the cumulative loss over T\U0001D447\

    \ the difference between the cumulative loss of the online learner and that of\
    \ the best decision chosen in hindsight.   Although there are plenty of algorithms\
    \ to minimize the regret of convex functions, including general convex, exponentially\
    \ concave (abbr. exp-concave) and strongly convex functions (Zinkevich, 2003;\
    \ Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007; Hazan et al., 2007), most of them can only handle\
    \ one specific function type, and need to estimate the moduli of strong convexity\
    \ and exp-concavity. The demand for prior knowledge regarding function types motivates\
    \ the development of universal algorithms for OCO, which aim to attain minimax\
    \ optimal regret guarantees for multiple types of convex functions simultaneously (Bartlett\
    \ et al., 2008; van Erven and Koolen, 2016; Wang et al., 2019; Mhammedi et al.,\
    \ 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023). State-of-the-art methods typically\
    \ adopt a two-layer structure following the prediction with expert advice (PEA)\
    \ framework (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006). More specifically, they maintain\
    \ O⁢(log⁡T)\U0001D442\U0001D447O(\\log T)italic_O ( roman_log italic_T ) expert-algorithms\
    \ with different configurations to handle the uncertainty of functions and deploy\
    \ a meta-algorithm to track the best one. While this two-layer framework has demonstrated\
    \ effectiveness in endowing algorithms with universality, it raises concerns regarding\
    \ the computational efficiency. Since each expert-algorithm needs to execute one\
    \ projection onto the feasible domain \U0001D4B3\U0001D4B3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X\
    \ per round, standard universal algorithms perform O⁢(log⁡T)\U0001D442\U0001D447\
    O(\\log T)italic_O ( roman_log italic_T ) projections in each round, which can\
    \ be time-consuming in practical scenarios particularly when projecting onto some\
    \ complicated domains.   In the literature, there exists an effort to reduce the\
    \ number of projections required by universal algorithms tailored for exp-concave\
    \ functions (Mhammedi et al., 2019). This is achieved by applying the black-box\
    \ reduction of (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018), which reduces an OCO problem on the\
    \ original (but can be complicated) feasible domain to a more manageable one on\
    \ a simpler domain, such as an Euclidean ball. Deploying an existing universal\
    \ algorithm (van Erven and Koolen, 2016) on the reduced problem enables us to\
    \ attain optimal regret for\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
