  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in advanced techniques for image generation
    and representation learning, particularly focusing on diffusion models and novel
    view synthesis. My recent work has explored the intricacies of guided diffusion,
    where I identified challenges in accelerating the sampling process and proposed
    operator splitting methods to enhance efficiency. This innovation allows for high-quality
    image generation with significantly reduced sampling time, applicable across various
    conditional generation tasks such as text-to-image synthesis and super-resolution.


    In addition, I developed NeX, a cutting-edge approach to novel view synthesis
    that leverages multiplane images (MPI) to achieve real-time rendering of complex
    view-dependent effects. By parameterizing pixels with neural network-learned basis
    functions, NeX outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and speed, even
    in challenging scenarios like rainbow reflections.


    My research also delves into the potential of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
    for representation learning. I introduced a two-part latent encoding system that
    captures both high-level semantics and stochastic variations, enabling applications
    like attribute manipulation and improved denoising efficiency. My work aims to
    bridge the gap between generative models and practical applications, pushing the
    boundaries of what is possible in image synthesis and representation. For more
    details on my projects, please visit my research pages.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing lighting estimation techniques
    in computer vision, particularly through the innovative use of diffusion models.
    My recent work addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on HDR
    panorama datasets, which often falter in real-world, uncontrolled environments
    due to their restricted diversity and size. By leveraging diffusion models trained
    on billions of standard images, I have developed a straightforward yet effective
    approach to render chrome balls within input images, a task that presents unique
    challenges.


    My research has revealed a fascinating relationship between the appearance of
    chrome balls and the initial diffusion noise map, which I exploit to generate
    high-quality chrome balls consistently. Additionally, I have fine-tuned an LDR
    diffusion model, specifically Stable Diffusion XL, using LoRA to enable exposure
    bracketing for HDR light estimation. This work not only produces convincing light
    estimates across a variety of settings but also demonstrates remarkable generalization
    capabilities in real-world scenarios. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries
    of lighting estimation and contributing to advancements in the field of computer
    vision.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in computer graphics and machine learning,
    with a focus on rendering techniques, light estimation, and character modeling.
    My recent work has led to innovative methods for estimating lighting from single
    images using diffusion models, which significantly enhance the generalization
    of light estimation in uncontrolled environments. I also contributed to the development
    of Talking Head Anime 3 (THA3), an open-source project that enables real-time
    control of anime character models from single images, improving both image quality
    and processing speed.


    In addition to character modeling, I have explored the intricate physics of light
    scattering in hair, developing a new scattering model for elliptical fibers that
    provides a more accurate representation of hair appearance. My research extends
    to fabric rendering, where I introduced a fast precomputation-based algorithm
    that achieves high visual quality while significantly reducing rendering times
    compared to traditional methods.


    I am passionate about bridging the gap between synthetic data generation and real-world
    applications, as demonstrated in my work on 2D pose estimation for anime characters.
    By leveraging 3D character models to create synthetic training data, I have shown
    that high-performing pose estimators can be developed even with limited real-world
    datasets.


    Overall, my research aims to push the boundaries of visual realism and interactivity
    in digital media, making advanced techniques accessible for practical applications
    in gaming, animation, and beyond.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of 3D shape reconstruction,
    neural rendering, and generative modeling. My recent work includes the development
    of ARTIC3D, a self-supervised framework that reconstructs high-fidelity 3D shapes
    from sparse image collections, leveraging diffusion models to enhance image quality
    and detail. I also introduced the Lighting-Aware Neural Field (LANe), which enables
    compositional synthesis of driving scenes while accounting for lighting variations,
    showcasing my commitment to creating realistic and dynamic visual representations.


    In addition to 3D modeling, I have explored the intersection of music and motion
    through a novel approach that generates dance sequences synchronized with music,
    achieving state-of-the-art results in this domain. My work on DreamBooth3D allows
    for personalized 3D asset generation from minimal input images, demonstrating
    my focus on user-centric applications in 3D modeling.

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of computer vision
    and machine learning, with a particular focus on integrating visual and textual
    information. My recent work has centered around Visual Question Answering (VQA),
    where I introduced the SEA-VQA dataset to address the cultural gaps in existing
    models, particularly in Southeast Asia. This project highlighted the importance
    of cultural specificity in VQA systems and revealed significant performance drops
    in current models when faced with culturally rich content.


    In addition to VQA, I have explored innovative techniques for image processing,
    such as single-view face relighting and lighting estimation using diffusion models.
    My approach to face relighting bypasses traditional assumptions about lighting
    and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art results in challenging real-world scenarios.
    I also developed methods for enhancing 2D scene understanding through geometric-aware
    alignment with CAD models, demonstrating the versatility of lightweight 3D data.


    My research extends to novel applications of deep learning, including motion synthesis
    and object localization using millimeter-wave radar. I have pioneered methods
    like Guided Motion Diffusion and Diffusion Noise Optimization, which leverage
    existing models for various motion-related tasks without the need for extensive
    retraining.
