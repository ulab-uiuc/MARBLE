    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Tensor decomposition\
    \ methods have recently found numerous applications in machine learning. Their\
    \ ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes\
    \ them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they\
    \ have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013,\
    \ Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov\
    \ et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al.,\
    \ 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most\
    \ popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock,\
    \ 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition\
    \ grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R\U0001D445\
    Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar\
    \ and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets,\
    \ 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number\
    \ of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable\
    \ algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature\
    \ of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition\
    \ is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N\U0001D441\
    Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor \U0001D4B3\U0001D4B3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is\
    \ the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values\
    \ decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in\
    \ a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of \U0001D4B3\
    \U0001D4B3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N\U0001D441Nitalic_N.\
    \ Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012]\
    \ to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of\
    \ ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the\
    \ workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational\
    \ cost is still exponential in N\U0001D441Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires\
    \ solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of \U0001D4B3\U0001D4B3\\\
    mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives\
    \ based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the\
    \ TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact\
    \ singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko\
    \ et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach\
    \ have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized\
    \ variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.  \
    \ Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach\
    \ to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling,\
    \ we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem\
    \ while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of\
    \ rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact\
    \ leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each\
    \ iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient\
    \ TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling.\
    \ We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors\
    \ showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\\times× speed-up compared to its\
    \ non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.   Our core contribution\
    \ is the following theorem, which shows that we can efficiently compute a\n\n\
