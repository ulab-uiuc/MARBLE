  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Diffusion models\
    \ [24, 60, 62] have shown exceptional performance in image generation [54], thereby\
    \ inspiring their application in the field of image editing [6, 22, 7, 50, 64,\
    \ 21]. These approaches typically leverage a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) stable\
    \ diffusion model [54], using DDIM [61] inversion to transform source images into\
    \ noise, which is then progressively denoised under the guidance of a prompt to\
    \ generate the edited image.   Despite satisfactory performance in image editing,\
    \ achieving high-quality video editing remains challenging. Specifically, unlike\
    \ the well-established open-source T2I stable diffusion models [54], comparable\
    \ T2V diffusion models are not as mature due to the difficulty of modeling complicated\
    \ temporal motions, and training a T2V model from scratch demands substantial\
    \ computational resources [23, 26, 59]. Consequently, there is a growing focus\
    \ on adapting the pre-trained T2I diffusion for video editing [14, 30, 10, 69,\
    \ 70, 51]. In this case, maintaining temporal consistency in edited videos is\
    \ one of the biggest challenges, which requires the generated frames to be stylistically\
    \ coherent and exhibit smooth temporal transitions, rather than appearing as a\
    \ series of independent images. Numerous methods have been working on this topic\
    \ while still facing various limitations, such as the inability to ensure fine-grained\
    \ temporal consistency (leading to flickering [30, 51] or blurring [14] in generated\
    \ videos), requiring additional components [27, 69, 10, 70] or needing extra training\
    \ or optimization [70, 66, 38], etc.   Figure 2: Comparison between COVE (our\
    \ method) and previous methods[10, 70].   In this work, our goal is to achieve\
    \ highly consistent video editing by leveraging the intra-frame correspondence\
    \ relationship among tokens, which is intuitively closely related to the temporal\
    \ consistency of videos: If corresponding tokens across frames exhibit high similarity,\
    \ the resulting video will thus demonstrate high temporal consistency. Taking\
    \ a video of a man as an example, if the token representing his nose has high\
    \ similarity across frames, his nose will be unlikely to deform or flicker throughout\
    \ the video. However, how to obtain accurate correspondence information among\
    \ tokens is still largely under-explored in existing works, although the intrinsic\
    \ characteristic of the video editing task (i.e., the source video and edited\
    \ video are expected to share similar motion and semantic layout) determines that\
    \ it naturally exists in the source video. Some previous methods [10, 70] leverage\
    \ a pre-trained optical-flow model to obtain the flowing trajectory of each token\
    \ across frames, which can be seen as a kind of coarse correspondence information.\
    \ Despite the self-attention among tokens in the same trajectory can enhance the\
    \ temporal consistency of the edited video, it still encounters two primary limitations:\
    \ Firstly, these methods heavily rely on a highly accurate pre-trained optical-flow\
    \ model to obtain the correspondence relationship of tokens, which is not available\
    \ in many scenarios [29]. Secondly, supposing we have access to an extremely accurate\
    \ optical-flow model, it is still only able to obtain the coarse one-to-one correspondence\
    \ among tokens in different frames (Figure 2a), which would lead to the loss of\
    \ information because one token is highly likely to correspond to multiple tokens\
    \ in other frames in most cases (Figure 2b).   Addressing these problems, we notice\
    \ that the inherent diffusion\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
