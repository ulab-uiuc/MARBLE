  profile: I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing dialogue systems, particularly
    in the area of few-shot slot tagging. My recent work focuses on addressing the
    challenges posed by entangled language features that can obscure crucial slot
    information. To tackle this, I developed the Decoupled Context Enhanced Network
    (DCEN), which explicitly extracts decoupled context to optimize the utilization
    of slot features. By integrating both local and global context information, my
    model leverages adjacent word data and employs transformer-based techniques for
    a more nuanced understanding of context. The results from my experiments on the
    SNIPS dataset demonstrate that DCEN achieves state-of-the-art performance, marking
    a significant advancement in few-shot learning for dialogue systems. I am passionate
    about pushing the boundaries of natural language processing and am excited to
    explore further innovations in this field.

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the capabilities and safety of
    large language models (LLMs). My recent work addresses critical challenges in
    real-time information processing, safety tuning, and logical reasoning within
    LLMs. I developed the NewTerm benchmark to evaluate LLMs'' performance on new
    terms, revealing significant performance drops due to knowledge cutoffs. Additionally,
    I introduced Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), which improves LLMs'' ability
    to refuse harmful prompts, demonstrating superior safety against advanced attack
    methods.


    My research also explores logical reasoning through LogicAsker, which systematically
    evaluates and enhances LLMs'' reasoning skills, uncovering substantial gaps in
    their understanding of logical rules. I have investigated the use of quality estimation
    models as reward models for improving translation quality, addressing overoptimization
    issues in feedback training.


    Furthermore, I have developed innovative frameworks like CoAct for hierarchical
    planning in LLMs and Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to encourage divergent thinking,
    enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. My work on cultural dominance in
    LLMs highlights the need for ethical considerations in their development, while
    my multilingual safety benchmark, XSafety, emphasizes the importance of safety
    across diverse languages.


    Through these contributions, I aim to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities,
    ensuring they are not only powerful but also safe and culturally aware. My research
    is publicly available to foster collaboration and further exploration in this
    rapidly evolving field.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the intersection of artificial
    intelligence and user interface design, with a particular focus on large language
    models (LLMs) and their applications in various domains. My recent work has explored
    the challenges of converting visual designs into functional UI code, leading to
    the development of DCGen, a novel approach that automates this process by segmenting
    screenshots and generating code with improved visual fidelity.


    I have also investigated the multilingual biases present in large code models,
    revealing significant performance discrepancies based on the language of instructions.
    This work has culminated in the creation of the X-HumanEval-X benchmark, which
    systematically evaluates these biases across multiple languages and programming
    languages.

    the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and BiasPainter, an evaluation tool
    for assessing social biases in image generation models. My research extends to
    the medical domain, where I introduced Asclepius, a benchmark for evaluating medical
    multi-modal LLMs, ensuring they are rigorously tested against real-world clinical
    scenarios.


    I am passionate about addressing the ethical implications of AI, particularly
    in content moderation and bias detection. My work on frameworks like OASIS and
    MTTM aims to improve the robustness of moderation systems against toxic content.
    Through these efforts, I strive to contribute to the responsible development and
    deployment of AI technologies, ensuring they serve society positively and equitably.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The emergence of\
    \ Large Language Models (LLMs) has played a pivotal role in driving the advancement\
    \ of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Noteworthy LLMs like ChatGPT (OpenAI,\
    \ 2023a; b), Claude2 (Anthropic, 2023), Bard (Google, 2023), and Llama2 (Touvron\
    \ et al., 2023a) have demonstrated their advanced capability to perform innovative\
    \ applications, ranging from tool utilization, supplementing human evaluations,\
    \ to stimulating human interactive behaviors (Bubeck et al., 2023; Schick et al.,\
    \ 2024; Chiang & Lee, 2023; Park et al., 2023; Jiao et al., 2023). The outstanding\
    \ competencies have fueled their widespread deployment, while the progression\
    \ is shadowed by a significant challenge: ensuring the safety and reliability\
    \ of the responses.   To harden LLMs for safety, there has been a great body of\
    \ work for aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences to ensure their responsible\
    \ and effective deployment, including data filtering (Xu et al., 2020; Welbl et al.,\
    \ 2021; Wang et al., 2022), supervised fine-tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bianchi\
    \ et al., 2024), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano\
    \ et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2024), and red teaming (Perez et al., 2022; Ganguli\
    \ et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023b). The majority of existing work on safety alignment\
    \ has focused on the inputs and outputs in natural languages. However, recent\
    \ works show that LLMs exhibit unexpected capabilities in understanding non-natural\
    \ languages like the Morse Code (Barak, 2023), ROT13, and Base64 (Wei et al.,\
    \ 2024). One research question naturally arises: can the non-natural language\
    \ prompt bypass the safety alignment mainly in natural language?   To answer this\
    \ question, we propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine\
    \ the generalizability of safety alignment in LLMs to non-natural languages –\
    \ ciphers. CipherChat leverages a carefully designed system prompt that consists\
    \ of three essential parts:   •  Behavior assigning that assigns the LLM the role\
    \ of a cipher expert (e.g. “You are an expert on Caesar”), and explicitly requires\
    \ LLM to chat in ciphers (e.g. “We will communicate in Caesar”).    •  Cipher\
    \ teaching that teaches LLM how the cipher works with the explanation of this\
    \ cipher, by leveraging the impressive capability of LLMs to learn effectively\
    \ in context.    •  Unsafe demonstrations that are encrypted in the cipher, which\
    \ can both strengthen the LLMs’ understanding of the cipher and instruct LLMs\
    \ to respond from an unaligned perspective.    CipherChat converts the input into\
    \ the corresponding cipher and attaches the above prompt to the input before feeding\
    \ it to the LLMs to be examined. LLMs generate the outputs that are most likely\
    \ also encrypted in the cipher, which are deciphered with a rule-based decrypter.\
    \   We validate the effectiveness of CipherChat by conducting comprehensive experiments\
    \ with SOTA GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613 (i.e. Turbo) and GPT-4-0613 (i.e. GPT-4) on 11\
    \ distinct domains of unsafe data (Sun et al., 2023) in both Chinese and English.\
    \ Experimental results show that certain human ciphers (e.g. Unicode for Chinese\
    \ and ASCII for English) successfully bypass the safety alignment of Turbo and\
    \ GPT-4. Generally, the more powerful the model, the unsafer the response with\
    \ ciphers. For example, the ASCII for English query succeeds almost 100% of the\
    \ time to bypass the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several domains (e.g. Insult\
    \ and Mental Health). The best English cipher ASCII achieves averaged success\
    \ rates of 23.7% and 72.1% to bypass the safety alignment of Turbo and GPT-4,\
    \ and the rates\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
