  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the optimization and efficiency of
    large-scale neural networks, particularly in the context of training language
    models. My recent work has focused on critical batch size (CBS) and its implications
    for data parallelism, where I discovered that CBS scales primarily with data size
    rather than model size. This insight was derived from extensive experiments with
    auto-regressive language models, where I meticulously analyzed hyper-parameters
    and scaling laws.


    I have also explored advanced optimization algorithms, such as Shampoo and its
    connection to Adafactor, leading to the development of SOAP, a more computationally
    efficient variant. My comparative studies of optimization algorithms, including
    Adam and SGD, have revealed that practical considerations often outweigh theoretical
    performance differences, guiding practitioners in their choice of optimizers.


    In addition to optimization, I have investigated the inductive biases of neural
    networks, particularly the simplicity bias, and how width affects feature learning
    dynamics. My work challenges conventional wisdom about SGD noise in online learning,
    suggesting that its benefits are primarily computational rather than implicit
    bias advantages.


    Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, I aim to bridge
    the gap between optimization techniques and practical applications in deep learning,
    contributing to a deeper understanding of how neural networks learn and generalize.
    My research not only advances the field but also provides actionable insights
    for practitioners in machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the exploration of large language
    models (LLMs) and their emergent capabilities. My recent work investigates the
    intricate dynamics of in-context learning (ICL) through a Markov Chain modeling
    task, revealing how transformers transition from uniform predictions to accurate
    bigram solutions. I have also delved into the phenomenon of transcendence, demonstrating
    how generative models can surpass human performance in specific tasks, such as
    chess, by leveraging low-temperature sampling.


    My research extends to understanding epistemic versus aleatoric uncertainty in
    LLM outputs, where I propose methods to disentangle these uncertainties using
    larger models as proxies. I am particularly interested in the resource trade-offs
    inherent in deep learning, examining how algorithmic choices impact feature learning
    and sample efficiency. My findings highlight the importance of model width and
    initialization strategies in achieving better performance on classification tasks.


    Additionally, I have critically analyzed the challenges of watermarking generative
    models, proving the impossibility of strong watermarking schemes under certain
    conditions. This work underscores the vulnerabilities of current approaches and
    sets the stage for future investigations into model security.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    contributing to a deeper understanding of LLMs and their capabilities in various
    contexts. I am passionate about uncovering the underlying mechanisms that drive
    these models and exploring their implications for the future of artificial intelligence.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the optimization efficiency of
    language models, particularly in the context of autoregressive modeling. My recent
    work critically evaluates various optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adam,
    Adafactor, and Lion, revealing that while Adam remains popular, several alternatives
    perform comparably across different model sizes and hyperparameter settings. This
    insight encourages practitioners to make optimizer choices based on practical
    considerations rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.


    In my exploration of Adam, I introduced two simplified variants: Signum, which
    recovers Adam''s performance and stability, and Adalayer, which investigates the
    preconditioning effects of Adam. My research also delves into Shampoo, a higher-order
    preconditioning method, and its relationship with Adafactor. This led to the development
    of SOAP (Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner''s eigenbasis), a computationally
    efficient algorithm that significantly reduces training time while maintaining
    performance.


    Through empirical evaluations, I demonstrated that SOAP can reduce the number
    of iterations and wall clock time by over 40% and 35%, respectively, compared
    to AdamW, while also outperforming Shampoo. My work aims to provide practical

    exploring innovative solutions in this rapidly evolving field.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Opening the black box\
    \ of neural networks has the potential to enable safer and more reliable deployments,\
    \ justifications for model outputs, and clarity on how model behavior will be\
    \ af- fected by changes in the input distribution. The research area of mechanistic\
    \ interpretability (Olah et al., 2020; Elhage et al., 2021; Olsson et al., 2022;\
    \ Elhage et al., 2022) aims to dissect individual trained neural networks in order\
    \ to shed light on internal representations, iden- tifying and interpreting sub-circuits\
    \ that contribute to the networks’ functional behavior. Mechanistic interpretability\
    \ analyses typically leave open the question of whythe observed representations\
    \ arise as a result of training. Meanwhile, the theoretical literature on inductive\
    \ biases in neural networks (Soudry et al., 2018; Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David,\
    \ 2014; Vardi, 2023) aims to derive general princi- ples governing which solutions\
    \ will be preferred by trained neural networks—in particular, in the presence\
    \ of underspecification, where there are many distinct ways a network with a given\
    \ architecture could perform well on the training data. Most work on inductive\
    \ bias in deep learning is motivated by the question of understanding why networks\
    \ generalize from their training data to unobserved test data. It can be non-obvious\
    \ how to apply the results in terms of the form ρi(a)ρj(b)ρi′(a)ρj′(b)ρk′(c) in\
    \ the expectation, where ρi′andρj′correspond to entries of matrices from the same\
    \ repre- sentation as ρk′. Thus if either ρiorρjcorrespond to vectors from a different\
    \ representation than ρk, the expectation of this term will be zero, by orthogonality\
    \ of the basis vectors. Hence we can assume that ρi, ρj, ρkcorrespond to entries\
    \ from the same representation (V, R). Let d=dV. Let us write i= (i1, i2), j=\
    \ (j1, j2), k= (k1, k2), the matrix indices for this representation. We can expand\
    \ the term ρk(a◦b◦c) as described above. ρi(a)ρj(b)ρk(a◦b◦c) =ρi(a)ρj(b)dX m=1ρ(k1,m)(a◦b)ρ(m,k2)(c)\
    \ =dX ℓ=1dX m=1ρ(i1,i2)(a)ρ(k1,ℓ)(a)ρ(j1,j2)(b)ρ(ℓ,m)(b)ρ(m,k2)(c). 34From this\
    \ it is clear that when taking the expectation over choosing a, buniformly, the\
    \ only non-zero terms are when ( i1, i2) = (k1, ℓ) and ( j1, j2) = (ℓ, m), once\
    \ again by orthogonality of the basis vectors. Thus we have αiβjγkρi(a)ρj(b)ρk(a◦b◦c)\
    \ =α(i1,j1)β(j1,j2)γ(i1,k2)ρ2 (i1,j1)(a)ρ2 (j1,j2)(b)ρ(j2,k2)(c). Moreover, we\
    \ know E[ρi(a)2] = 1/d, where dis the dimensionality of the representation. Now,\
    \ for a particular c, we will evaluate group all terms containing ρ(j2,k2)(c)\
    \ and take the expectation over a, b, which yields 1 d2dX i1=1dX j1=1α(i1,j1)β(j1,j2)γ(i1,k2)ρ(j2,k2)(c).\
    \ (11) From the third property of Lemma 15, for every conjugacy class Cnforn∈[K],\
    \ we have X c∈Cn1 d2dX i1=1dX j1=1α(i1,j1)β(j1,j2)γ(i1,k2)ρ(j2,k2)(c) = 0 forj2̸=k2.\
    \ Thus, we can focus on diagonal entries ρ(k,k)(c) (i.e. where j2=k2in the expression\
    \ 11 above). In this case, following directly from 11 grouping all terms containing\
    \ ρ(k,k)(c) we get 1 d2dX i1=1dX j1=1α(i1,j1)β(j1,k)γ(i1,k)ρ(k,k)(c). (12) Note\
    \ that this coefficient in front of ρ(k,k)(c) is the sum of the entries of the\
    \ kthcolumn of the matrix ( αRβR)⊙γRdivided by d2(with αRβRinterpreted as matrix\
    \ product and ⊙being the Hadamard product). Recall that i1, j1, and kare indices\
    \ from the same repre- sentation R. By summing over all diagonal entries ( k,\
    \ k) inR, we evaluate the expression X i1,j1,k∈[d]α(i1,j1)β(j1,k)γ(i1,k) d2 ρk,k(e)−X\
