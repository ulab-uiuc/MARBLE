  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of consciousness,
    quantum mechanics, and advanced machine learning techniques. My work explores
    the intriguing hypothesis that consciousness may play a role in quantum mechanics,
    particularly in the collapse of the wave function. Through empirical testing,
    I have contributed to the discourse surrounding this relationship, ultimately

    neuronal avalanches reflect a state of thermodynamic criticality, which has profound
    implications for understanding brain function. Furthermore, I have advanced variational
    inference techniques through a spline-based nonparametric approach, enhancing
    the flexibility of posterior approximations.

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Recent advances in computer\
    \ and information technology have dramatically boosted the avail- ability of three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) point clouds in many \felds, such as geography, environmental science,\
    \ computer graphics, engineering, economics, and medical imaging. These point\
    \ clouds are usually collections of enormous measurements in space de\fned by\
    \ a given coordinates sys- tem. Sometimes, these point clouds are rendered and\
    \ inspected directly; examples can be found in Rusinkiewicz and Levoy (2000).\
    \ More often, the point clouds are converted to polygon mesh or triangle mesh\
    \ models, e.g., 3D reconstruction is widely used for automated driving vehicles\
    \ (Lee et al., 2016; Shao, 2021). Many e\vorts have been devoted to investigating\
    \ the converting technique, and a survey of surface reconstruction from point\
    \ clouds can be found in Berger Address forcorrespondence: Li Wang, Department\

    \  [stat.CO]  18 Feb 2023et al. (2017). These 3D data typically contain more information\
    \ than the shape of an object, as they represent some meaningful values in real\
    \ life. For example, healthcare professionals can use brain activity levels contained\
    \ in 3D neuroimages to access new angles, resolutions, and details to better understand\
    \ tissue. Another example is using cloud-based 3D scans to explore the location\
    \ and access the grade and type of ore in the mining industry. Despite the potential\
    \ of these applications, there has been limited research on identifying underlying\
    \ signals from 3D solid objects, as there are many challenges in achieving this\
    \ goal. First of all, as shown in the point cloud inputs in Figure 1.2, the shape\
    \ of the point clouds is usually irregular. To extract the underlying signal over\
    \ the irregular-shaped 3D solid object, many conventional results on the consistency\
