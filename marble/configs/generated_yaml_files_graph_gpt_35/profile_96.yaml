    and high-energy physics, with a focus on developing innovative neural network
    architectures that enhance predictive performance while ensuring robustness and
    interpretability. My recent work has introduced novel techniques such as Moment
    Decomposition (MoDe) to improve classifiers for detecting new physics without
    inducing localized structures, and I have explored the application of Wasserstein
    metrics in particle physics through the Energy Mover''s Distance (EMD).


    I am particularly interested in the inductive biases that can be integrated into
    neural networks, such as monotonicity, which is crucial for interpretability and

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Although today’s best\
    \ language models produce impressively cogent, articulate text by learning the\
    \ statistics of language, they still struggle to reliably retrieve information\
    \ seen during training. Models are known to suffer from hallucinations, potentially\
    \ responding with fabricated content that differs from the knowledge present in\
    \ training data. Hallucinations pose a significant hurdle to the adoption of language\
    \ models, especially in domains where reliable knowledge retrieval is paramount\
    \ (Dahl et al., 2024). A well-studied failure mode underlying hallucinations is\
    \ the reversal curse , which ascribes this deficiency to the precise order of\
    \ words presented to the model at train-time (Berglund et al., 2023; Allen-Zhu\
    \ & Li, 2023). For example, a model trained on sentences where Parisalways appears\
    \ as the subject of the sentence, such as “Paris is the capital of France” , can\
    \ be tuned to answer “Paris is the capital of which country?” but not“What is\
    \ the capital of France?” , even though these two formulations encode the same\
    \ underlying information. Existing approaches aimed at mitigating the reversal\
    \ curse have focused on data augmentations that involve training on both the forward\
    \ and reversed tokens (Golovneva et al., 2024). In this work, we focus on learning\
    \ objectives. In Section 2, we propose the factorization curse , a framework that\
    \ characterizes the reversal curse as a failure to model the same joint distribution\
    \ under different factorizations. We show the prevailing left-to-right next token\
    \ prediction, autoregressive (AR) objective used in popular large models such\
    \ as GPT (Radford et al., 2019) and Llama models (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), underlies\
    \ the reversal curse. We illustrate in Figure 1 how the factorization in AR training\
    \ only encodes information based on prior context, thereby limiting how well the\
    \ model can retrieve information based on later context . Through this lens, we\
    \ show the reversal curse is not merely a failure to learn logical implications,\
    \ but a more general problem related to learning objectives. Given this framework,\
    \ we hypothesize in Section 2.1 that factorization agnostic models, i.e., models\
    \ trained in a manner that is less dependent on the specific token order while\
    \ preserving the overall meaning, can store knowledge better and are less prone\
    \ to the reversal curse. To validate our hypothesis and explore 1arXiv:2406.05183v1\

    \ objective does not learn how to predict early tokens from later ones even if\
    \ the information content is the same. The model overfits to a specific factorization\

    \ require reasoning about a different factorization. potential solutions, we conduct\
