    statistical relational AI, and automated reasoning. My work primarily focuses
    on enhancing the capabilities of knowledge graphs through innovative modeling
    techniques and efficient inference methods. I have developed novel approaches
    to knowledge graph completion, such as SimplE, which improves link prediction
    by learning dependent embeddings for entities. My research also explores the integration
    of language models for knowledge extraction, revealing phenomena like Frequency
    Shock that can hinder performance.

    information and the complexities of structured complex task decomposition using
    large language models. I introduced the LAMBADA algorithm for backward chaining
    reasoning, which significantly improves proof-finding efficiency. Additionally,
    I have investigated the trade-offs in training language models on synthetic data,
    demonstrating that weaker models can sometimes yield better results than stronger
    ones in generating training data.

    machine learning, and network theory. My recent work has focused on developing
    innovative methodologies for testing and estimating properties of complex distributions,
    particularly in the context of Markov chains and Ising models. I initiated the
    study of Markov chain testing, proposing efficient testers for identity testing
    of symmetric Markov chains based on a single trajectory, which has significant
    implications for understanding dynamic systems.


    I have also explored the nuances of contrastive learning, revealing the conditions

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance

    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My research doesn''t stop at static graphs; I proposed the ROLAND framework
    to effectively adapt static GNNs for dynamic graphs, enabling real-time updates
    and scalable training.


    In addition to architectural innovations, I have explored the design space of
    GNNs, systematically analyzing over 315,000 configurations to provide guidelines

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning,
    cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. My work primarily focuses on enhancing
    the capabilities of intelligent agents through innovative approaches in hierarchical
    reinforcement learning, language grounding, and meta-learning. Recently, I have
    explored how to leverage human data to inform goal-directed behavior in complex
    environments, demonstrating that using natural language to parameterize sub-goals
    can significantly improve agent performance.


    I am particularly interested in understanding the inductive biases that govern
    how machine learning models generalize, drawing parallels between human cognition
    and artificial systems. My research has revealed that while neural networks often
    exhibit feature-biased and exemplar-based generalization, they can also learn
    abstract rules under certain conditions, akin to human reasoning.


    In addition to my work on generalization, I have investigated the role of causal
    reasoning in reinforcement learning, showing that agents can learn to make causal
    inferences through model-free approaches. I also focus on the interpretability
    of machine learning models, examining how their decision-making processes align
    with human visual perception.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between human-like reasoning and
    machine learning, contributing to the development of more sophisticated AI systems
    that can understand and interact with the world in a human-relevant manner. My
    work not only advances theoretical understanding but also has practical implications
    for building intelligent systems capable of complex reasoning and decision-making.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Large Language Models\
    \ (LLMs) have demonstrated an extraordinary evolution, not only in their output\
    \ quality but also in their burgeoning capabilities. A significant direction of\
    \ development has been models’ ability to perform increasingly general forms of\
    \ reasoning that were previously not possible. The emergence of these novel capabilities\
    \ necessitates the development of robust evaluation benchmarks and metrics to\
    \ measure and enhance model performance in these specific areas.   The ability\
    \ of LLMs to reason over text has improved in leaps and bounds, and has been studied\
    \ extensively (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Rajani et al., 2019).\
    \ More recent developments in multi-modal models has opened up a new space of\
    \ reasoning problems, moving toward the capability to reason across multiple,\
    \ potentially disparate, sources of information presented in various formats (Reid\
    \ et al., 2024; Team et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2024). This\
    \ multi-modal reasoning capability has numerous applications, from complex problem-solving\
    \ to information synthesis. In this paper, we focus on a specific aspect of this\
    \ capability: multi-image reasoning. A large portion of the current benchmarks\
    \ for multi-modal evaluation are based on a single image (Lu et al., 2023, 2022;\
    \ Kazemi et al., 2023a; Lu et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Lindström and Abraham,\
    \ 2022; Fu et al., 2023; Antol et al., 2015; Goyal et al., 2017; Marino et al.,\
    \ 2019). We address the lack of dedicated evaluation frameworks in this domain\
    \ by introducing a comprehensive benchmark designed to specifically assess and\
    \ improve this skill in LLMs.   Figure 1:  Model performances on \U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\
    \U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\\mathsf{ReMI}sansserif_ReMI.\
    \   We focus specifically on reasoning problems where besides visual understanding,\
    \ one needs to find a step-by-step solution to a problem. This process often involves\
    \ combining information across text and multiple images – a skill that is currently\
    \ not extensively evaluated in existing benchmarks. This contribution aims to\
    \ catalyze progress in multi-image reasoning, ultimately enabling LLMs to better\
    \ navigate and extract insights from the increasingly complex information landscape\
    \ of our digital world.   We introduce \U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\
    \U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\\mathsf{ReMI}sansserif_ReMI, a new benchmark\
    \ designed for Reasoning with Multiple Images. Our goal is to cover a broad spectrum\
    \ of domains where integrating information across multiple modalities is necessary,\
    \ as well as various key properties unique to multi-image reasoning. To achieve\
    \ this, we have developed 13 tasks that span a range of domains and properties.\
    \ The domains covered in \U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\
    \U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\\mathsf{ReMI}sansserif_ReMI include algebra, calculus, geometry,\
    \ graph theory, physics, temporal and spatial/maps reasoning, tabular and chart\
    \ understanding, coding, and logic. The properties covered by \U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\
    \U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\\mathsf{ReMI}sansserif_ReMI include\
    \ sequential vs set consumption of image information, problems that require reasoning\
    \ over images demonstrating a similar concept (e.g., two charts) or different\
    \ concepts (e.g., geometry shape and a table), images that are interleaved or\
    \ not interleaved with the text, and the number of separate images provided as\
    \ input. Our tasks require reasoning over up to six images, with all tasks requiring\
    \ reasoning over at least two images. Table 1 outlines the tasks, domains and\
    \ properties. Our images comprise a variety of heterogeneous image types including\
    \ charts, tables, equations, emojis, graphs, shapes, maps, clocks, physical objects,\
    \ LaTeX diagrams, functions, etc.   We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on \U0001D5B1\
    \U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\U0001D5B1\U0001D5BE\U0001D5AC\U0001D5A8\\mathsf{ReMI}sansserif_ReMI and\
    \ compare their performance to humans, showing that model performances remain\
    \ substantially behind human performance (see Fig 1).\n\n            **Your Task**\n\
