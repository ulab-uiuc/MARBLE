  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to the intersection of causal modeling and
    machine learning, with a particular focus on the safety aspects of intelligent
    systems. My recent work addresses a critical challenge in this field: the identification
    of agents within causal models. Recognizing that many existing models often rely
    on unverified assumptions, I have developed the first formal causal definition
    of agents. This definition posits that agents are systems that would alter their
    policies based on the influence of their actions on the world.


    Building on this foundation, I introduced a novel causal discovery algorithm designed
    to identify agents from empirical data, which is a significant advancement in
    understanding how agents operate within complex systems. Additionally, I have
    created algorithms that facilitate the translation between causal models and game-theoretic
    influence diagrams, bridging two important areas of research. My work not only
    clarifies previous confusions stemming from incorrect causal modeling but also
    provides a robust framework for analyzing the safety and behavior of machine learning
    systems. Through my research, I aim to enhance the reliability and interpretability
    of intelligent systems, ensuring they operate safely in real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of causal reasoning
    and game-theoretic reasoning within artificial intelligence. My work addresses
    the critical need for a formal framework that integrates these two domains, leading
    to the development of structural causal games. This innovative approach extends
    existing causal hierarchies and multi-agent influence diagrams, allowing for a
    unified modeling of dependencies in games and facilitating the computation of
    causal queries.


    I am particularly interested in the concept of intention in AI, which underpins
    various aspects of agency and accountability. By operationalizing intention within
    structural causal influence models, I have established a formal definition that
    resonates with philosophical perspectives and can be applied to real-world machine
    learning systems. This work not only clarifies the notion of intent but also enhances
    our understanding of reinforcement learning agents and language models.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the safety analysis of machine learning systems
    by proposing a formal causal definition of agents and developing algorithms for
    causal discovery. My research also addresses the emerging challenges posed by
    generative AI in persuasive contexts, where I aim to systematically study the
    risks and harms associated with AI persuasion. By distinguishing between rational
    and manipulative forms of persuasion, I provide a comprehensive framework for
    understanding and mitigating the potential harms of AI systems in decision-making
    processes.


    Through my research, I strive to advance the theoretical foundations of AI while
    ensuring that these systems are safe, accountable, and beneficial to society.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  What capabilities\
    \ are necessary for general intelligence (Legg & Hutter, 2007)? One candidate\
    \ is causal reasoning, which plays a foundational role in human cognition (Gopnik\
    \ et al., 2007; Sloman & Lagnado, 2015). It has even been argued that human-level\
    \ AI is impossible without causal reasoning (Pearl, 2018). However, recent years\
    \ have seen the development of agents that do not explicitly learn or reason on\
    \ causal models, but nonetheless are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments\
    \ and tasks (Reed et al., 2022; Team et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020).   This\
    \ raises the question, do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt\
    \ to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient? To answer this question,\
    \ we have to be careful not to assume that agents use causal assumptions a priori.\
    \ For example, transportability theory determines what causal knowledge is necessary\
    \ for transfer learning when all assumptions on the data generating process (inductive\
    \ biases) can be expressed as constraints on causal structure (Bareinboim & Pearl,\
    \ 2016). However, deep learning algorithms can exploit a much larger set of inductive\
    \ biases (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Battaglia et al., 2018; Rahaman et al., 2019;\
    \ Goyal & Bengio, 2022) which in many real-world settings may be sufficient to\
    \ identify low regret policies without requiring causal knowledge.   The main\
    \ result of this paper is to answer this question by showing that,  Any agent\
    \ capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of distributional shifts must\
    \ have learned a causal model of the data generating process.    Here, adapting\
    \ to a distributional shift means learning a policy that satisfies a regret bound\
    \ following an intervention on the data generating process—for example, changing\
    \ the distribution of features or latent variables. It is known that a causal\
    \ model of the data generating process can be used to identify regret-bounded\
    \ policies following a distributional shift (sufficiency), with more accurate\
    \ models allowing lower regret policies to be found. We prove the converse (necessity)—given\
    \ regret-bounded policies for a large set of distributional shifts, we can learn\
    \ an approximate causal model of the data generating process, with the approximation\
    \ becoming exact for optimal policies. Hence, learning a causal model of the data\
    \ generating process is necessary for robust adaptation.   This has consequences\
    \ for a number of fields and questions. For one, it implies that causal identification\
    \ laws also constrain domain adaptation. For example, we show that adapting to\
    \ covariate and label shifts is only possible if the causal relations between\
    \ features and labels can be identified from the training data—a non-trivial causal\
    \ discovery problem. This provides further theoretical justification for causal\
    \ representation learning (Schölkopf et al., 2021), showing that learning causal\
    \ representations is necessary for achieving strong robustness guarantees. Our\
    \ result also implies that we can learn causal models from adaptive agents. We\
    \ demonstrate this by solving a causal discovery task on synthetic data by observing\
    \ the policy of a regret-bounded agent under distributional shifts. More speculatively,\
    \ our results suggest that causal models could play a role in emergent capabilities.\
    \ Agents trained to minimise a loss function across many domains are incentivized\
    \ to learn a causal world model, which could in turn enable them to solve a much\
    \ larger set of decision tasks they were not explicitly trained on.   Outline\
