  profile: 'I am a researcher with a keen interest in the intersection of deep learning,
    optimization, and game theory. My recent work has focused on developing innovative
    architectures for hierarchical classification tasks, exemplified by my introduction
    of the lexicographic hybrid deep neural network (LH-DNN). This architecture leverages
    concepts from lexicographic multi-objective optimization and non-standard analysis,
    allowing for efficient classification while significantly reducing learning parameters
    and computational time.


    In addition to my work in deep learning, I have made strides in optimization techniques,
    particularly through the development of the non-Archimedean Interior Point Method
    (NA-IPM). This novel algorithm addresses challenges in managing infeasibility
    and unboundedness in optimization problems, proving to be a robust tool for a
    variety of linear and quadratic programming tasks.


    Furthermore, I have explored the dynamics of the Prisoner''s Dilemma within game
    theory, extending traditional analyses to incorporate infinite and infinitesimal
    payoffs using Sergeyev''s Infinity Computing. This work not only broadens the
    understanding of PD Tournaments but also provides concrete numerical insights
    into their outcomes.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    paving the way for innovative solutions in machine learning and optimization.'

    \ also be noted that the NA-IPM can be used to solve other family of problems\

    To mitigate the issues coming from the iterates divergence, one can resort to\
    \ the embedding described in Equation\n(14), obtaining the strictly feasible and\
    \ bounded problem in (23). Proposition 3 recommends the use of penalizing\nweights\

    \ polyhedron.\nTable 2 reports the iterations made by NA-IPM to solve such an\
    \ extended problem. As expected, the algorithm\nconverges in a finite number of\
    \ steps, and the optimal point lies on the bounding hyperplane \u2212x3\u2212\
    x4\u2212x6=\n\u2212x1\u2212x2\u22123\u2212x6=\u2212\u03B1located infinitely far\
    \ from the origin. Formally, what gives clue about the unboundedness\n20of the\
    \ problem is the dual variable \u03BB3, see Proposition 3. If the problem is bounded\
    \ then it must be zero in the\noptimal solution, while it is equal to 1. In this\
    \ specific case however, there is another and more significant indicator:\nthe\
    \ magnitude of x1andx2. Since the problem was a standard one before the embedding,\
    \ if its solution exists\nit must be finite. In the optimal point found by NA-IPM\
    \ instead, x1andx2are infinite, which tells the user the\noriginal problem was\
    \ unbounded. It may be right to say that, in the current problem, the additional\
    \ constraint\nintroduced by Equation (14) is equivalent to the constraint x1+x2\u2264\
    \u03B1(more precisely to x1+x2\u2264\u03B1\u22123), which\nwould probably have\
    \ been the first choice of anyone at the first look of Figure 3.\nTable 2: Iterations\
