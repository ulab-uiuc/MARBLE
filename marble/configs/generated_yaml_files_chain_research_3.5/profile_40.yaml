  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the
    ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic
    environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML),
    where I introduced FALCON and AutoTransfer to streamline the search for optimal
    model designs across various tasks, significantly reducing computational costs.


    Overall, my goal is to push the boundaries of GNN research, providing scalable
    solutions and insights that can be applied across a wide range of domains, from
    social networks to biological systems. I am passionate about fostering a deeper
    understanding of how graph-based approaches can transform machine learning and
    contribute to solving complex real-world problems.'

    to effectively adapt static GNNs for dynamic graphs, enabling real-time updates
    and scalable training methods.


    In addition to architectural innovations, I have explored the design space of
    GNNs, systematically analyzing over 315,000 configurations to provide guidelines
    for optimal model selection across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly
    with FALCON and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the process of finding effective
    neural architectures by leveraging prior knowledge and enhancing search efficiency.


    Through these contributions, I strive to push the boundaries of what GNNs can
    achieve, fostering a deeper understanding of their structure and performance while
    making them more accessible for real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in fluid dynamics, particularly in the
    analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations and their applications in various physical
    systems. My recent work has focused on proving the global existence of weak solutions
    to the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system, exploring both well-prepared
    and ill-prepared initial data. I have developed methods to establish the long-time
    existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Prandtl system, as well as the global
    regularity of solutions to the 3D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations with axisymmetric
    initial conditions.


    In addition to theoretical advancements, I have conducted first-principles calculations
    to investigate quantum size effects in materials like Mg thin films and have explored
    the behavior of shock-compressed substances, such as oxygen and benzene, using
    quantum molecular dynamics simulations. My research also delves into the intricate
    relationships between spin effects and charge transport in condensed matter systems,
    contributing to our understanding of phenomena like the charge-Hall effect and
    orbital magnetization in complex lattice structures.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical fluid dynamics and

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            Abstract \u2014Efficient data transmission\
    \ across mobile multi-hop\nnetworks that connect edge devices to core servers\
    \ presents\nsignificant challenges, particularly due to the variability in link\n\
    qualities between wireless and wired segments. This variability\nnecessitates\
    \ a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing\
    \ deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle\
    \ at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03B7= 1,9dB is shown\
    \ in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal\
    \ solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second\
    \ method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03BB, the bpp values of the\
    \ random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03B7values\
    \ which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02C6P\u02DCx\u03B7\
    shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout\
    \ this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully\
    \ adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory\
    \ R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded\
    \ weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance\
    \ compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive\
    \ DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models)\
    \ produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive\
    \ h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will\
    \ be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the\
    \ SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig.\
    \ 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018\
    distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC. Fully adaptive\
    \ h-DJSCC framework\nFinally, we introduce the fully adaptive h-DJSCC frame-\n\
    work. We will first discuss the variable rate h-DJSCC frame-\nwork with a fixed\
    \ \u03B7value, inspired by [21]\u2013[23] for image\ncompression. In particular,\
