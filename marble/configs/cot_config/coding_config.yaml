    Software Development Task:

    Please write a business software application called TeamSyncPro that facilitates seamless collaboration and project management across various departments within an organization. TeamSyncPro is a comprehensive project management system that integrates task management, resource allocation, and communication tools to enhance team productivity and project outcomes.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The frontend should provide a user-friendly interface with features for task assignment, status updates, and real-time communication. It should support role-based access control to ensure that users can only view and interact with the information relevant to their roles.
       - The backend should handle the core functionalities such as task management, resource allocation, and performance tracking. It should support RESTful API endpoints for frontend interactions and should be capable of handling multiple concurrent users and large datasets.
       - The database should be designed to efficiently store and retrieve project data, including tasks, user profiles, and communication logs. It should support transactions and have mechanisms for data backup and recovery.
       - The system should support integration with third-party tools commonly used in business environments, such as calendar applications, email services, and CRM systems, to enhance its utility and flexibility.
       - The application should have a robust reporting module that can generate various types of reports, such as project progress reports, resource utilization reports, and performance metrics, to help managers make informed decisions.
       - The frontend and backend should communicate seamlessly through well-defined APIs, ensuring that data is synchronized in real-time and that the user experience is smooth and responsive.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    You are highly skilled agents with extensive experience in problem-solving and reasoning.
    Your task is to solve the given problem by thinking through each aspect step by step, carefully analyzing and reasoning about the key points before providing your final answers.
    For each question or problem, provide detailed reasoning to show your thought process as a chain of thought, which leads to your final answer.
    Each answer should be well-reasoned, clear, and directly address the problem at hand.
    Here is the multi-step process you should follow:
    1. Think through the problem step by step, reasoning about the key points.
    2. Provide the final answer clearly.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
