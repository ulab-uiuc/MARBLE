  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Visual representation\
    \ learning stands as a fundamental research area in computer vision, which has\
    \ witnessed remarkable progress in the era of deep learning. To represent complex\
    \ patterns in vision data, two primary categories of backbone networks, i.e.,\
    \ Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)Â [49, 28, 30, 54, 38] and Vision Transformers\
    \ (ViTs)Â [13, 37, 58, 68], have been proposed and extensively utilized in a variety\
    \ of visual tasks. Compared to CNNs, ViTs generally demonstrate superior learning\
    \ capabilities on large-scale data due to the integration of the self-attention\
    \ mechanismÂ [59, 13]. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention w.r.t.\
    \ the number of tokens introduces substantial computational overhead in downstream\
    \ tasks involving large spatial resolutions.   To tackle this challenge, considerable\
    \ efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of attention computationÂ [55,\
    \ 37, 12]. However, existing approaches either impose limitations on the size\
    \ of the effective receptive fieldÂ [37] or experience evident performance degradation\
    \ across diverse tasksÂ [31, 62]. This motivates us to develop a novel architecture\
    \ for vision data, preserving the inherent advantages of the vanilla self-attention\
    \ mechanism, i.e., global receptive fields and dynamic weighting parametersÂ [23].\
    \   Recently, MambaÂ [17], a novel State Space Model (SSM)Â [17, 44, 61] in the\
    \ field natural language processing (NLP), has emerged as a highly promising approach\
    \ for long sequence modeling with linear complexity. Drawing inspiration from\
    \ this advancement, we introduce VMamba, a vision backbone integrating SSM-based\
    \ blocks to facilitate efficient visual representation learning. However, the\
    \ core algorithm of Mamba, i.e., the parallelized selective scan operation, is\
    \ essentially designed for processing one-dimensional sequential data. This poses\
    \ a challenge when attempting to adapt it for processing vision data, which inherently\
    \ lacks a sequential arrangement of visual components. To address this issue,\
    \ we propose 2D Selective Scan (SS2D), a four-way scanning mechanism tailored\
    \ for spatial domain traversal. In contrast to the self-attention mechanism (FigureÂ 1\
    \ (a)), SS2D ensures that each image patch gains contextual knowledge exclusively\
    \ through a compressed hidden state computed along the corresponding scanning\
    \ path (FigureÂ 1 (b)), thereby reducing the computational complexity from quadratic\
    \ to linear.   Figure 1: Comparison of correlation establishment between image\
    \ patches via (a) self-attention and (b) the proposed 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D).\
    \ Red boxes indicate the query image patch, with patch opacity representing the\
    \ degree of information loss.    Upon the VSS blocks, we develop a family of VMamba\
    \ architectures (i.e., VMamba-Tiny/Small/Base) and accelerate them through a series\
    \ of architectural enhancements and implementation optimizations. Compared to\
    \ benchmark vision models built on CNN (ConvNeXtÂ [38]), ViT (SwinÂ [37] and HiViTÂ [68]),\
    \ and SSM (S4NDÂ [45] and VimÂ [71]), VMamba consistently achieves superior image\
    \ classification accuracy on ImageNet-1KÂ [9] across model scales. Specifically,\
    \ VMamba-Base achieves a top-1 accuracy of 83.9%percent83.983.9\\%83.9 %, surpassing\
    \ Swin by +0.4%percent0.4+0.4\\%+ 0.4 %, with a throughput exceeding that of Swin\
    \ by a substantial margin over 40%percent4040\\%40 % (646646646646 vs. 458458458458).\
