  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in inverse rendering and novel view synthesis,
    with a focus on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance 3D
    reconstruction and scene representation. My recent work includes the development
    of TensoIR, a novel approach that combines tensor factorization with neural fields
    to achieve efficient and accurate scene modeling from multi-view images under
    unknown lighting conditions. This method not only reconstructs radiance fields
    but also estimates scene geometry and surface reflectance, enabling photo-realistic
    novel view synthesis and relighting.


    I also introduced the Large View Synthesis Model (LVSM), a transformer-based framework
    that redefines novel view synthesis by eliminating traditional 3D biases and utilizing
    a fully data-driven approach. This model has demonstrated significant improvements
    in quality and scalability, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.


    In addition, I have tackled the challenge of single image 3D reconstruction, proposing
    a method that generates full 360-degree textured meshes in a single feed-forward
    pass, significantly reducing optimization time while enhancing geometry and consistency.


    My contributions extend to creating OpenIllumination, a comprehensive dataset
    designed for evaluating inverse rendering methods, and developing RelitLRM, a
    Large Reconstruction Model that efficiently generates high-quality representations
    of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse images. Through these projects,
    I aim to push the boundaries of 3D modeling and rendering, making significant
    strides in both academic research and practical applications.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Figure 1: Single-image\
    \ relighting results on real data. Neural Gaffer supports single-image relighting\
    \ for various input images under diverse lighting conditions, using either image-conditioned\
    \ input (i.e., an environment map) or text-conditioned input (i.e., a description\
    \ of the target lighting). These results demonstrate our model’s capability to\
    \ adapt to diverse lighting scenarios while preserving the visual fidelity of\
    \ the original objects. Our relighting results remain consistent with the lighting\
    \ rotating. Please see the supplementary webpage for additional video results\
    \ produced from real input images.   Lighting plays a key role in our visual world,\
    \ serving as one of the fundamental elements that shape our interpretation and\
    \ interaction with 3D space. The interplay of light and shadows can highlight\
    \ textures, reveal contours, and enhance the perception of shape and form. In\
    \ many cases, there is a desire to relight an image—that is, to modify it as if\
    \ it were captured under different lighting conditions. Such a relighting capability\
    \ enables photo enhancement (e.g., relighting portraits [16; 63]), facilitates\
    \ consistent lighting across various scenes for filmmaking [55; 20], and supports\
    \ the seamless integration of virtual objects into real-world environments [34;\
    \ 17].   However, relighting single images is a challenging task because it involves\
    \ the complex interplay between geometry, materials, and illumination. Hence,\
    \ many classical model-based inverse rendering approaches aim to explicitly recover\
    \ shape, material properties, and lighting from input images [1; 71; 43; 79; 83],\
    \ so that they can then modify these components and rerender the image. These\
    \ methods often require multi-view inputs and can suffer from: 1) model limitations\
    \ that prevent faithful estimation of complex light, materials, and shape in real-world\
    \ scenes, and 2) ambiguities in determining these factors without strong data-driven\
    \ priors.   To circumvent these issues, image-based relighting techniques [16;\
    \ 68; 72] avoid explicit scene reconstruction and focus on high-quality image\
    \ synthesis. However, some image-based methods [16; 54; 72; 40; 2] require inputs\
    \ under multiple lighting conditions or even sophisticated capture setups (e.g.,\
    \ a light stage [16]), while recent deep learning-based techniques [63; 47; 86]\
    \ enable single-view relighting but often work only on specific categories like\
    \ portraits.   In this paper, we propose a novel category-agnostic approach for\
    \ single-view relighting that tackles the challenges mentioned above. We introduce\
    \ an end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, named Neural Gaffer, that takes\
    \ a single image of any object as input and synthesizes an accurate and high-quality\
    \ relit image under any environmental lighting condition, specified as a high-dynamic\
    \ range (HDR) environment map. In contrast to previous learning-based single-view\
    \ models that are trained for specific categories, we leverage powerful diffusion\
    \ models, trained on diverse data, and enable relighting of objects from arbitrary\
    \ categories. Unlike prior model-based approaches, our diffusion-based data-driven\
    \ framework enables the model to learn physical priors from an object-centric\
    \ synthetic dataset featuring physically-based materials and High Dynamic Range\
    \ (HDR) environment maps. This facilitates more accurate lighting effects compared\
    \ to traditional methods.   Our model exhibits superior generalization and accuracy\
    \ on both synthetic and real-world images (See Fig. 1). It also seamlessly integrates\
    \ with other generative methods for various 2D image editing tasks, such as object\
    \ insertion. Neural Gaffer also can serve as a robust relighting prior for neural\
    \ radiance fields, facilitating a novel two-stage 3D relighting pipeline. Hence,\
    \ our diffusion-based solution can relight any object under\n\n            **Your\
