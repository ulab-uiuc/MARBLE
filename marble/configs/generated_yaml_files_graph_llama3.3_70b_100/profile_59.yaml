  profile: 'I am a researcher with a keen interest in the intersection of graph theory,
    quantum structures, and machine learning. My work has primarily focused on hypergraphs
    and their applications in finite quantum event structures, where I have contributed
    significant results, including bounds on the number of edges in 3-graphs of girth
    4 and the construction of orthoalgebras with unique properties. I take pride in
    my handcrafted constructions of orthomodular posets and lattices, which provide
    insights into quantum mechanics without the need for computational verification.


    In addition to my work in quantum structures, I have delved into the convergence
    properties of message passing algorithms in graphical models. I proved a long-conjectured
    result regarding the convergence of iterates in coordinate descent methods, demonstrating
    their efficacy in reaching fixed points efficiently. This work has implications
    for various convex message passing methods, enhancing our understanding of their
    performance.


    Recently, I have also explored the realm of safety in large language models (LLMs),
    particularly focusing on jailbreaking attacks. I developed a unified threat model
    that allows for a principled comparison of these attacks, revealing insights into
    their effectiveness and the underlying mechanisms that make them successful. My
    research aims to bridge theoretical foundations with practical applications, contributing
    to both the fields of quantum theory and machine learning.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Adversarial robustness:\
    \  It is well known that a tiny, adversarial, perturbation of the input can change\
    \ the output of basically any undefended machine learning model (Biggio et al.,\
    \ 2013; Szegedy et al., 2014); this is unpleasant and we continue in the mitigation\
    \ of the problem. There are two main lines of work tackling this problem: (1)\
    \ Empirical: the standard approach here is to use adversarial training (Madry\
    \ et al., 2018; Goodfellow et al., 2014) where the model is trained on adversarial\
    \ examples. This approach does not provide guarantees, only empirical evidence\
    \ suggesting that the model may be robust. With stronger attacks, we might (yet\
    \ again) realize it is not the case. (2) Certified: with formal robustness guarantees\
    \ for the model. We will focus on this, and in particular on randomized smoothing (Lecuyer\
    \ et al., 2019) which is currently the strongest certification method. We will\
    \ not cover other certification methods and we refer the reader to the survey Li\
    \ et al. (2023) instead. We consider the standard task of certified robustness;\
    \ the goal is to decide if the decision of a classifier F\U0001D439Fitalic_F at\
    \ a particular input x\U0001D465xitalic_x is robust against additive perturbations\
    \ δ\U0001D6FF\\deltaitalic_δ such that ‖δ‖≤rnorm\U0001D6FF\U0001D45F\\left\\|\\\
    delta\\right\\|\\leq r∥ italic_δ ∥ ≤ italic_r for some norm ∥⋅∥\\left\\|\\cdot\\\
    right\\|∥ ⋅ ∥. Formally, we ask if F⁢(x)=F⁢(x′)\U0001D439\U0001D465\U0001D439\
    superscript\U0001D465′F(x)=F(x^{\\prime})italic_F ( italic_x ) = italic_F ( italic_x\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) whenever ‖x−x′‖≤rnorm\U0001D465\

    \ - italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∥ ≤ italic_r.    Randomized\
    \ smoothing  is a framework providing state of the art formal guarantees on the\
    \ adversarial robustness for many datasets. One of its benefits lies in the fact\
    \ that there are no assumptions on the model, making it possible to readily transfer\
    \ the methods from defending image classifiers against sparse pixel changes to\
    \ different modalities; e.g., defending large language models against change of\
    \ some letters/words/tokens. Randomized smoothing transforms any undefended classifier\
    \ F:ℝd→\U0001D4B4:\U0001D439→superscriptℝ\U0001D451\U0001D4B4F:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\

    \ blackboard_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_δ ∼ italic_φ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟦ italic_F\
    \ ( italic_x + italic_δ ) = italic_y ⟧ for which robustness guarantees exist.\
    \ We postpone the details for later. During the certification process, we need\
    \ to estimate the maximum probability of a multinomial distribution from samples\
    \ as the exact computation is intractable. This statistical estimation problem\
    \ is the focus of this paper.    Speed issues:  The main weakness of randomized\
    \ smoothing is the extensive time required for both prediction and certification,\
    \ making it troublesome for real-world applications. There is an inherent trade-off\
    \ between the allowed probability of incorrectly claiming robustness111of an input\
    \ for a model at a certain radius (type-1 error, α\U0001D6FC\\alphaitalic_α),\
    \ the probability of incorrectly claiming non-robustness (type-2 error, β\U0001D6FD\
    \\betaitalic_β), and the number of samples used n\U0001D45Bnitalic_n. The standard\
    \ practice is to set α=0.001\U0001D6FC0.001\\alpha=0.001italic_α = 0.001, n=100⁢000\U0001D45B\
    100000n=100~{}000italic_n = 100 000 and the value of β\U0001D6FD\\betaitalic_β\
    \ is then implicit. it might not be the most practically relevant setting since\
    \ the implicitly set value of β\U0001D6FD\\betaitalic_β is exponentially small\
    \ in n\U0001D45Bnitalic_n when the sample is not close to the threshold. The claim\
    \ is made precise in Example A.1.   The arguably more relevant setting is to set\n\
