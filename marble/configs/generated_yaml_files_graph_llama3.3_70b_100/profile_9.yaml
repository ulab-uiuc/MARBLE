  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of economics and
    algorithm design, particularly focusing on mechanisms for bilateral trade, auction
    theory, and online matching. My work explores the complexities of trading mechanisms
    in environments with multiple self-interested buyers and sellers, where I have
    established conditions under which efficient trading can be achieved. I have also
    tackled the Bidder Selection Problem (BSP) in position auctions, developing a
    novel Poisson relaxation that allows for polynomial-time solutions and practical
    implementations, significantly improving upon existing methods.


    In addition to auction theory, I have pioneered research in Coalition Structure
    Learning (CSL), designing games to infer coalition structures among agents based
    on their interactions. My contributions extend to the peer review process, where
    I have developed a randomized paper assignment method that balances various desiderata,
    enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of reviewer assignments.


    My recent work on online matching algorithms has advanced the understanding of
    competitive ratios in weighted settings, challenging existing conjectures and
    proposing new algorithms for budget-additive welfare maximization. Through theoretical
    insights and extensive experimental validation, I strive to bridge the gap between
    economic theory and practical algorithmic applications, contributing to a deeper
    understanding of strategic interactions in complex systems.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of mechanism design,
    social network analysis, and algorithmic game theory. My work explores the dynamics
    of information propagation in social networks, particularly through comparative
    ideas and the implications of submodularity in cascading models. I have developed
    innovative frameworks for automated mechanism design in dynamic environments,
    focusing on optimizing interactions between principals and agents with diverse
    valuations and strategic behaviors.


    My recent contributions include the introduction of unit-sphere games, which redefine
    strategy allocation in a novel way, and the exploration of Bayesian persuasion
    under approximate best responses, where I designed efficient algorithms to compute
    optimal strategies despite the complexities of the problem. I have also tackled
    the challenges of planning with participation constraints and automated mechanism
    design with partial verification, providing polynomial-time algorithms that enhance
    our understanding of these intricate systems.


    In addition, I have investigated the influence of hidden secondary goals in mechanism
    design, revealing the importance of nonbossy mechanisms in achieving robust outcomes.
    My research extends to the analysis of centrality measures in networks, where
    I have developed a systematic approach to assess node influence in information

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of few-shot learning
    and matrix completion, with a focus on developing innovative methodologies that
    address existing limitations. My recent work in few-shot learning introduces a
    novel meta metric learning approach that overcomes the challenges posed by traditional
    meta-learning and metric-learning techniques. By employing task-specific learners,
    my model effectively handles diverse domains and unbalanced classes, allowing
    for the generation of tailored metrics that enhance classification performance
    across various tasks.


    In the realm of matrix completion, I have critically examined the limitations
    of non-convex optimization algorithms under realistic conditions. My research
    highlights the shortcomings of existing theoretical analyses that assume uniform
    observation probabilities, which often do not hold true in practice. To address
    this, I propose a pre-processing step that re-weights semi-random inputs, enabling
    the recovery of the underlying ground-truth matrix from local minima of the non-convex
    objective. This work not only provides a nearly-linear time algorithm for the
    problem but also contributes valuable insights into the robustness of matrix completion
    techniques.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and
    practical applications, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning
    models in real-world scenarios.'

    challenges in game theory, particularly focusing on the complexities of Nash equilibria
    and evolutionarily stable strategies, where I have made significant contributions

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  In voting theory,\
    \ each voter ranks a set of candidates, and a voting rule maps the vector of rankings\
    \ to either a winning candidate or an aggregate ranking of all the candidates.\
    \ There has been significant interaction between computer scientists interested\
    \ in voting theory and the learning-to-rank community. The learning-to-rank community\
    \ is interested in problems such as ranking webpages in response to a search query,\
    \ or ranking recommendations to a user (see, e.g., Liu (2009)). Another problem\
    \ of interest is to aggregate multiple rankings into a single one, for example\
    \ combining the ranking results from different algorithms (“voters”) into a single\
    \ meta-ranking. While the interests of the communities may differ, e.g., the learning-to-rank\
    \ community is less concerned about strategic aspects of voting, a natural intersection\
    \ point for these two communities is a model where there is a latent “true” ranking\
    \ of the candidates, of which all the votes are just noisy observations. Consequently,\
    \ it is natural to try to estimate the true ranking based on the received rankings,\
    \ and such an estimation procedure corresponds to a voting rule. (See, e.g., Young\
    \ (1995); Conitzer and Sandholm (2005); Meila et al. (2007); Conitzer et al. (2009);\
    \ Caragiannis et al. (2013); Soufiani et al. (2014); Xia (2016), and Elkind and\
    \ Slinko (2015) for an overview.)   Voting rules are just one type of mechanism\
    \ in the broader field of social choice, which studies the broader problem of\
    \ making decisions based on the opinions and preferences of multiple agents. Such\
    \ opinions are not necessarily represented as rankings. For example, in judgment\
    \ aggregation (see Endriss (2015) for an overview), judges assess whether certain\
    \ propositions are true or false, and the goal is to aggregate these judgments\
    \ into logically consistent statements. The observation that other types of input\
    \ are aggregated in social choice prompts the natural question of whether analogous\
    \ problems exist in statistics and machine learning (as is the case with ranking\
    \ aggregation).   In this paper, we focus on a relatively new model in social\
    \ choice, the quantitative judgment aggregation problem (Conitzer et al., 2015,\
    \ 2016). In this problem, the goal is to aggregate relative quantitative judgments:\
    \ for example, one agent may value the life of a 20-year-old at 2 times the life\
    \ of a 50-year-old (say in the context of self-driving cars making decisions) (Noothigattu\
    \ et al., 2018); another example could be that an agent judges that “using 1 unit\
    \ of gasoline is as bad as creating 3 units of landfill trash” (in a societal\
    \ tradeoff context) (Conitzer et al., 2016). Quantitative judgment aggregation\
    \ has been considered in the area of automated moral decision-making, where an\
    \ AI system may choose a course of action based on data about human judgments\
    \ in similar scenarios.   An important conceptual difference between this work\
    \ and previous studies on quantitative judgment aggregation is that we observe\
    \ that relative “judgments” can be produced by a process other than a subjective\
    \ agent reporting them, which is the standard assumption in social choice. To\
    \ illustrate, consider a race in which contestant A finishes at 20:00 and contestant\
    \ B at 30:00. In this race, the “judgment” is that A is 10:00 faster than B. This\
    \ key observation allows us to bring the social\n\n            **Your Task**\n\
