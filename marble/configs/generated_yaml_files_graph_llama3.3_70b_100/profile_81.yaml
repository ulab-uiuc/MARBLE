  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in bilevel optimization, particularly in
    the context of machine learning. My recent work addresses the limitations of conventional
    bilevel optimization algorithms, which often assume Lipschitz continuity of the
    upper-level function. Recognizing that certain neural networks, such as recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs), can exhibit
    unbounded smoothness, I developed a novel algorithm called BO-REP. This algorithm
    introduces innovative techniques like initialization refinement and periodic updates
    to effectively manage the complexities of nonconvex upper-level problems.


    My research not only proves the efficiency of BO-REP in finding stationary points
    in stochastic settings but also matches state-of-the-art complexity results under
    bounded smoothness conditions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and practical
    experiments, I have demonstrated the algorithm''s effectiveness in various applications,
    including hyper-representation learning, hyperparameter optimization, and data
    hyper-cleaning for text classification tasks. I am passionate about pushing the
    boundaries of optimization techniques to enhance machine learning performance
    and contribute to the broader understanding of complex neural network behaviors.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher with a keen interest in the interplay between combinatorial
    structures and probability theory. My work often revolves around the concept of
    telescoping sums, which I have found to yield intriguing probability distributions
    on the positive integers. In my recent publications, I have explored "first occurrence"
    distributions that emerge from concrete questions related to the structure of
    permutations, demonstrating the practical significance of these mathematical constructs.


    Additionally, I have delved into the realm of random variables, particularly focusing
    on the distribution of extrema from a random number of independent and identically
    distributed (i.i.d.) variables. This work has allowed me to outline a general
    framework while also investigating specific cases in detail, providing estimates
    for key parameters in these distributions.


    My research also extends to coding theory, where I study locally repairable codes
    (LRCs). I have contributed to understanding optimal ternary LRCs that meet the
    Singleton-like bound, identifying only eight classes of parameters for which these
    codes exist. Through a parity-check matrix approach, I have developed explicit
    constructions for these optimal codes, enhancing our understanding of their minimum
    distance properties.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    contributing to both the fields of probability and coding theory.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of graph theory and
    optimization, with a particular focus on the dynamics of games played on graphs
    and advanced algorithms for non-convex optimization problems. My recent work has
    explored the game of cops and robbers on directed graphs, where I introduced new
    concepts to analyze cop numbers in various graph families. I have also delved
    into convex-concave min-max problems, demonstrating how strict convexity and concavity
    can lead to improved convergence rates, and developed novel algorithms that achieve
    initialization-dependent convergence.


    In the realm of stochastic optimization, I have made significant strides in addressing
    challenges associated with non-convex random functions, proposing algorithms that
    achieve high-probability second-order convergence. My research extends to bilevel
    optimization, where I designed a new algorithm, BO-REP, that effectively handles
    unbounded smoothness in neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art complexity
    results.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the development of communication-efficient
    algorithms for distributed training of deep neural networks, particularly in the
    context of gradient clipping and federated learning. My work emphasizes the importance
    of stability and generalization in optimization methods, providing a comprehensive
    analysis of minibatch and local SGD.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of algorithms in machine learning and
    optimization. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible
    in these fields and continuously seek to explore new avenues for innovation.'

    \ for algorithmic design and analysis for solving the bilevel optimization problem (1)\
    \ under different assumptions of f\U0001D453fitalic_f and g\U0001D454gitalic_g.\
    \ Most theoretical work assumes the upper-level function is smooth (i.e., gradient\
    \ is Lipschitz) and nonconvex, and the lower-level function is strongly convex [28,\
    \ 39, 38, 31, 43]. However, as pointed out by [70, 16], certain neural networks\
    \ such as recurrent neural networks [20], long-short term memory networks [37]\
    \ and transformers [60] have smoothness constants that scale with gradient norm,\
    \ potentially leading to unbounded smoothness constants (i.e., gradient Lipschitz\
    \ constant can be infinity). Motivated by this, Hao et al. [34] designed the first\
    \ bilevel optimization algorithm to handle the cases where f\U0001D453fitalic_f\
    \ is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and g\U0001D454gitalic_g\
    \ is strongly convex. The algorithm in [34] achieves O~⁢(1/ϵ4)~\U0001D4421superscriptitalic-ϵ4\\\

    \ Gong et al. [30] proposed an single-loop algorithm under the same setting as\
