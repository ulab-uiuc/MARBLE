  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of robotics, computer
    vision, and machine learning, with a particular focus on enhancing the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous systems. My recent work has centered on integrating
    reinforcement learning with classical planning to develop meta-planners that improve
    robot navigation. I introduced DIGIMON, a framework that enhances exploration
    in RL-based meta-planners, resulting in significant performance improvements and
    increased training efficiency.


    In the realm of monocular depth estimation (MDE), I have tackled the challenges
    posed by adversarial attacks, particularly in autonomous driving applications.
    My self-supervised adversarial training approach enhances the robustness of MDE
    models against physical attacks, demonstrating improved performance without relying
    on ground-truth depth. Additionally, I have developed a novel framework, ROCAS,
    for root cause analysis in autonomous driving systems, which effectively identifies
    accident triggers and misconfigurations.


    My research also explores the vulnerabilities of multi-sensor fusion models, revealing
    how single-modal attacks can compromise their performance. I have designed stealthy
    adversarial patches that significantly degrade detection capabilities in real-world
    scenarios. Furthermore, I have contributed to the development of the Sufficient
    Vision Transformer (Suf-ViT), which effectively filters out task-irrelevant information
    to enhance model performance.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical
    applications, ensuring that autonomous systems are not only efficient but also
    secure and reliable in real-world environments.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the safety and reliability of
    autonomous driving systems (ADS). As these systems increasingly integrate into
    our daily lives, understanding the causes of accidents has become a critical area
    of focus. My recent work addresses a significant gap in post-accident analysis,
    particularly in adapting existing cyber-physical system (CPS) root cause analysis
    techniques to the unique challenges posed by ADS.


    In my latest publication, I introduced ROCAS, a novel framework for ADS root cause
    analysis that employs cyber-physical co-mutation. This approach allows for a comprehensive
    examination of both physical and cyber elements involved in accidents, enabling
    precise identification of the accident-triggering entities and misconfigurations
    within the ADS. By conducting differential analyses, I have developed methods
    to effectively narrow down the search space for potential misconfigurations, which
    is crucial for understanding the underlying reasons behind accidents.


    Through the study of 12 categories of ADS accidents, I have demonstrated the effectiveness
    and efficiency of ROCAS, providing detailed case studies that illustrate how identifying
    misconfigurations can lead to valuable insights for improving ADS safety. My work
    aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications,
    ultimately contributing to the development of safer autonomous driving technologies.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  3D object detection\
    \ is a critical task in the perception of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this task,\
    \ AVs employ camera and/or LiDAR sensors input to predict the location, size,\
    \ and categories of surrounding objects. Camera-LiDAR fusion models, which combine\
    \ the high-resolution 2D texture information from camera images with the rich\
    \ 3D distance information from LiDAR point clouds, have outperformed the detection\
    \ accuracy of models that rely solely on cameras or LiDAR. (Yang et al., 2022;\
    \ Liu et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2022b). Additionally, multi-sensor fusion (MSF)\
    \ techniques are generally recognized as a defensive measure against attacks (Cao\
    \ et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2022), as the extra modality provides supplementary\
    \ information to validate detection results. Viewed in this light, a counter-intuitive\
    \ yet innovative question arises: ❶ Can we attack fusion models through a single\
    \ modality, even the less significant one, thereby directly challenging the security\
    \ assumption of MSF? Yet, this fundamental question has not been sufficiently\
    \ answered in the literature.   Previous research has demonstrated successful\
    \ attacks against camera-LiDAR fusion models by targeting either multiple modalities (Cao\
    \ et al., 2021; Tu et al., 2021) or the LiDAR modality alone (Hallyburton et al.,\
    \ 2022). However, these approaches are not easy to implement and require additional\
    \ equipment such as photodiodes, laser diodes (Hallyburton et al., 2022), and\
    \ industrial-grade 3D printers (Cao et al., 2021; Tu et al., 2021) to manipulate\
    \ LiDAR data, thus increasing the deployment cost for attackers. Consequently,\
    \ we explore the possibility of attacking fusion models via the camera modality,\
    \ as attackers can more easily perturb captured images using affordable adversarial\
    \ patches. Nevertheless, this attack design presents additional challenges. For\
    \ example, the camera modality is considered less significant in fusion models\
    \ for 3D object detection since LiDAR provides abundant 3D information. The performance\
    \ of both state-of-the-art LiDAR-based models and ablations of fusion models using\
    \ only LiDAR surpasses their solely camera-based counterparts significantly (Liang\
    \ et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023b; Motional, 2023) (see more experimental results\
    \ in Appendix A). The less significance of camera modality in fusion can limit\
    \ its impact on detection results. Moreover, different fusion models can exhibit\
    \ distinct vulnerabilities in the camera modality, necessitating varying attack\
    \ strategies. The cutting-edge adversarial patch optimization technique against\
    \ camera-only models (Cheng et al., 2022) has limitations in generating deployable\
    \ patches viewing the entire scene, as they fail to consider the semantics of\
    \ the input. Hence, a problem remains open: ❷ How to design single-modal attack\
    \ to effectively subvert fusion models?   Figure 1: Single-modal attacks against\
    \ camera-LiDAR fusion model using camera-modality.   In response to ❶ and ❷, we\
    \ propose a novel attack framework against camera-LiDAR fusion models through\
    \ the less significant camera modality. We utilize adversarial patches as the\
    \ attack vector, aiming to cause false negative detection results, and our main\
    \ focus lies on the early-fusion scheme, including data-level and feature-level\
    \ fusion strategies. As shown in Figure 1, our attack employs a two-stage approach\
    \ to generate an optimal adversarial patch for the target fusion model. In the\
    \ first stage (2n⁢d\U0001D45B\U0001D451{}^{nd}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_n\
    \ italic_d end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT column), we identify vulnerable regions in the\
    \ image input using our novel sensitivity distribution recognition algorithm.\
    \ The algorithm employs an optimizable mask to identify the sensitivity of different\
    \ image areas under adversarial attacks. Based on the identified vulnerable regions,\
    \ we then classify the fusion model as either\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n\
