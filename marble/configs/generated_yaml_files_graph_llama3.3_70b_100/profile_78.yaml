  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction As industries ranging\
    \ from film production to virtual reality seek increasingly immersive and interactive\
    \ experiences, the ability to generate dynamic 3D scenes over time—essentially,\
    \ 4D environments—promises to revolutionize how we interact with digital content.\
    \ Recently, significant advances in image and video generation have been driven\
    \ by large-scale text-image and text-video datasets, along with the development\
    \ of diffusion models. Furthermore, image diffusion models have been adapted into\
    \ 3D-aware multi-view generative models through fine-tuning with limited 3D data,\
    \ serving as foundational priors for 3D and 4D generation. In this work, we focus\
    \ on photorealistic text-to-4D scene generation, Existing 4D generation pipelines,\
    \ due to the lack of 4D data, typically employ image, multi-view, and video generation\
    \ models as priors to synthesize 4D samples. However, the multi-view models, which\
    \ provide critical 3D information, are fine-tuned on static and synthetic 3D assets.\
    \ As a result, current generated 4D results obtained from COLMAP [ 44]. We adhered\
    \ to the training settings specified in [ 22] for the canonical GS training. The\
    \ learning rate for the positions of the Gaussians was set to undergo exponential\
    \ decay, starting from 1.6×10−4and decreasing to 1.6×10−6. Additionally, the learning\
    \ rate for both scale and rotation parameters was maintained at 1×10−3throughout\
    \ the training process. The learning rate for the deformation network was set\
    \ to exponentially decay from 1×10−3to1×10−5. The optimization across these processes\
    \ was conducted using the Adam optimizer [ 23] with βparameters set to (0.9,0.999).\
    \ All background that looks more like taken with real video camera, pay attention\
    \ to unnatural color or styles of the objects or bluriness. •3D Shape Realism:\
    \ That is the video in which main object has the most natural shape, again pay\
    \ attention to deformed limbs of human and animals and unnatural deformations.\
    \ •General Realism: Please provide your subjective appraisal of which video, in\
    \ your opinion, stands out as superior based on appearance quality, 3D structure\
    \ quality, and motion quality. •Significance of Motion: The video that contain\
    \ the most amount of motion. Please exclude from consideration any random limbs\
    \ deformations. •Video-text Alignment: That is which video reflect all the aspects\
    \ included in the text description. 17Figure 8: Screenshot of the user study webpage.\
    \ 18 experiments were performed on single NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB of memory.\
    \ 16E Key Hyperparameters E.1 Loss Weighting For the regularization terms mentioned\
    \ above, we assign a weight of 0.01 to each within the overall loss function,\
    \ ensuring they contribute appropriately to the optimization process. For the\
    \ reconstruction loss, we use a weight of 1. Additionally, for the SDS loss, we\
    \ differentiate the weights based on the type of SDS being applied: a weight of\
    \ 20 for temporal SDS and a weight of 5 for multi-view SDS. These weights are\
    \ chosen to effectively capture motion dynamics and stabilize the training process.\
    \ E.2 GS Growth Threshold For the GS growth stage during the canonical space reconstruction,\
    \ we set the opacity threshold to τα= 5×10−3and the gradient threshold to τgrad=\
    \ 2×10−4. These thresholds help control the addition of new Gaussians based on\
    \ their opacity and gradient values. In contrast, for the GS growth stage during\
    \ motion fitting, we use a relatively higher opacity threshold of τα= 1×10−2to\
    \ avoid introducing redundant Gaussians. This higher threshold ensures that only\
    \ significant Gaussians are added, which aids in maintaining efficiency and relevance\
    \ during the motion fitting process. F User Study Details The user study was conducted\n\
