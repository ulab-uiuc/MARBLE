  profile: 'I am a researcher with a strong focus on the intersection of statistical
    mechanics, computer vision, and optical engineering. My work primarily revolves
    around the Jarzynski equality (JE), which I have leveraged to develop innovative
    methods for calculating free energy differences (FED) in a more efficient manner.
    By introducing integrable virtual systems, I have transformed the computation
    of FED into an equilibrium equality, significantly reducing the computational
    cost and enhancing the accuracy of numerical studies across various model systems.


    In the realm of computer vision, I have explored the challenges of feature fusion
    from diverse representations and modalities. My approach involves constructing
    similarity graphs that capture structural relationships and deep feature interactions,
    allowing for more effective fusion of multi-representational data. This relationship-centric
    method has shown promising results, particularly in video anomaly detection, where
    traditional fusion techniques often fall short.


    Additionally, I have conducted experimental research at the Shanghai Astronomical
    Observatory, focusing on the capabilities of pyramid wavefront sensors (WFS) in
    measuring differential piston on sparse apertures. This work aims to advance the
    phasing of primary mirrors in Fizeau imaging telescopes, contributing to the field
    of optical engineering.


    Overall, my research is characterized by a commitment to bridging theoretical
    concepts with practical applications, driving advancements in both fundamental
    science and technology.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Figure 1: A comparison\
    \ of existing datasets such as UCSD Ped, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime,\
    \ UBnormal and CUVA vs. our Multi-Scenario Anomaly Detection (MSAD) dataset. \
    \   Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically identify unusual occurrences\
    \ in videos, enabling various applications in surveillance and monitoring [82].\
    \ Detecting anomalies is a challenging and complex task due to several factors:\
    \ (i) There is no unified and clear definition of anomalies of interest. For example,\
    \ the distinction between normal activities like walking on a sidewalk and abnormal\
    \ activities like walking on a highway is context-dependent. (ii) The sporadic\
    \ and rare occurrences of anomalies make the collection of well-curated datasets\
    \ a demanding task, limiting the ability to learn anomalous patterns. Existing\
    \ methods often treat VAD as either a one-class classification problem or an out-of-distribution\
    \ detection task  [4, 22, 36, 7, 24, 98, 20, 61, 27, 81, 50]. These approaches\
    \ rely on training solely with normal samples and testing on both normal and abnormal\
    \ samples, treating anomalies as outliers. Significant progress has been made\
    \ in VAD during the past few years, thanks to benchmark datasets [35, 79, 37,\
    \ 72, 14, 97], as well as synthetic data generation [2] that presents a range\
    \ of anomalies. Fig. 1 shows some frames from different datasets.   Surveys. Advances\
    \ in VAD have also led to some comprehensive surveys contributing significantly\
    \ to the literature [71, 1, 69, 14, 28]. A survey on deep learning models for\
    \ VAD can be found in [71]. A comprehensive study in [1] highlights challenging\
    \ issues in VAD, such as varying environments, the complexity of human activities,\
    \ the ambiguous nature of anomalies, and the absence of appropriate datasets.\
    \ A systematic review in [69] discusses various potential challenges, opportunities,\
    \ and provides guidance for future research. A recent work [14] offers a comprehensive\
    \ benchmark for understanding VAD causation using Large Language Models (LLMs)\
    \ for text annotations on human-related anomalies. While we focus on static cameras,\
    \ a survey on VAD in dynamic scenes captured by moving cameras can be found in [28].\
    \ Although these surveys are comprehensive, they are not portable and lightweight.\
    \ Our lightweight review offers several benefits: (i) it provides a quick reference\
    \ for researchers and practitioners, making it easier to get up to speed on VAD\
    \ without sifting through extensive details; (ii) it enhances accessibility for\
    \ a broader audience, including newcomers to the field, by allowing a quick grasp\
    \ of essential concepts; and (iii) it offers focused guidance by distilling critical\
    \ information into clear, actionable insights.   Challenges. Various studies [103,\
    \ 75] indicate that existing methods are often restricted to detecting only a\
    \ handful of specific anomalies due to (i) a limited amount of videos and (ii)\
    \ limited camera viewpoints, scenarios and anomaly types per dataset. These methods\
    \ also frequently suffer from poor generalizability, necessitating retraining\
    \ for each unique target camera viewpoint or new scenario, which subsequently\
    \ increases computational costs [11]. Most existing methods [59, 15, 10, 97] are\
    \ particularly vulnerable to various factors such as reflection, illumination\
    \ changes, and complex background environments, leading to frequent false positives\
    \ and negatives, thereby affecting the precision and reliability of detection.\
    \ These challenges highlight the need for a high-quality, multi-scenario, and\
    \ comprehensive dataset. However, existing benchmarks mostly focus\n\n       \
