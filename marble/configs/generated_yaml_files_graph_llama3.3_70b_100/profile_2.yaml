  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the field of generative modeling,
    with a particular focus on discrete data applications that span from language
    models to protein design. My recent work has centered on steering Masked Diffusion
    Models (MDMs) through the Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction (DDPP) framework,
    which allows for scalable, simulation-free steering of generative processes using
    non-differentiable reward functions. This has enabled me to explore class-conditional
    image modeling and optimize protein sequences for desired properties, validated
    through wet-lab experiments.


    I have also developed FoldFlow-2, a novel model for protein structure generation
    that leverages a large language model and a geometric transformer-based decoder.
    This work emphasizes diversity in generated samples, crucial for drug design,
    and demonstrates significant improvements over previous models.


    My research extends to understanding the implications of synthetic data in generative
    modeling, where I have theoretically analyzed the effects of data curation on
    iterative retraining processes. I introduced Metric Flow Matching (MFM), a framework
    that allows for more meaningful interpolations in generative tasks by learning
    approximate geodesics on data manifolds.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the development of Fisher-Flow, a flow-matching
    model for discrete data that utilizes the Fisher-Rao metric for optimal training
    dynamics. My work on generative models has consistently aimed to bridge theoretical
    insights with practical applications, leading to state-of-the-art results across
    various benchmarks.


    Through my research, I strive to push the boundaries of generative modeling, ensuring
    that the models we develop are not only powerful but also aligned with real-world
    applications and biological relevance.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the intersection of machine learning
    and computational biology, particularly in the context of protein structure generation
    and reinforcement learning. My recent work has focused on developing innovative
    models like FoldFlow-2, which leverages the rich biological context of amino acid
    sequences to generate diverse and novel protein structures. This model incorporates
    a protein large language model and a geometric transformer-based decoder, significantly
    improving upon previous generative models in terms of designability and diversity.


    In addition to protein modeling, I have explored energy-based policies in reinforcement
    learning through my work on Diffusion Q-Sampling (DQS). This approach enhances
    the expressiveness of policy representations, allowing for better exploration
    in continuous action spaces. My research also delves into the integration of symmetries
    in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), where I propose novel loss functions
    that incorporate Lie point symmetries to improve sample efficiency and generalization
    across varied initial conditions.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    whether in drug design or solving complex partial differential equations, and

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Proteins are one\
    \ of the basic building blocks of life. Their complex geometric structure enables\
    \ specific inter-molecular interactions that allow for crucial functions within\
    \ organisms, such as acting as catalysts in chemical reactions, transporters for\
    \ molecules, and providing immune responses. Normally, such functions arise as\
    \ a result of evolution. With the emergence of computational techniques, it has\
    \ become possible to rationally design novel proteins with desired structures\
    \ that program their functions. Such methods are now seen as the future of drug\
    \ design and can lead to solutions to long-standing global health challenges.\
    \ Some recent examples include rationally designed protein binders for receptors\
    \ related to influenza (Strauch et al., 2017), COVID-19 (Cao et al., 2020a; Gainza\
    \ et al., 2023), and cancer (Silva et al., 2019).              Method  Any source\

    \   In protein engineering, the term de novo design refers to a setting when a\
    \ new protein is designed to satisfy pre-specified structural and functional properties (Huang\
    \ et al., 2016). Chemically, a protein is a sequence of amino acids (residues)\
    \ linked into a chain that folds into a complex 3D structure under the influence\
    \ of electrostatic forces. The protein backbone can be seen as N\U0001D441Nitalic_N\
    \ rigid bodies (corresponding to N\U0001D441Nitalic_N residues) that contain four\

    \ Mathematically, each residue can be associated with a frame that adheres to\
    \ the symmetries of orientation-preserving rigid transformations (3D rotations\
    \ and translations), forming the special Euclidean group SE⁢(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE(3)}roman_SE\
    \ ( 3 ) (Jumper et al., 2021); the entire protein backbone is described by the\

    \ of protein design can be formulated as sampling from the distribution over this\
    \ group, which is a perspective used in our paper. Recently, generative models\
    \ have been generalized to Riemannian manifolds (Mathieu & Nickel, 2020; De Bortoli\
    \ et al., 2022). However, they are not purpose-built to exploit the rich geometric\

    \ several approaches require numerically expensive steps like simulating a Stochastic\
    \ Differential Equation (SDE) during training or using the Riemannian divergence\
    \ in the objective (Huang et al., 2022; Leach et al., 2022; Ben-Hamu et al., 2022).\
    \   Our approach. We introduce FoldFlow, a family of continuous normalizing flows\
    \ (CNFs) tailored for distributions on SE⁢(3)NSEsuperscript3\U0001D441\\mathrm{SE(3)}^{\\\

    \ (fig. 1). We use the framework of Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a simulation-free\
    \ approach to learning CNFs by directly regressing time-dependent vector fields\
    \ that generate probability paths  (Lipman et al., 2022; Tong et al., 2023b).\
    \ In particular, we introduce three new CFM-based models that learn SE⁢(3)NSEsuperscript3\U0001D441\
