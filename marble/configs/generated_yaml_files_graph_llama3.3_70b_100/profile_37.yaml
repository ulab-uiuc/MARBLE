  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of privacy-preserving
    machine learning and federated learning (FL), with a particular focus on its applications
    in relational data and recommender systems. My recent work has explored innovative
    frameworks such as FedAlign, which addresses data heterogeneity in knowledge graphs,

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Over the past few\
    \ years, growing concerns over information abundance and data leakage have intensified\
    \ the focus on privacy preservation within artificial intelligence. Regulations\
    \ such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Union, 2018), the California\
    \ Consumer Privacy Act (Pardau, 2018)and the Delete Act (Information, 2023) grant\
    \ individuals the right to be forgotten, requiring the deletion of personal data\
    \ used in information systems. Nowadays, the ubiquitous application of machine\
    \ learning models in information systems poses potential risks for memorizing\
    \ training data (Fredrikson et al., 2015). Consequently, the aforementioned regulations\
    \ also require forgetting the associated data memory within the trained models,\
    \ giving rise to the concept of machine unlearning. Recently, machine unlearning\
    \ has gained increasing popularity in computer vision (Bourtoule et al., 2021;\
    \ Gupta et al., 2021), natural language processing (Chen & Yang, 2023; Eldan &\
    \ Russinovich, 2023), and recommender systems (Chen et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a,\
    \ b). As recommender systems typically rely on historical interaction data to\
    \ extract user preferences, the recommendation model inherently contains sensitive\
    \ user information. Therefore, there is a crucial need for unlearning to preserve\
    \ privacy. The task of machine unlearning in recommender systems is termed as\
    \ recommendation unlearning.   While machine unlearning has demonstrated significant\
    \ potential in preserving user privacy, conducting a comprehensive evaluation\
    \ of unlearning methods continues to pose difficulties. Various unlearning methods\
    \ employ distinct evaluation metrics, yet a universally applicable evaluation\
    \ framework remains absent. Specifically, existing evaluation methods predominantly\
    \ focus on the unlearning completeness, unlearning efficiency, and its impact\
    \ on model utility, overlooking the deeper influence of model properties.   In\
    \ this paper, we identify two overlooked aspects of deeper influence. Firstly,\
    \ fairness is a crucial consideration for recommendations (Wang et al., 2023),\
    \ but is often neglected in unlearning evaluations. Ensuring fair recommendation\
    \ outcomes can avoid user discrimination and enrich the recommendation platform’s\
    \ understanding of user preferences. Existing studies demonstrate that unlearning\
    \ can affect the fairness of models (Oesterling et al., 2024). Secondly, existing\
    \ evaluation methods neglect the influence of various unlearning sets, randomly\
    \ selecting data for unlearning. Distinct unlearning sets, however, can result\
    \ in significantly different impacts on model performance (Fan et al., 2024).\
    \ Performing comprehensive evaluations on different unlearning data contributes\
    \ to understanding the robustness of unlearning methods.   Figure 1: An illustration\
    \ of CURE4Rec, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for evaluating recommendation\
    \ unlearning methods. CURE4Rec evaluates unlearning methods using data with varying\
    \ levels of unlearning impact on four aspects, i.e., unlearning completeness,\
    \ recommendation utility, unlearning efficiency, and recommendation fairness.\
    \   To address these issues, we introduce CURE4Rec, a comprehensive benchmark\
    \ specifically designed to evaluate recommendation unlearning methods. As shown\
    \ in Figure 1, CURE4Rec’s evaluation encompasses four aspects, i.e., unlearning\
    \ completeness, recommendation utility, unlearning efficiency, and recommendation\
    \ fairness. Additionally, each aspect is investigated with three data selection\
    \ strategies, i.e., core data, edge data, and random data. This triadic breakdown\
    \ tests to reflect the robustness of recommendation unlearning methods towards\
    \ different unlearning sets. The main contributions of this work are summarized\
    \ as follows:   •  We introduce CURE4Rec, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for\
    \ evaluating recommendation unlearning methods. CURE4Rec enables evaluation across\
    \ multiple aspects, including unlearning completeness, recommendation utility,\
    \ unlearning efficiency, and recommendation fairness.    •  To the best of our\
    \ knowledge, we are the first to investigate the impact of unlearning on recommendation\
    \ fairness, introducing fairness evaluation to comprehensively grasp its impact\n\
