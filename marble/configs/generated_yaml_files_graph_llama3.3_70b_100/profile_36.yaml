  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Time series forecasting\
    \ has emerged as a crucial task in various domains such as cloud computing, air\
    \ quality forecasting, energy management, and traffic flow estimation(Qian et al.,\
    \ 2022; Liang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023a). The rapid development\
    \ of deep learning models has led to significant advancements in time series forecasting\
    \ techniques, particularly in multivariate time series forecasting. Among various\
    \ deep learning models developed for time series forecasting, RNN, CNN, MLP, transformer,\
    \ and LLM-based models have demonstrated great performance thanks to their ability\
    \ to capture complex long-term temporal dependencies (e.g., Zhou et al., 2021;\
    \ Challu et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022a; Wu et al., 2023b;\
    \ Zhou et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023).   For multivariate time series forecasting,\
    \ a model is expected to yield a better performance by exploiting the dependence\
    \ among different prediction variables, so-called channel-dependent (CD) methods.\
    \ However, multiple recent works (e.g., Nie et al. 2023; Zeng et al. 2023) show\
    \ that, in general, channel-independent (CI) forecasting models (i.e., all the\
    \ time series variables are forecast independently) outperform the CD models.\
    \ Analysis from (Han et al., 2023) indicates that CI forecasting models are more\
    \ robust while CD models have higher modeling capacity. Given that time series\
    \ forecasting usually involves high noise levels, typical transformer-based forecasting\
    \ models with CD design can suffer from the issue of overfitting noises, leading\
    \ to limited performance. These empirical studies and analyses raised an important\
    \ question, i.e., how to build an effective transformer to utilize the cross-channel\
    \ information for time series forecasting.   In this paper, we propose a Channel\
    \ Aligned Robust Blend Transformer, or CARD for short, that effectively leverages\
    \ the dependence among channels (i.e., forecasting variables) and alleviates the\
    \ issue of overfitting noises in time series forecasting. Unlike typical transformers\
    \ for time series analysis that only capture temporal dependency among signals\
    \ through attention over tokens, the CARD also takes attention across different\
    \ channels and hidden dimensions, which captures the correlation among prediction\
    \ variables and aligns local information within each token. We observe that related\
    \ approaches have been exploited in computer vision (Ding et al., 2022; Ali et al.,\
    \ 2021). Moreover, it is known that multi-scale information plays an important\
    \ role in time series analysis. We design a token blend module to generate tokens\
    \ with different resolutions. In particular, we propose to combine the adjacent\
    \ tokens within the same head into the new token instead of merging the same position\
    \ over different heads in multi-head attention. To improve the robustness and\
    \ efficiency of the transformer for time series forecast, we further introduce\
    \ an exponential smoothing layer over queries/keys tokens and a dynamic projection\
    \ module when dealing with information among different channels. Finally, to alleviate\
    \ the issue of overfitting noises, a robust loss function is introduced to weight\
    \ each prediction by its uncertainty in the case of forecasting over a finite\
    \ horizon. The overall model architecture is illustrated in Figure  1. We verify\
    \ the effectiveness of the proposed model on various numerical benchmarks by comparing\
    \ it to the state-of-the-art methods for Transformers and other models. Here we\
    \ summarized our key contributions as follows:     1.  We propose a Channel Aligned\
    \ Robust Blend Transformer (CARD) which efficiently and robustly\n\n         \
