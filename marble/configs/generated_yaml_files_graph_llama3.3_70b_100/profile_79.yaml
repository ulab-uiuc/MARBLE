  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.

    \ consisting of observations sampled from their joint distribution. Learning conditional\
    \ distributions is a fundamental problem in machine learning, crucial for various\
    \ purposes such as building prediction intervals, performing downstream analysis,\
    \ visualizing data, and interpreting outcomes. This entails predicting the probability\
    \ of an event given certain conditions or variables, which is a crucial task across\
    \ various domains, ranging from finance (Markowitz,, 1958) to medicine (Ray et al.,,\
    \ 2017), to climate modeling (Harrington,, 2017) and beyond. For instance, in\
    \ finance, it is essential for risk assessment to estimate the probability of\
    \ default given economic indicators. Similarly, in healthcare, predicting the\
    \ likelihood of a disease, given patient symptoms, aids in diagnosis. In climate\
    \ modeling, estimating the conditional probability of extreme weather events such\
    \ as hurricanes or droughts, given specific climate indicators, helps in disaster\
    \ preparedness and mitigation efforts.   According to Gao and Hastie, (2022),\
    \ there exist four main strategies to learn the conditional distribution. The\
    \ first one relies on the Bayes formula for densities and proposes to apply non-parametric\
    \ statistics to learn the joint and marginal densities separately. However, most\
    \ of non-parametric techniques face a significant challenge known as the curse\
    \ of dimensionality (Scott,, 1991; Nagler and Czado,, 2016). The second strategy,\
    \ also known as Localization method, involves training a model unconditionally\
    \ on reweighted samples, where weights are determined by their proximity to the\
    \ desired conditioning point (Hall et al.,, 1999; Yu and Jones,, 1998). However,\
    \ these methods demand retraining the model whenever the conditioning changes\
    \ and are prone to the curse of dimensionality if the weighting strategy treats\
    \ all covariates equally. The third strategy, known as Direct Learning of the\
    \ conditional distribution involves finding the best linear approximation of the\
    \ conditional density on a dictionary of base functions or a kernel space (Sugiyama\
    \ et al.,, 2010; Li et al.,, 2007). The performance of these methods relies crucially\
    \ on the selection of bases and kernels. Again for high-dimensional settings,\
    \ approaches that assign equal importance to all covariates may be less effective.\
    \ Finally, the fourth strategy, known as Conditional Training, is an approach\
    \ in which models are trained to estimate a target variable conditional on certain\
    \ covariates or conditions. This typically involves partitioning the covariate\
    \ space \U0001D4B3\U0001D4B3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X into sets, followed by unconditional\
    \ training of models for each set of the partition (see Gao and Hastie,, 2022;\
    \ Winkler et al.,, 2020; Lu and Huang,, 2020; Dhariwal and Nichol,, 2021, and\
    \ references therein). However, this strategy requires a large dataset to provide\
    \ enough samples for each conditioning and is expensive as it requires training\
    \ separate models for each conditioning input set, even though they stem from\
    \ the same underlying joint distribution.   Contributions   The principal contribution\
    \ of this work is a different conditional probability approach that does not fall\
    \ into any of the four aforementioned strategies. Our method, called Neural Conditional\n\
