    in the areas of reinforcement learning (RL) and autonomous control. My work focuses
    on developing innovative algorithms and frameworks that enable robots to learn
    and adapt to complex tasks in real-world environments. I have created a racing
    simulation platform using Assetto Corsa to benchmark autonomous driving algorithms,
    and I have explored the potential of generalist policies that can be efficiently
    adapted across various robots and tasks.


    My research has led to the development of several key contributions, including
    the RT-X model for robotic manipulation, which demonstrates positive transfer
    across different platforms, and the GNFactor agent that optimizes visual behavior
    cloning for multi-task manipulation. I have also introduced the PWM algorithm,
    which leverages large multi-task world models for efficient policy learning, and
    the MoDem-V2 system, which enables robots to learn dexterous manipulation skills
    directly in uninstrumented real-world settings.


    I am particularly interested in the intersection of model-based RL and visual
    learning, as evidenced by my work on XTRA, which enhances sample efficiency through
    cross-task transfer. My research aims to bridge the gap between simulation and
    real-world applications, ensuring that robots can effectively learn from visual
    feedback and adapt to dynamic environments. I am committed to sharing my findings
    and tools with the community, as I believe collaboration is essential for driving
    innovation in robotics. You can find my work and resources at my project websites,
    where I provide code, datasets, and videos to support further exploration in this
    exciting field.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of robotics, particularly
    in the development of generalist manipulation policies that can adapt to a wide
    range of tasks and environments. My recent work has focused on addressing the
    challenges of evaluating these policies in real-world settings, where control
    and visual disparities between simulation and reality can hinder reproducibility.
    To tackle this, I created SIMPLER, a collection of simulated environments that
    closely correlate with real-world performance, enabling robust evaluation of manipulation
    policies.


    In my pursuit of enhancing generalization in robotic learning, I introduced the
    RT-Trajectory method, which utilizes rough trajectory sketches to condition policies
    for new tasks. This approach allows for intuitive human input and effective task
    execution, bridging the gap between low-level motion guidance and situational
    context.


    Additionally, I am exploring the potential for a consolidated approach in robotics,
    akin to the pretrained models seen in NLP and computer vision. By assembling a
    comprehensive dataset from 22 different robots and demonstrating the capabilities
    of a high-capacity model, RT-X, I aim to show that we can efficiently adapt policies
    across various robots and tasks. My work is driven by a commitment to making robotic
    systems more versatile and capable, ultimately facilitating broader applications
    in real-world scenarios.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Training large models\
    \ on internet-scale datasets has led to generalist models that perform a wide\
    \ variety of language and vision tasks (Brown et al., 2020; He et al., 2022; Kirillov\
    \ et al., 2023). The success of these models can largely be attributed to the\
    \ availability of enormous datasets, and carefully designed architectures that\
    \ reliably scale with model and data size. While researchers have recently extended\
    \ this paradigm to robotics (Reed et al., 2022; Brohan et al., 2023), a generalist\
    \ embodied agent that learns to perform diverse control tasks via low-level actions,\
    \ across multiple embodiments, from large uncurated (i.e., mixed-quality) datasets\
    \ remains an elusive goal. We argue that current approaches to generalist embodied\
    \ agents suffer from (a) the assumption of near-expert trajectories for behavior\
    \ cloning which severely limits the amount of available data (Reed et al., 2022;\
    \ Lee et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Schubert et al., 2023; Driess et al.,\
    \ 2023; Brohan et al., 2023), and (b) a lack of scalable continuous control algorithms\
    \ that are able to consume large uncurated datasets.   Reinforcement Learning\
    \ (RL) is an ideal framework for extracting expert behavior from uncurated datasets.\
    \ However, most existing RL algorithms (Lillicrap et al., 2016; Haarnoja et al.,\
    \ 2018) are designed for single-task learning and rely on per-task hyperparameters,\
    \ with no principled method for selecting those hyperparameters (Zhang et al.,\
    \ 2021). An algorithm that can consume large multi-task datasets will invariably\
    \ need to be robust to variation between different tasks (e.g., action space dimensionality,\
    \ difficulty of exploration, and reward distribution). In this work, we present\
    \ TD-MPC2: a significant step towards achieving this goal. TD-MPC2 is a model-based\
    \ RL algorithm designed for learning generalist world models on large uncurated\
    \ datasets composed of multiple task domains, embodiments, and action spaces,\
    \ with data sourced from behavior policies that cover a wide range of skill levels,\
    \ and without the need for hyperparameter-tuning.   Our algorithm, which builds\
    \ upon TD-MPC (Hansen et al., 2022), performs local trajectory optimization in\
    \ the latent space of a learned implicit (decoder-free) world model. While the\
    \ TD-MPC family of algorithms has demonstrated strong empirical performance in\
    \ prior work (Hansen et al., 2022; 2023; Yuan et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023;\
    \ Feng et al., 2023; Chitnis et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Lancaster et al.,\
    \ 2023), most successes have been limited to single-task learning with little\
    \ emphasis on scaling. As shown in Figure 1, naïvely increasing model and data\
    \ size of TD-MPC often leads to a net decrease in agent performance, as is commonly\
    \ observed in RL literature (Kumar et al., 2023). In contrast, scaling TD-MPC2\
    \ leads to consistently improved capabilities. Our algorithmic contributions,\
    \ which have been key to achieving this milestone, are two-fold: (1) improved\
    \ algorithmic robustness by revisiting core design choices, and (2) careful design\
    \ of an architecture that can accommodate datasets with multiple embodiments and\
    \ action spaces without relying on domain knowledge. The resulting algorithm,\
    \ TD-MPC2, is scalable, robust, and can be applied to a variety of single-task\
    \ and multi-task continuous control problems using a single set of hyperparameters.\
