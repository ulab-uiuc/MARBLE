  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Node classification\
    \ is a fundamental task in graph machine learning, with high-impact applications\
    \ across many fields such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and recommendation\
    \ systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  [20, 28, 65, 72, 49, 33, 8, 76, 18, 9,\
    \ 51, 4, 73, 56, 10, 52, 53, 66, 77, 37] have emerged as a powerful class of models\
    \ for tackling the node classification task. GNNs operate by iteratively aggregating\
    \ information from a node’s neighbors, a process known as message passing [19],\
    \ leveraging both the graph structure and node features to learn useful node representations\
    \ for classification. While GNNs have achieved notable success, studies have identified\
    \ several limitations, including over-smoothing [35], over-squashing [1], lack\
    \ of sensitivity to heterophily [81], and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies\
    \ [11].   Recently, Graph Transformers (GTs) [50, 48, 23] have gained prominence\
    \ as popular alternatives to GNNs. Unlike GNNs, which primarily aggregate local\
    \ neighborhood information, the Transformer architecture [64] can capture interactions\
    \ between any pair of nodes via a self-attention layer. GTs have achieved significant\
    \ success in graph-level tasks, e.g., graph classification involving small-scale\
    \ graphs like molecular graphs [13, 74, 30, 42, 55, 6]. This success has inspired\
    \ efforts [12, 17, 71, 70, 69, 79, 82, 15, 60, 7, 29, 40, 38] to utilize GTs to\
    \ tackle node classification tasks, especially on large-scale graphs, addressing\
    \ the aforementioned limitations of GNNs. While recent advancements in state-of-the-art\
    \ GTs [12, 71] have shown promising results, it’s observed that many of these\
    \ models, whether explicitly or implicitly, still rely on GNNs for learning local\
    \ node representations, integrating them alongside the global attention mechanisms\
    \ for a more comprehensive representation.   This prompts us to reconsider: Could\
    \ the potential of message-passing GNNs for node classification have been previously\
    \ underestimated? While prior research has addressed this issue to some extent\
    \ [24, 14, 68, 44, 54], these studies have limitations in terms of scope and comprehensiveness,\
    \ including a restricted number and diversity of datasets, as well as an incomplete\
    \ examination of hyperparameters. In this study, we comprehensively reassess the\
    \ performance of GNNs for node classification, utilizing three classic GNN models—GCN\
    \ [28], GAT [64], and GraphSAGE [20]—across 18 real-world benchmark datasets that\
    \ include homophilous, heterophilous, and large-scale graphs. We examine the influence\
    \ of key hyperparameters on GNN training, including normalization [2, 26], dropout\
    \ [63], residual connections [21], network depth, and the utilization of the jumping\
    \ knowledge mode [73]. We summarize the key findings in our empirical study as\
    \ follows:     •  With proper hyperparameter tuning, classic GNNs can achieve\
    \ highly competitive performance in node classification across homophilous and\
    \ heterophilous graphs with up to millions of nodes. Notably, classic GNNs outperform\
    \ state-of-the-art GTs, achieving the top rank on 17 out of 18 datasets. This\
    \ indicates that the previously claimed superiority of GTs over GNNs may have\
    \ been overstated, possibly due to suboptimal hyperparameter configurations in\
    \ GNN evaluations.    •  Our ablation studies have yielded valuable insights into\
    \ GNN hyperparameters for node classification. We demonstrate that (1) normalization\
    \ is essential for large-scale graphs; (2) dropout consistently proves beneficial;\
    \ (3) residual connections can significantly enhance performance, especially on\
    \ heterophilous graphs; (4) GNNs on heterophilous graphs tend to perform better\
    \ with deeper layers; and (5)\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
