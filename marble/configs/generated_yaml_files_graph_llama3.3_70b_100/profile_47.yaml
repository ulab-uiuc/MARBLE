  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to understanding the optimization dynamics
    of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
    My recent work systematically analyzes how learning rate, network depth, and width
    influence the training process. By examining the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian
    of the loss, I have identified distinct regimes in the optimization dynamics,
    including early transient phases, saturation, progressive sharpening, and the
    edge of stability.


    One of my key findings is the phenomenon of "sharpness reduction," where the sharpness
    of the loss landscape decreases during the early stages of training, particularly
    as network depth increases. I have developed a simplified two-layer linear model
    that captures essential sharpness behaviors observed in more complex networks,
    allowing me to uncover the mechanisms behind these dynamics. This model not only
    elucidates the conditions for stability but also reveals intriguing behaviors
    such as period-doubling routes to chaos.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical implications,
    providing a deeper understanding of how DNNs learn and adapt. I am passionate
    about exploring the intricate relationships between network architecture and optimization,
    and I strive to contribute to the development of more efficient and robust training
    methodologies in machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a theoretical physicist specializing in the study of topological
    phases of matter, particularly in the context of fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
    states and their rich interplay with symmetry and quantum computation. My recent
    work has focused on understanding direct quantum phase transitions between chiral
    spin liquids and Z2 spin liquids, where I developed novel many-body wave functions
    that interpolate through these transitions. I have also explored the creation
    and manipulation of non-Abelian statistics in bilayer FQH systems, proposing methods
    to measure topologically protected degeneracies without relying on localized parafermion
    zero modes.


    In addition to my work on FQH states, I have investigated the implications of
    symmetry fractionalization in fermionic topological phases, providing a systematic
    theory that characterizes how symmetries act on anyon content. My research extends
    to the study of anomalies in topological phases, where I have developed methods
    to compute relative anomalies between different symmetry fractionalization classes.


    I am particularly interested in the potential of topological quantum error correcting
    codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. My recent contributions include
    low-overhead implementations of the full Clifford group in various encoding schemes,
    which may pave the way for practical applications in near-term quantum computers.


    Through my work, I aim to deepen our understanding of the fundamental principles
    governing topological phases and their applications in quantum technologies, while
    also exploring the rich mathematical structures that underpin these fascinating
    states of matter.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  One of the most important\
    \ choices to make in gradient-based optimization is the learning rate (step size)\
    \ η\U0001D702\\etaitalic_η. If η\U0001D702\\etaitalic_η is too small, then learning\
    \ may take place too slowly or the model might get stuck in unfavorable regions\
    \ of the loss landscape. If η\U0001D702\\etaitalic_η is too large, training will\
    \ typically diverge. In practice, it is common to pick a dynamical learning rate\
    \ schedule ηtsubscript\U0001D702\U0001D461\\eta_{t}italic_η start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [2, 4, 41, 27]. Modern learning rate schedules for\
    \ deep learning typically consist of a warmup period where ηtsubscript\U0001D702\
    \U0001D461\\eta_{t}italic_η start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is\
    \ increased linearly from zero to a target value ηtrgtsubscript\U0001D702trgt\\\
    eta_{\\text{trgt}}italic_η start_POSTSUBSCRIPT trgt end_POSTSUBSCRIPT over a warmup\
    \ time Twrmsubscript\U0001D447wrmT_{\\text{wrm}}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT wrm\
    \ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [14, 35]. After the warmup period, it is common to eventually\
    \ decay the learning rate, for example via a cosine decay schedule [35, 27, 41].\
    \   Given that warmup is standard in the practitioner’s toolkit, it is important\
    \ to understand it deeply and identify improvements. In modern settings, perhaps\
    \ the earliest work to use warmup was [15], which used a small constant learning\
    \ rate for the first few epochs of training and then switched to a larger learning\
    \ rate. A linear warmup schedule was later introduced in [14]. The intuition given\
    \ was that to scale the minibatch size in SGD by a factor of k\U0001D458kitalic_k,\
    \ it is natural to also scale the learning rate by a factor of k\U0001D458kitalic_k,\
    \ provided the model is not changing too rapidly and successive gradients are\
    \ roughly aligned. However at the beginning of training, the model is changing\
    \ rapidly, so it is natural to start with a lower learning rate and gradually\
    \ increase it to the target value after the network has stabilized.   Other explanations\
    \ suggest that since the network is initialized randomly, the gradient steps at\
    \ the beginning of training are not meaningful, and thus it would be harmful to\
    \ take large steps in such directions [41], so it makes sense to take smaller\
    \ steps early in training. The analysis by [13] suggests that warmup primarily\
    \ limits the magnitude of weight updates in the deeper layers, preventing large\
    \ instabilities. It has also been suggested that the key benefit of warmup arises\
    \ for adaptive optimizers, such as Adam: [24] argues that the variance of the\
    \ adaptive learning rate is large during early training because the network has\
    \ seen too few training samples; it is asserted that this large variance is harmful,\
    \ and that warmup acts as a variance reduction method by allowing the network\
    \ to collect accurate statistics of the gradient moments before using larger learning\
    \ rates. Alternatively, it is also sometimes stated that the initialization may\
    \ start the model off at places in parameter space that are unstable, difficult\
    \ to optimize, and easily lead to divergence, and that warmup can help alleviate\
    \ this [41].   The above explanations are varied and do not clearly demonstrate\
    \ why and to what extent warmup is necessary. A loss landscape perspective was\
    \ given in [11] (and summarized in [27] Ch. 8), which argued that an important\
    \ effect of warmup is to gradually reduce the sharpness (the top eigenvalue of\
    \ the Hessian of the loss), thus\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1.\
