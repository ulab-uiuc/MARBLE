  content: 'This database is designed to manage an e-commerce system with functionalities
    for users, products, inventory, orders, and reviews. It tracks user information,
    including contact details, and stores products with descriptions, prices, and
    categories. The inventory table keeps track of stock levels for each product,
    while the orders and order_items tables handle customer orders and the products
    associated with them. Reviews are stored for products, allowing users to rate
    and leave feedback, and various queries provide insights into sales, inventory,
    and user activity.
