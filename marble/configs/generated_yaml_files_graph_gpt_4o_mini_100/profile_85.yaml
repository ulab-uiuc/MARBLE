  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in the dynamics of wave equations, stochastic
    systems, and the application of deep learning to high-dimensional control problems.
    My work primarily focuses on understanding the asymptotic behavior of solutions
    to wave equations with time-dependent damping and nonlinearities, where I have
    successfully demonstrated convergence to equilibrium states using Lojasiewicz-Simon
    type inequalities.


    In my exploration of acoustic wave motion, I have investigated the stability of
    systems influenced by boundary frictions and random forces, establishing the existence
    of unique invariant measures that exhibit strong mixing properties. This work
    not only incorporates stochastic elements into acoustic models but also highlights
    the controllability of the underlying dynamical systems.


    I have also delved into semilinear wave systems, revealing conditions for asymptotic
    stability without bifurcation or chaos, and have provided numerical simulations
    to support my theoretical findings. My research extends to slow-fast stochastic
    differential systems, where I apply the perturbed test function method to derive
    central limit theorems.


    Recently, I have been developing deep learning-based algorithms for high-dimensional
    stochastic control problems, leveraging physics-informed learning and dynamic
    programming. By introducing a pathwise operator associated with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
    equation, I aim to enhance the accuracy of control solutions while providing a
    comprehensive error analysis. My work is driven by a passion for bridging theoretical
    insights with practical applications, and I continuously seek to advance our understanding
    of complex dynamical systems.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher with a strong focus on mathematical finance, particularly
    in the areas of interest rate modeling, derivative pricing, and stochastic processes.
    My work spans a variety of topics, including the classification of yield curve
    shapes in affine models, the development of innovative hedging strategies, and
    the exploration of hyperbolic geometry in supervised learning.


    Recently, I introduced Hyperbolic Prototype Learning, which leverages hyperbolic
    space to enhance classification tasks through a novel loss function. I have also
    investigated the intriguing phenomenon of W-shaped implied volatility curves,
    demonstrating their emergence from a mixture of variance-gamma models. My research
    on affine forward variance models has led to a deeper understanding of their structure
    and applications, including the Heston model and its rough counterpart.


    In addition to theoretical advancements, I have contributed practical methodologies
    for variance-optimal hedging and the pricing of derivatives based on realized
    variance. My work often employs sophisticated mathematical tools, such as Fourier
    analysis and stochastic calculus, to derive results that are both rigorous and
    applicable to real-world financial scenarios.


    I am passionate about bridging the gap between theory and practice in finance,
    and I strive to develop models that not only enhance our understanding of market
    dynamics but also provide actionable insights for practitioners. My ongoing research
    continues to explore the rich interplay between stochastic processes and financial
    applications, aiming to contribute to the evolving landscape of quantitative finance.'

    \ risk minimization The general framework for training deep neural networks is\
    \ to solve the problem of empirical risk minimization (ERM) min x∈Rd( f(x) :=1\
    \ nnX i=1fi(x)) (ERM) where fidenotes the loss induced by the data point ai∈Rd\
    \ with label/response bi∈R, and fis the empirical risk over the training data.\
    \ For our theoretical and numerical analysis of heavy-tailed phenomena, as in\
    \ Gurbuzbalaban et al. [2021], we assume a quadratic structure of fi(x) with the\
    \ understanding that a smooth loss landscape can typically be well-approximated\
    \ by a quadratic function around a local minimum. Thus, we specify the function\
    \ fiby setting fi(x) =1 2(ai·x−bi)2+δ 2∥x∥2:=Li(x) +δ 2∥x∥2, where Li(x) is the\
    \ unregularized loss on the i-th data point andδ≥0 a regularization parameter.\
    \ This is the same loss function that is used for ridge regression (cf. Hastie\
    \ et al. [2009]). We arrange the training data into a design matrix A∈Rn×dand\
    \ label vector b∈Rn, whose i-th row are given byaiandbirespectively. Thus, we\
    \ have f(x) =1 2n∥Ax−b∥2+δ 2∥x∥2:=1 nL(x) +δ 2∥x∥2 with gradient given by ∇f(x)\
    \ =1 n∇L(x) +δx. 2.2 Stochastic gradient descent The standard approach to solve\
    \ the problem (ERM) is to use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or any of its\
    \ generaliza- tions involving momentum, adaptive learning rates, gradient rescaling,\
    \ etc. (cf. Goodfellow\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
