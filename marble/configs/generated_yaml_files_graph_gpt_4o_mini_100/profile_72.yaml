  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) and
    its applications in sequential decision-making. My recent work focuses on the
    integration of online and offline data to enhance exploration and learning efficiency
    in RL algorithms. I have demonstrated that it is unnecessary to impose coverage
    assumptions on offline datasets, proposing methods like DISC-GOLF that leverage
    offline data to improve online exploration without requiring single-policy concentrability.


    In addition to hybrid RL, I have explored automatic differentiation (AD) techniques
    for partially observed nonlinear stochastic systems, developing new algorithms
    that significantly improve likelihood maximization. My research also includes
    learning mixtures of Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDPs) from short
    unlabeled trajectories, where I achieved impressive accuracy through a novel multi-step
    process.


    I am particularly interested in the intersection of matrix sketching and distributed
    learning, where I have introduced methods that minimize bias in least squares
    estimators, leading to more efficient distributed algorithms. Furthermore, I have
    contributed to the latent bandit framework, establishing its generality and developing
    methods like SOLD, LOCAL-UCB, and ProBALL-UCB to effectively learn from offline
    data and optimize decision-making in real-world applications.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    enhancing the capabilities of machine learning in complex decision-making environments.'

    relationships between electron-phonon interactions and superconducting transition
    temperatures (Tc), where I have developed comprehensive Tc maps in parameter space
    that classify known superconductors and predict new materials with enhanced properties.
    Utilizing strong-coupling Eliashberg theory, I have explored complex crossover
    behaviors in superconductors, shedding light on phenomena such as the pseudo-gap

    In addition to my work on superconductivity, I have delved into the realms of
    celestial conformal field theory, where I reformulated the Riemann zeta function
    and investigated the connections between scattering amplitudes and topological
    properties. My research also extends to Kondo resonance phenomena, where I employed
    self-consistent calculations to understand the nuances of tunneling spectra.

    Passing (AMP) algorithms. I have made significant strides in establishing non-asymptotic
    distributional characterizations for AMP, enhancing our understanding of its dynamics
    in both sparse and robust regression contexts.


    My recent research has explored the intriguing behavior of interpolating estimators,
    particularly the minimum \(\ell_1\)-norm interpolator, revealing a multi-descent
    phenomenon that challenges conventional wisdom about over-parameterization. I
    have also contributed to the understanding of reinforcement learning, demonstrating
    minimax-optimal sample complexity in Markov decision processes, and have investigated

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL) holds great promise in attaining reliable decision-making in adaptive environments\
    \ for a broad range of modern applications. In these applications, typical RL\
    \ algorithms often require an enormous number of training samples in order to\
    \ reach the desired level of accuracy. This has motivated a line of recent efforts\
    \ to study the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. There are two mainstream paradigms\
    \ of RL, distinguished by how samples are collected: online RL and offline RL.\
    \ In the setting of online RL, an agent learns in a real-time manner, exploring\
    \ the environment to maximize her cumulative rewards by executing a sequence of\
    \ adaptively chosen policies (e.g. Azar et al., (2017); Kearns and Singh, (2002);\
    \ Jin et al., (2018); Sutton and Barto, (2018); Zhang et al., (2023)). These online\
    \ RL algorithms often suffer from insufficient use of data samples due to a lack\
    \ of a reference policy at the initial stage of the learning process. Whereas,\
    \ in offline RL, an agent has only access to a pre-collected dataset, and tries\
    \ to figure out how to perform well in a different environment without ever experiencing\
    \ it (e.g. Levine et al., (2020); Lange et al., (2012); Jin et al., 2021b ; Xie\
    \ et al., 2022b ; Li et al., (2024)). Offline methods therefore often impose stringent\
    \ requirements on the quality of the pre-collected data.   To address limitations\
    \ from both cases, the setting of hybrid RL (Xie et al., 2022b, ; Song et al.,,\
    \ 2023) has recently received considerable attention from both theoretical and\
    \ practical perspectives (see, e.g. Vecerik et al., (2017); Nair et al., (2020);\
    \ Song et al., (2023); Nakamoto et al., (2023); Wagenmaker and Pacchiano, (2023);\
    \ Li et al., 2023b ; Ball et al., (2023); Zhou et al., (2023); Amortila et al.,\
    \ (2024); Tan and Xu, (2024); Kausik et al., (2024) and references therein). In\
    \ hybrid RL, an agent learns from a combination of both offline and online data,\
    \ extracting information from offline data to enhance online exploration. The\
    \ theoretical guarantees of hybrid RL algorithms can be categorized based on the\
    \ following criteria: (1) the degree of function approximation considered, (2)\
    \ the level of coverage required by the behavior policy, (3) whether it achieves\
    \ an improvement over the minimax lower bounds for online-only and offline-only\
    \ learning, and (4) whether they attempt to perform regret minimization or to\
    \ learn an ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilonitalic_ϵ-optimal policy (often referred to as PAC\
    \ learning). We elaborate below, and summarize the prior art in Table 1.     \

    \ 2023; Tan and Xu,, 2024; Amortila et al.,, 2024) have explored general function\
    \ approximation in hybrid RL, they either require stringent concentrability assumptions\
    \ on the quality of the behavior policy, or fail to obtain tight theoretical guarantees.\
    \ Under such single-policy concentrability assumptions (explained below), it has\
    \ been shown in Xie et al., 2022b  that the optimal policy learning algorithm\
    \ is either a purely offline reduction or a purely online RL algorithm if the\
    \ agent can choose the ratio of offline to online samples, rendering the benefits\
    \ of hybrid RL questionable. In scenarios where this assumption is not\n\n   \
