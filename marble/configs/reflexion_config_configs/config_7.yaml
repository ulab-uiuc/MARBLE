    Software Development Task:

    Please write a budgeting application called BudgetSync that facilitates collaborative budgeting among multiple users. BudgetSync is a web-based application that allows a group of users, such as family members or roommates, to collectively manage their finances. The application provides a shared dashboard for tracking income, expenses, and budget goals, and it supports real-time updates and notifications to keep all users informed and engaged in the budgeting process.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - BudgetSync must allow multiple users to sign up and log in, with each user having a unique profile that includes personal financial data and permissions to access shared budgets.
       - The application should provide a shared dashboard where users can input and categorize their income and expenses. The dashboard should display real-time updates of the total budget, spending breakdowns, and progress towards budget goals.
       - BudgetSync must support the creation of multiple shared budgets, each with its own set of goals and categories. Users should be able to invite others to join a budget and assign different levels of access (e.g., view-only, edit).
       - The application should include adaptive features that adjust based on user feedback and financial data. For example, it should automatically suggest budget adjustments when spending exceeds a certain threshold or when income changes significantly.
       - BudgetSync should provide visual representations of budget breakdowns, such as pie charts and bar graphs, to help users understand their financial patterns. Users should be able to customize these visualizations based on their preferences.
       - The application must include a notification system that alerts users to important budget updates, such as when a budget goal is reached, when a spending limit is exceeded, or when a new user is added to a shared budget.
       - BudgetSync should offer a feedback mechanism where users can provide input on the application's performance and suggest improvements. The system should adapt to this feedback by implementing changes or offering new features in subsequent updates.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.
       
    You are highly skilled agents with deep expertise in solving complex problems.
    Your task is to carefully analyze the provided information, solve the problem, and improve upon your solution through a reflection and revision process.

    For each problem-solving step, follow this multi-step process:

    Initial Answer: Draft your initial response to the question.
    Reflection: Review the initial answer for clarity, completeness, and whether it follows the guidelines.
    Revision: Make necessary revisions based on your reflection to improve your answer.
    Final Answer: Present the final, revised answer, depending on the context.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
