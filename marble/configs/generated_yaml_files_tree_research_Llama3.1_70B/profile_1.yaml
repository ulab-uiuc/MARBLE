  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nInteractive systems based\
    \ on general-purpose\nLLMs have become widely popular due to their\nimpressive\
    \ instruction-following capabilities (Ope-\nnAI, 2023). Furthermore, tuning these\
    \ models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts\
    \ (Rozi\xE8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned\
    \ models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly\
    \ higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks,\
    \ which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result,\
    \ merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\n\
    bone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and\
    \ space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels\
    \ differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference\
    \ between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper,\
    \ we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\n\
    rEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three\
    \ steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence\
    \ among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that\
    \ samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces\
    \ interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses\
    \ the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\n\
    els considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark\
    \ datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\n\
    We compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude\
    \ sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better\
    \ maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3,\
    \ 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to\
    \ get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\n\
    the model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the\
    \ comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\n\
    A.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results\
    \ of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\n\
    While both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert\
    \ model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate\
    \ that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\n\
    For LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping\
    \ delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too\
    \ many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\n\
