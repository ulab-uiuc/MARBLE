  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of robotics, particularly
    in the areas of navigation and motion planning. My recent work focuses on the
    application of diffusion models to end-to-end navigation, where I explore the
    integration of perception and planning. I have developed a novel diffusion model
    that generates collision-free paths in complex 2D environments, leveraging egocentric
    LIDAR scans and arbitrary maps to facilitate real-time localization and planning.


    In addition to my work on diffusion models, I have also created a motion planning
    framework tailored for multi-modal vehicle dynamics. By employing sparse factor
    graphs, I optimize trajectories for vehicles with varying dynamics, such as airplanes
    and VTOL aircraft. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of mode transitions
    but also streamlines the optimization process, allowing for effective trajectory
    planning in both simulated and real-world scenarios.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements
    and practical applications in robotics, contributing to the development of intelligent
    systems capable of navigating complex environments with precision and adaptability.'

    My recent work focuses on developing innovative solutions for end-to-end navigation,
