  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\n\nRobot learning\
    \ has made inspiring progress in recent years, resulting in robots that can cook\_\
    [1], clean up\_[2], or even perform backflips\_[3]. While the capabilities of\
    \ learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance\
    \ in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in\
    \ many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding\
    \ sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an\
    \ advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly\
    \ dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level\
    \ strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a\
    \ robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion,\
    \ precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks\
    \ to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to\
    \ advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research\
    \ since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since\
    \ and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\_\
    [5], hitting to a target position\_[6], smashing\_[7], cooperative rallying\_\
    [8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\_[9]. Yet no prior work has\
    \ tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis\
    \ against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the\
    \ first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level,\
    \ as depicted in Figure\_1. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known\
    \ and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table\
    \ tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions,\
    \ speeds, and spins (i.e.\_angular velocities) and competitive players must know\
    \ how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent\
    \ weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions\
    \ and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This\
    \ organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where,\
    \ unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to\
    \ decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills\
    \ to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action\
    \ if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we\
    \ propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists\
    \ of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects\
    \ between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of\
    \ table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve.\
    \ Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation\
    \ policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill\
    \ has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning\
    \ the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online\
    \ about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The\
    \ resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding\
    \ its abilities and shortcomings. In turn, a high-level controller, responsible\
