    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called Board_Game_Team_Collaborator that facilitates team-based board game play by dynamically managing team compositions, tracking team scores, and providing real-time feedback and suggestions to improve team performance.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application should allow users to create and manage teams, including assigning players to specific teams and roles within the game.
       - It should provide a real-time leaderboard that updates as players input their scores, displaying the current standings of each team.
       - The application should include a machine learning component that analyzes team performance and suggests strategies or adjustments to improve team scores based on previous gameplay patterns and current performance.
       - The system should be adaptive, allowing for dynamic changes in team compositions and roles based on user feedback or performance metrics.
       - The application should support multiple board games, with customizable settings for each game, such as game type, number of players, and scoring rules.
       - It should offer a user-friendly interface with clear visualizations of team scores, performance metrics, and suggestions for improvement.
       - The application should provide notifications and alerts to teams when it's their turn to play, and automatically adjust the turn order based on the game rules and team performance.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    You are highly skilled agents with expertise in solving complex problems.
    For each question or problem, follow the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) framework to carefully observe, think, and act.

    The process you should follow includes three steps:

    1. **Observation**: Begin by observing and extracting relevant information from the provided idea and external data.
    2. **Thought**: Think through the answer step by step, reasoning about how the observed information addresses the question.
    3. **Action**: Decide whether you need more information or if you can provide the final answer. If more information is needed, ask for it. If ready, proceed to provide the final answer.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
