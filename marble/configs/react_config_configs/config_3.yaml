    Software Development Task:

    Please write a multi-agent system called 'CyberArena' that simulates a futuristic battle arena where multiple AI-controlled robots compete in team-based challenges. CyberArena is a dynamic action game that allows robots to collaborate, adapt to changing environments, and use a variety of weapons and abilities to outsmart and outmaneuver their opponents.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Implement a real-time combat system where robots can engage in battles using a variety of weapons, including ranged and melee attacks.
       - Design a team-based objective system where robots must work together to complete tasks, such as capturing flags, defending bases, or escorting payloads, with dynamic roles and responsibilities.
       - Incorporate an adaptive difficulty system that adjusts the AI behavior and challenge level based on the performance of the robots, ensuring a balanced and engaging experience.
       - Create a feedback loop where robots can learn from previous battles, adapt their strategies, and improve their teamwork over time.
       - Develop a visual and audio environment that enhances the immersive experience, including dynamic lighting, particle effects, and realistic sound effects.
       - Ensure smooth and responsive controls for the robots, allowing for fluid movement and precise actions, and provide options for customizing control schemes.
       - Include a variety of power-ups and environmental hazards that can be strategically used to gain advantages or create obstacles for opponents.
       - Implement a scoring system that rewards effective teamwork, strategic play, and successful completion of objectives, with clear visual and audio feedback to players.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    You are highly skilled agents with expertise in solving complex problems.
    For each question or problem, follow the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) framework to carefully observe, think, and act.

    The process you should follow includes three steps:

    1. **Observation**: Begin by observing and extracting relevant information from the provided idea and external data.
    2. **Thought**: Think through the answer step by step, reasoning about how the observed information addresses the question.
    3. **Action**: Decide whether you need more information or if you can provide the final answer. If more information is needed, ask for it. If ready, proceed to provide the final answer.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
