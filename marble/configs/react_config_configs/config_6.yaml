    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called MultiAgentBudgetOptimizer that helps multiple users collaboratively manage and optimize their shared budget. MultiAgentBudgetOptimizer is a software application that allows multiple users to input their expenses, set budget limits, and collaboratively optimize their spending to meet financial goals.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should support multiple user accounts, each with the ability to input their expenses, view their budget, and see the overall financial status of the group.
       - The application should provide a dashboard that displays a summary of the group's total expenses, remaining budget, and individual contributions.
       - The system should include a feature for setting and adjusting budget limits for different categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, utilities).
       - The program should implement a collaborative optimization feature that suggests ways to reduce expenses or reallocate funds to meet the group's financial goals.
       - The application should include comprehensive test cases to validate the following scenarios: inputting expenses, setting and adjusting budgets, displaying financial summaries, and optimizing spending. Test cases should cover both typical use cases and edge cases, such as handling invalid inputs, exceeding budget limits, and managing multiple users with different spending patterns.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    You are highly skilled agents with expertise in solving complex problems.
    For each question or problem, follow the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) framework to carefully observe, think, and act.

    The process you should follow includes three steps:

    1. **Observation**: Begin by observing and extracting relevant information from the provided idea and external data.
    2. **Thought**: Think through the answer step by step, reasoning about how the observed information addresses the question.
    3. **Action**: Decide whether you need more information or if you can provide the final answer. If more information is needed, ask for it. If ready, proceed to provide the final answer.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
