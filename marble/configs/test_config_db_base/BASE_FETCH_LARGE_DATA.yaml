    Recently, during operation, the database monitoring system has triggered an alert. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and query the RAG system to get related information, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA,CORRELATED_SUBQUERY', 'POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.

    Please make the decision after exploring all rootcauses, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.
    Please choose the most likely cause of the database anomaly from the following list, based on the expert agents: 
    'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA'
    You can ONLY CHOOSE two.
    You have access to the Database, and you can perform queries to get the required information.
    These tables include:
    - `pg_stat_statements` (for detailed query stats)
    - `pg_locks` (for lock waits and contention)
    - `pg_stat_user_indexes` (for index usage)
    - `pg_indexes` (for index definitions)
    - `pg_stat_all_tables` (detailed statistics about vacuuming, auto vacuuming, and analyze operations for each table)
    - `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` (for vacuum progress)
    - `pg_stat_user_tables` (for dead tuples and vacuum stats)
    You can also get the failed queries from the database logs.
