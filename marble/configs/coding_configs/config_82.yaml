    Software Development Task:

    Please write a social networking application called CollaborateCraft that connects individuals passionate about crafting and DIY projects. CollaborateCraft is a social networking application that enables users to create profiles, share their projects, collaborate on group projects, and provide feedback and support to others within the community.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application should allow users to create profiles, including a username, bio, and profile picture.
       - Users should be able to post photos, videos, and descriptions of their crafting projects, which can be tagged with relevant categories (e.g., knitting, woodworking, painting).
       - The application should support the creation of group projects where multiple users can collaborate. Each group project should have a project leader who can invite other users to join, assign tasks, and track progress.
       - Users should be able to comment on and provide feedback on posts and group projects. The application should support upvoting and downvoting of comments to highlight helpful feedback.
       - The application should include a messaging system that allows users to communicate privately and within group projects.
       - The application should have a search function that allows users to find other users, projects, and group projects based on keywords, tags, and user profiles.
       - Comprehensive test cases should be provided, including input scenarios such as creating a profile, posting a project, joining a group project, leaving a comment, sending a private message, and searching for content. Expected outputs for each scenario should be clearly defined.
       - Edge cases to be validated include handling invalid inputs (e.g., empty fields, invalid image uploads), managing large numbers of users and projects, and ensuring data consistency and integrity in group projects.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
