    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called SmartRoutePlanner. SmartRoutePlanner is a multi-agent system that dynamically plans and optimizes routes for multiple users based on real-time traffic conditions, user preferences, and collaborative input from other users. The system aims to minimize travel time and optimize the use of various modes of transportation, including public transport, private vehicles, and walking.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The system should support multiple users simultaneously, allowing them to input their starting locations, destinations, and preferred modes of transportation.
       - The system should dynamically update routes in real-time based on current traffic conditions, including congestion, accidents, and road closures.
       - The system should allow users to provide feedback on their current route, which can be used to adjust the routes for other users in real-time.
       - The system should incorporate a collaborative feature where users can share their travel plans and preferences, enabling the system to optimize routes for groups of users traveling to similar destinations.
       - The system should provide multiple route options for each user, including the fastest route, the most cost-effective route, and the most eco-friendly route.
       - The system should have a user-friendly interface that displays real-time traffic updates, estimated travel times, and route options visually.
       - The system should be able to handle and adapt to a large number of users and varying traffic conditions without significant performance degradation.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
