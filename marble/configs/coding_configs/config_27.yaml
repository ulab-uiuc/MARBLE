    Software Development Task:

    Please write a graphics application called CollaborativeDesignSuite. CollaborativeDesignSuite is a multi-agent collaborative design tool that enables a team of designers to work together on a shared digital canvas, allowing them to create, edit, and manage graphic design projects in real-time. The application includes features for drawing shapes, applying textures, and organizing design elements, with a focus on seamless collaboration and dependency management.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - 1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Implement a user registration and authentication system to allow multiple designers to create accounts and log into the application. This must be completed before any collaborative features can be used.
       - 2. **Real-Time Collaboration Canvas**: Develop a shared digital canvas where multiple designers can simultaneously draw, edit, and manipulate design elements. The canvas should support real-time updates, ensuring that all changes are visible to all participants. This feature depends on the completion of the user registration and authentication system.
       - 3. **Shape and Texture Tools**: Integrate a set of tools for creating and editing geometric shapes and applying custom textures. These tools should be accessible within the collaboration canvas and must be functional before users can start designing.
       - 4. **Element Management and Organization**: Implement features for aligning, grouping, and arranging design elements within the canvas. Users should be able to organize their work efficiently, and these features depend on the shape and texture tools being fully operational.
       - 5. **Annotation and Commenting System**: Develop a system for annotating and commenting on design elements. Users should be able to add notes, suggestions, and feedback directly on the canvas, which will enhance collaboration. This feature depends on the real-time collaboration canvas being available.
       - 6. **Dependency Management**: Ensure that certain tasks within the application are dependent on the completion of others. For example, users should not be able to apply textures until shapes are created, and annotations should only be available once the collaboration canvas is active.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
