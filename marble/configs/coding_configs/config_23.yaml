    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called FamilyAdventureQuest. FamilyAdventureQuest is a collaborative game and learning platform designed to engage children and their families in educational and fun activities. The application combines elements of adventure gaming, educational content, and family collaboration to create a unique and interactive experience. Users can create and manage family profiles, embark on themed quests, and complete tasks that promote learning in various subjects such as science, math, and language arts.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application should have a frontend interface that is user-friendly and visually appealing, with features for creating and managing family profiles, selecting quests, and tracking progress. The frontend should be responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
       - The backend should handle user authentication, data storage, and quest management. It should support real-time updates and notifications to keep all family members informed of their progress and upcoming activities. The backend should also provide analytics and reporting features for parents to monitor their children's learning and engagement.
       - The application should include a database to store user data, quest details, and progress records. The database should be scalable and secure, with robust backup and recovery mechanisms. The database should support efficient querying and data retrieval to ensure a smooth user experience.
       - The frontend and backend should communicate seamlessly using RESTful APIs. The APIs should be well-documented and secure, with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.
       - The application should include a content management system (CMS) for administrators to create and update quests, educational content, and challenges. The CMS should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing for the easy addition of multimedia elements such as images, videos, and interactive quizzes.
       - The application should offer a variety of quests and activities that are age-appropriate and aligned with educational standards. Each quest should have a clear objective, step-by-step instructions, and rewards for completion to motivate and engage children.
       - The application should provide a social component where families can share their achievements, tips, and experiences with other families using the platform. This feature should include moderation tools to ensure a safe and positive community environment.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
