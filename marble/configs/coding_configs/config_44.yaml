    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called CodeSync that enables multiple software developers to collaborate in real-time on a shared digital notebook, specifically designed for writing, testing, and sharing code snippets. CodeSync is a collaborative coding notebook that allows developers to create, edit, and manage code snippets and notes in real-time, with features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and version control.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - CodeSync must support real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit the same notebook simultaneously.
       - The application should provide syntax highlighting for at least the following programming languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
       - CodeSync must include a code completion feature that suggests code snippets and keywords as developers type.
       - The application should have a version control system that tracks changes made by each user, allowing users to revert to previous versions of a code snippet or note.
       - CodeSync must support the creation of private and public notebooks, with access control for private notebooks.
       - The application should provide a search functionality that allows users to search for specific code snippets or notes within the notebook.
       - Comprehensive test cases must be provided to validate the real-time collaboration feature, including scenarios where multiple users edit the same code snippet simultaneously, and edge cases such as network disconnections and reconnections.
       - Test cases should also cover the syntax highlighting and code completion features, ensuring that they work correctly for the supported programming languages.
       - Version control test cases should include scenarios where users revert to previous versions, merge changes, and handle conflicts.
       - Access control and search functionality should be thoroughly tested, including edge cases where users attempt to access private notebooks without proper permissions.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
