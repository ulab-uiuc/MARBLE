    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software system called Cultural_Journey that provides an interactive and educational experience for users to explore different cultures through a combination of quizzes, puzzles, and recipe exploration. Cultural_Journey is a comprehensive system that integrates various cultural elements into a single platform, allowing users to deepen their understanding of different traditions, customs, and cuisines from around the world.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - 1. **Quiz Module Development**: Develop a quiz module that includes multiple-choice questions about cultural traditions, customs, and festivals. This module should be the first to be completed as it provides the foundational knowledge required for the other modules.
       - 2. **Puzzle Module Development**: Once the Quiz Module is complete, develop a puzzle module that features cultural scenes and elements. Users should solve puzzles by matching pieces that represent different aspects of a culture, such as traditional clothing, landmarks, and animals. The Quiz Module will provide the necessary cultural context for the puzzles.
       - 3. **Recipe Module Development**: After the Puzzle Module is ready, create a recipe module that allows users to explore traditional dishes from different cultures. This module should include step-by-step instructions, ingredient lists, cooking tips, and cultural insights. The Quiz and Puzzle Modules will have prepared users with the necessary cultural background to appreciate the culinary practices.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
