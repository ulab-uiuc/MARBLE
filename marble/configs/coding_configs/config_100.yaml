    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called VideoCollaborationSuite. VideoCollaborationSuite is a collaborative video editing application that allows multiple users to work together on a video project in real-time. It provides tools for trimming, synchronizing subtitles, and adjusting playback speed, and supports real-time communication and feedback among team members.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application must support multiple users editing a video simultaneously, with real-time updates and synchronization of changes.
       - It should include a feature for automatic subtitle synchronization, allowing users to upload a video and subtitle file, and automatically align the subtitles with the video content. Users should be able to manually adjust the synchronization if needed.
       - The application must provide a playback speed adjustment tool, allowing users to change the speed of the video playback for precise editing and review.
       - The system should include a chat feature for real-time communication among users, enabling them to discuss and coordinate their editing activities.
       - The application should support version control, allowing users to save different versions of the video and revert to previous states if necessary.
       - The system should dynamically adapt to user feedback, such as suggestions for subtitle adjustments or playback speed changes, and allow for seamless collaboration and iterative improvements.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
