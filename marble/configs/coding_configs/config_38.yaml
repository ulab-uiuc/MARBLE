    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software system called HealthHub that integrates symptom tracking, condition monitoring, and personalized recommendations for users to manage their health effectively. HealthHub is a comprehensive medical management system that allows users to log their symptoms, track their medical conditions, and receive personalized health insights and recommendations based on their data.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Frontend: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to log their symptoms, including severity and duration, and view their health data in a clear and organized manner. The interface should also provide visualizations of symptom trends over time and allow users to set reminders for symptom logging.
       - Backend: Implement a robust backend system that securely stores user data and processes it to generate insights and recommendations. The backend should support real-time data synchronization between the frontend and the database, and include features for data validation and error handling.
       - Database: Design a scalable and secure database schema to store user profiles, symptom logs, and medical condition data. The database should support efficient querying and data retrieval to ensure smooth user experience and accurate data analysis.
       - Recommendation Engine: Integrate a recommendation engine that uses machine learning algorithms to provide users with personalized health insights and recommendations based on their symptom logs and medical history. The engine should be capable of identifying patterns and potential triggers, and suggest actions to improve health outcomes.
       - Collaboration: Ensure seamless collaboration between the frontend, backend, and database components. The frontend should send data to the backend for processing and storage, and the backend should communicate with the database to retrieve and update user information. The recommendation engine should work in conjunction with the backend to generate and deliver personalized insights to the frontend.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
