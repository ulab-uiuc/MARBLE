    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called MultiAgentDine that facilitates the coordination and collaboration between multiple restaurant delivery agents to optimize order delivery times and enhance user experience. MultiAgentDine is a distributed system that enables multiple delivery agents to communicate and coordinate their delivery schedules, ensuring efficient and timely delivery of food orders from various restaurants to customers.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Implement a communication protocol that allows delivery agents to share real-time information about their current location, delivery status, and availability.
       - Develop a coordination algorithm that can dynamically assign delivery tasks to the most suitable agent based on proximity, availability, and current load.
       - Create a user interface for restaurant staff to submit orders and track the status of deliveries in real-time.
       - Design a system for customers to place orders and receive updates on their delivery status, including estimated delivery times.
       - Ensure the system supports the handling of multiple orders from different restaurants, with each order being assigned to the most appropriate delivery agent.
       - Provide comprehensive test cases that cover various scenarios, including single-agent deliveries, multi-agent coordination, and edge cases such as agent unavailability or delayed orders.
       - Test cases should include input scenarios for order placement, agent assignments, and delivery status updates, with expected outputs for each scenario.
       - Edge cases to validate should include handling of simultaneous order placements, agent failures, and unexpected changes in delivery conditions (e.g., traffic delays, restaurant delays).


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
