    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called Notebook_CollabSketch. Notebook_CollabSketch is a collaborative digital notebook designed for sketching, drawing, and annotating ideas, with a focus on real-time collaboration and adaptive features based on user interactions and feedback.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application should allow multiple users to collaborate in real-time on a single notebook, enabling them to draw, sketch, and annotate simultaneously.
       - It should provide a variety of drawing tools, including brushes, pens, and markers, with adjustable sizes and colors. Users should be able to create and switch between multiple pages within the notebook.
       - The application should include adaptive features that adjust based on user interactions, such as automatically saving changes, suggesting color and tool options based on the context, and providing real-time feedback on drawing accuracy and style.
       - The system should allow users to leave comments and annotations on each other's sketches, with the ability to tag specific sections or elements for discussion.
       - The application should support different user roles (e.g., viewer, editor, admin) with corresponding permissions, and it should provide a history of changes for each page, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.
       - The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and modern design that supports seamless collaboration and creative expression.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
