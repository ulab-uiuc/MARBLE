    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called 'WellnessJourney' that helps users create and follow a comprehensive wellness plan combining diet, exercise, and mental health activities. WellnessJourney is a multi-agent system that includes a Diet Planner, an Exercise Coach, and a Mental Health Guide. Each component must interact seamlessly to provide a personalized and holistic wellness experience for the user.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The Diet Planner must be developed first to allow users to input their dietary preferences, restrictions, and goals. It should generate a weekly meal plan and track nutritional intake.
       - The Exercise Coach should be developed next, using the dietary information from the Diet Planner to create a balanced workout plan that complements the user's diet. It should include video demonstrations and personalized workout schedules.
       - The Mental Health Guide should be the final component, integrating data from both the Diet Planner and Exercise Coach to provide mental health activities and mindfulness exercises that enhance the user's overall wellness. It should include features like mood tracking, guided meditations, and stress management tips.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
