    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called Team_Collaboration_Manager. Team_Collaboration_Manager is a business software application that facilitates collaboration among team members by providing tools for task management, communication, and performance tracking. It allows teams to create and assign tasks, set deadlines, track progress, and evaluate performance, all within a single, integrated platform.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should allow users to create and manage projects, including defining project names, start and end dates, and project descriptions.
       - Users should be able to create tasks within a project, assign them to team members, set deadlines, and track the status of each task (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).
       - The program should include a messaging system that allows team members to communicate with each other, post updates, and attach files related to tasks or projects.
       - Each user should have a performance dashboard that displays their task completion rate, average time taken to complete tasks, and any feedback or ratings received from other team members.
       - The program should generate reports on project progress, team performance, and individual performance metrics, which can be exported in common formats such as PDF or CSV.
       - Comprehensive test cases must be provided to validate the functionality of the program, including input scenarios for creating and managing projects, assigning and tracking tasks, messaging, and generating reports. Edge cases should include handling invalid inputs, concurrent task assignments, and performance under high load conditions.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
