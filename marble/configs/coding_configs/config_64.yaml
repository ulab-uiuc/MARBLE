    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called 'QuestHub' that integrates quest management, skill planning, and real-time collaboration for role-playing game players. QuestHub is a comprehensive system that allows players to manage quests, plan character skills, and collaborate with other players in real-time, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Frontend: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows players to create, update, and complete quests. The interface should also support the creation and management of character skill plans. Implement real-time collaboration features that enable multiple players to work together on the same quest or skill plan.
       - Backend: Design and implement a robust backend system that handles user authentication, data storage, and real-time communication. The backend should support seamless synchronization of quest and skill data across multiple devices and users.
       - Database: Create a scalable and secure database to store user profiles, quests, skill plans, and collaboration data. Ensure that the database supports efficient querying and real-time updates.
       - Integration: Ensure that the frontend and backend systems are tightly integrated, allowing for smooth data flow and real-time updates. Implement APIs for data exchange between the frontend and backend, and ensure that the real-time collaboration features are reliable and responsive.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
