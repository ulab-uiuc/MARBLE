    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called Medical_Treatment_Coordinator. Medical_Treatment_Coordinator is a multi-agent system that facilitates the coordination and management of treatment plans for patients with chronic diseases. It integrates the capabilities of multiple agents to provide personalized treatment recommendations, monitor patient progress, and adapt treatment plans based on real-time data and user feedback.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The system should support the creation of personalized treatment plans for patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic heart disease. These plans should include medication schedules, dietary recommendations, and exercise routines.
       - The system must include a multi-agent architecture where different agents handle specific tasks: one agent for symptom analysis, another for treatment recommendation, and a third for monitoring patient progress and adjusting the treatment plan as needed.
       - The system should be able to dynamically adapt treatment plans based on patient feedback, real-time health data, and the latest medical research. This includes the ability to modify medication dosages, suggest additional tests, or recommend specialist referrals.
       - The system should provide a user-friendly interface for patients to input their symptoms, track their progress, and receive regular updates and reminders about their treatment plan. It should also allow healthcare providers to review patient data and make adjustments to the treatment plan as necessary.
       - The system should ensure data privacy and security, complying with relevant healthcare regulations and standards, such as HIPAA in the United States.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
