    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called Multi-Agent City Planner that simulates the collaborative planning and management of a futuristic city. Multi-Agent City Planner is a simulation game software that enables multiple AI agents to work together to design, build, and manage a sustainable and efficient city. The agents must coordinate to allocate resources, construct buildings, manage traffic, and ensure the well-being of the city's inhabitants.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should support multiple AI agents, each with distinct roles such as urban planner, resource manager, construction supervisor, and public service coordinator.
       - Agents must communicate and collaborate to make decisions on city layout, resource allocation, and construction priorities. The system should include a communication protocol that allows agents to exchange information and coordinate their actions.
       - The program should include a simulation environment where the city can be visualized and the effects of the agents' decisions can be observed over time.
       - Test cases should validate the following scenarios: successful communication between agents, efficient resource allocation, timely completion of construction projects, and maintenance of a balanced city ecosystem.
       - Edge cases to consider include handling resource shortages, managing unexpected events (e.g., natural disasters), and resolving conflicts between agents.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
