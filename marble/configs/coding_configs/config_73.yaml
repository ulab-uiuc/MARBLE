    Software Development Task:

    Please write a security application called SecureNet that integrates the functionalities of real-time monitoring, threat detection, and secure data management across multiple devices and networks. SecureNet is a comprehensive security solution that continuously monitors network traffic, detects and mitigates threats such as malware and unauthorized access, and ensures the secure storage and management of sensitive data.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - SecureNet should include a real-time monitoring module that tracks network traffic and logs all activity, including data packets, connections, and user interactions.
       - The application must implement an advanced threat detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to identify and alert on suspicious activities, such as malware infections, unauthorized access attempts, and data exfiltration attempts.
       - SecureNet should provide a secure data management feature that encrypts all stored data, manages user access permissions, and ensures compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
       - The application should have a user-friendly interface that displays real-time alerts, logs, and security reports, and allows users to configure security policies and settings.
       - Develop comprehensive test cases to validate the functionality of SecureNet, including input scenarios such as normal network traffic, simulated malware attacks, and unauthorized access attempts.
       - Test edge cases such as high network traffic loads, simultaneous access from multiple devices, and unexpected system interruptions to ensure the application remains stable and responsive.
       - Expected outputs for the test cases should include accurate detection of threats, proper logging of all activities, and secure handling of data, with no unauthorized access or data leaks.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
