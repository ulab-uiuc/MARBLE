    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called AstroSim, which simulates and visualizes astronomical phenomena such as planetary orbits, stellar evolution, and galactic dynamics. AstroSim is a comprehensive simulation tool that allows users to input parameters for celestial bodies and environmental conditions, and observe the resulting simulations in real-time. The application also provides educational content and interactive features to enhance user understanding of complex astronomical concepts.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application must have a module for defining and inputting parameters for celestial bodies, including mass, radius, and initial position and velocity. This module must be completed before any simulations can be run.
       - A simulation engine must be developed to handle the physics of celestial mechanics, including gravitational forces, orbital dynamics, and collision detection. This engine is dependent on the input module and must be completed before the visualization and educational content modules can be integrated.
       - A visualization component must be implemented to display the simulation results in 3D, with options to adjust the view, zoom, and time scale. This component is dependent on the simulation engine and should be designed to provide an intuitive and interactive user experience.
       - An educational content module must be created to provide users with background information, explanations, and interactive quizzes related to the astronomical phenomena being simulated. This module is dependent on the visualization component to ensure that the educational content is contextually relevant to the user's current simulation.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
