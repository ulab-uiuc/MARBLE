    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software system called CollaborativeTravelPlanner that facilitates the planning of group travel itineraries by integrating individual preferences and coordinating among multiple agents. CollaborativeTravelPlanner is a distributed system that allows multiple users to input their travel preferences and interests, and it generates a cohesive itinerary that maximizes group satisfaction while ensuring logistical feasibility.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - 1. User Registration and Profile Management: Implement a user registration system where users can create profiles, specifying their travel preferences and interests. This must be completed before any itinerary planning can begin.
       - 2. Interest and Preference Collection: Develop a module that collects detailed travel preferences from each user, including desired destinations, preferred activities, budget constraints, and travel dates. This module must be operational before the itinerary generation process starts.
       - 3. Itinerary Generation: Create an algorithm that generates a personalized itinerary for each user based on their preferences. This algorithm should then integrate these individual itineraries into a single, cohesive group itinerary. The generation of individual itineraries must be completed before the integration process can begin.
       - 4. Conflict Resolution and Synchronization: Implement a conflict resolution system that handles overlapping preferences and ensures that the final group itinerary is balanced and feasible. This system should be activated after the individual and integrated itineraries are generated.
       - 5. Real-time Collaboration: Develop a real-time collaboration feature that allows users to modify the itinerary and see updates in real-time. This feature should only be enabled once the initial group itinerary is finalized and approved by all users.
       - 6. Notification System: Create a notification system that informs users about updates, changes, and important information related to the itinerary. This system should be the last to be implemented and should be fully functional by the end of the development cycle.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
