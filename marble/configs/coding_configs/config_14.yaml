    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called Data_Analyst_Collaborator that facilitates collaborative data analysis among multiple users or agents. Data_Analyst_Collaborator is a software application designed to enable a team of users or AI agents to collectively analyze and interpret complex datasets. It provides tools for data profiling, merging, and correlation analysis, and supports real-time collaboration, allowing team members to work together, share insights, and adapt their analysis based on collective feedback.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should support the import of multiple datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON).
       - It should provide a user-friendly interface for data profiling, including automatic detection of data types, identification of missing values, and generation of summary statistics and visualizations.
       - The program must enable users or agents to merge datasets based on common fields, with options for horizontal and vertical merging, and automatic handling of data type inconsistencies.
       - It should include a correlation analysis module that calculates and visualizes correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman) between selected variables, and allows users to explore relationships through interactive scatter plots and correlation matrices.
       - The application must support real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users or agents to work on the same dataset simultaneously, with features such as shared annotations, comments, and real-time updates.
       - The system should be adaptive, capable of dynamically adjusting its analysis based on user feedback or new data inputs, such as refining data transformations or recalculating correlations.
       - It should provide version control and history tracking for all changes made to the datasets and analysis results, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
