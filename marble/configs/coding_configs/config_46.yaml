    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called OfficeTaskScheduler that helps manage and schedule tasks for multiple team members within an office environment. OfficeTaskScheduler is a task management system that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks, as well as set deadlines and priorities, and monitor the progress of each task.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should allow multiple users to log in and manage their tasks.
       - Each user should be able to create new tasks, assign them to other team members, set deadlines, and priorities.
       - The system should provide a dashboard for each user to view their assigned tasks, including the status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed), deadline, and priority level.
       - The program should include a notification system to alert users about upcoming deadlines and task assignments.
       - The system should allow users to update the status of their tasks and add comments or notes.
       - The program should generate reports on task completion rates, overdue tasks, and task distribution among team members.
       - Test cases should include scenarios for creating and assigning tasks, updating task statuses, receiving notifications, and generating reports.
       - Edge cases should test the system's behavior when a user tries to assign a task to a non-existent user, set a deadline in the past, or access tasks assigned to other users without proper authorization.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
