    Software Development Task:

    Please write a system called VideoCollabEditor that provides a collaborative platform for multiple users to edit videos in real-time. VideoCollabEditor is a collaborative video editing system that allows multiple users to perform editing tasks such as cutting, cropping, and adding effects to videos, with real-time synchronization and feedback mechanisms.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The system should support real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit the same video simultaneously with changes being reflected immediately across all connected clients.
       - Implement a user feedback mechanism that allows users to suggest changes or provide comments on specific sections of the video, which can be reviewed and applied by other users.
       - The system should dynamically adjust to different user roles (e.g., editor, reviewer, owner) with corresponding permissions and capabilities, ensuring that changes are approved or reviewed as necessary.
       - Support a variety of video editing features, including cutting, cropping, resizing, and applying filters or effects, with the ability to undo and redo actions.
       - The system should provide a history of changes, allowing users to track edits and revert to previous versions if needed.
       - Ensure the system can handle different video formats and resolutions, and provide options to export the final edited video in multiple formats suitable for various devices and platforms.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
