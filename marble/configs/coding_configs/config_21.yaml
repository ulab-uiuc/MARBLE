    Software Development Task:

    Please write a collaborative coding game called FamilyCodeQuest. FamilyCodeQuest is a multiplayer coding platform that helps families and children learn programming together through fun and interactive challenges. The platform includes features like a shared coding environment, real-time collaboration, and a variety of coding challenges that can be solved as a team.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The platform should support multiple users logging in simultaneously and collaborating on the same coding challenge in real-time.
       - The system should provide a variety of coding challenges ranging from beginner to advanced levels, with clear instructions and objectives.
       - Test cases should be provided for each challenge, including input scenarios, expected outputs, and edge cases to validate the correctness of the code. For example, for a challenge that involves sorting a list of numbers, test cases should include empty lists, lists with duplicate numbers, and lists with negative numbers.
       - The platform should have a feature to save and load progress, allowing users to return to their challenges at a later time.
       - The system should include a feedback mechanism that provides hints and explanations when a user's solution is incorrect, helping them learn from their mistakes.
       - The platform should be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface suitable for children and adults.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
