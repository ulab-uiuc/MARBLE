    Software Development Task:

    Please write a system called CollaborativeSchedulePlanner. CollaborativeSchedulePlanner is a multi-agent scheduling application that enables a team of users to collaboratively manage and optimize their schedules. It allows users to input their individual tasks, set priorities, and share availability, and it dynamically adjusts schedules based on team feedback and constraints to ensure optimal task distribution and time management.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The system should allow multiple users to log in and input their tasks, specifying the task name, duration, priority, and any dependencies on other tasks or team members.
       - The system should provide a real-time collaborative interface where users can view and edit the shared schedule, and receive notifications when changes are made by other team members.
       - The system should implement machine learning algorithms to analyze user patterns and preferences, dynamically adjusting task priorities and time slots to optimize the overall team schedule based on real-time feedback and changing conditions.
       - The system should offer a feature for users to provide feedback on the proposed schedule, allowing the system to make adaptive adjustments to better fit the team's needs.
       - The system should generate reports and visual representations of the schedule, including Gantt charts and time usage summaries, to help users and teams analyze and optimize their productivity.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
