    Software Development Task:

    Please write a system called CollaborativeShoppingAssistant that integrates real-time product comparisons, personalized recommendations, and collaborative shopping list management among multiple users. CollaborativeShoppingAssistant is a multi-agent system that allows friends or family members to work together to make informed purchasing decisions, manage a shared shopping list, and track budget allocations, thereby enhancing the collective shopping experience and efficiency.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Develop a user authentication and management module to handle user registration, login, and session management. This module must be completed first to ensure secure and personalized experiences for each user.
       - Implement a real-time product comparison engine that fetches up-to-date product information, prices, and reviews from multiple online retailers. This engine should be integrated after the user management module to provide personalized and accurate data to each user.
       - Create a collaborative shopping list feature that allows multiple users to add, edit, and remove items from a shared list. This feature should include real-time updates and notifications to all users involved. The shopping list feature should be developed after the user management and product comparison modules are in place.
       - Design a budget management system that tracks spending and provides alerts when users are approaching or exceeding their budget limits. This system should integrate with the shopping list feature and be implemented after the shopping list functionality is complete.
       - Incorporate a recommendation engine that suggests products based on user preferences, past purchases, and current shopping list items. This engine should be developed last, leveraging the data and interactions from the other modules to provide personalized and context-aware recommendations.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
