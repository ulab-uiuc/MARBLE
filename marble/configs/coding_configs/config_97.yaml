    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called TravelPlanner that helps users plan and organize their travel itineraries. TravelPlanner is a comprehensive travel planning application that allows users to create detailed itineraries, including flights, accommodations, activities, and local recommendations. It also provides real-time updates and notifications to ensure a smooth and enjoyable travel experience.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should allow users to create and manage multiple travel itineraries, including adding and removing destinations, flights, hotels, and activities.
       - The program should integrate with popular travel APIs to fetch real-time information on flights, hotels, and local attractions, and present this information in a user-friendly interface.
       - The program should include a feature to generate a detailed itinerary in PDF format, which can be shared with friends and family.
       - The program should provide real-time notifications for flight status updates, weather alerts, and local events.
       - The program should include a collaborative feature that allows multiple users to contribute to a single itinerary, with permissions and roles to manage contributions.
       - The program should have a robust testing suite that includes the following test cases:
       - 1. Test case for adding a new destination to an itinerary, including validation of the input and the correct update of the itinerary.
       - 2. Test case for fetching real-time flight information, including handling API rate limits and error responses.
       - 3. Test case for generating a PDF itinerary, including the correct formatting and inclusion of all itinerary details.
       - 4. Test case for real-time notifications, ensuring that users receive timely and accurate updates.
       - 5. Test case for the collaborative feature, including role-based access control and conflict resolution when multiple users edit the itinerary simultaneously.
       - 6. Edge cases should be tested, such as handling invalid input, API failures, and concurrent modifications.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
