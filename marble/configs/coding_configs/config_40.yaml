    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called Music_Collaboration_Hub. Music_Collaboration_Hub is a web-based platform that allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on music projects, including creating loops, analyzing chord progressions, and visualizing soundwaves. The application integrates the functionalities of a loop creator, progression analyzer, and soundwave visualizer, providing a comprehensive toolset for musicians, producers, and enthusiasts to collaborate and enhance their music production and analysis processes.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The frontend should provide a user-friendly interface with a real-time collaboration feature, allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously. It should include tools for creating musical loops, analyzing chord progressions, and visualizing soundwaves. The interface should support drag-and-drop functionality, real-time updates, and a chat system for communication among collaborators.
       - The backend should handle user authentication, session management, and real-time synchronization of project data across multiple clients. It should support RESTful APIs for data exchange and WebSocket connections for real-time updates. The backend should also include a database to store user profiles, project data, and collaboration history.
       - The database should be designed to efficiently store and retrieve musical data, including loops, chord progressions, and soundwave visualizations. It should support version control for projects to allow users to track changes and revert to previous states. The database should also store user preferences and collaboration settings.
       - The system should include a music processing engine that can analyze audio files and MIDI inputs to extract relevant data for loop creation, chord progression analysis, and soundwave visualization. The engine should be modular and extensible to support future enhancements and additional features.
       - The application should be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent users and projects. It should be designed to run on cloud infrastructure, allowing for easy scaling and maintenance. The system should also be optimized for performance to ensure smooth real-time collaboration and data processing.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
