    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called NewsCollab that facilitates collaborative content creation and verification among multiple journalists and editors. NewsCollab is a comprehensive news application that enables a team of journalists and editors to collaborate on news articles, verify information, and publish content efficiently and securely.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The frontend should provide a user-friendly interface for journalists and editors to create, edit, and manage news articles. It should support features like real-time collaboration, version control, and commenting.
       - The backend should handle the storage and retrieval of articles, user authentication, and authorization. It should also include a verification module that checks the credibility of sources and information using machine learning algorithms.
       - The database should be designed to efficiently store and manage large volumes of news articles, user data, and collaboration metadata. It should support fast querying and data integrity.
       - The system should include a notification service that alerts users about new comments, changes, and verification statuses. This service should be integrated with the frontend and backend to ensure seamless communication.
       - The application should support secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify articles. It should also provide audit logs for tracking changes and user activities.
       - The frontend and backend should communicate using RESTful APIs to ensure smooth data flow and synchronization. The APIs should be well-documented and follow best practices for security and performance.
       - The application should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and articles. It should be designed to handle high traffic and large datasets without compromising performance or security.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
