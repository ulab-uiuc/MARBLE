    Software Development Task:

    Please write a management game application called ProjectSynergy. ProjectSynergy is a management game that simulates a software development project where players must collaborate to complete tasks, manage resources, and deliver a successful project. The game involves setting up a project plan, assigning tasks to team members, managing dependencies, and resolving issues that arise during the project lifecycle. The goal is to deliver the project on time and within budget while maintaining high-quality standards.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - 1. **Project Setup**: Players must first set up the project by defining the scope, budget, and timeline. They need to create a project plan that includes a list of tasks, estimated durations, and dependencies between tasks. This step must be completed before any other tasks can begin.
       - 2. **Team Management**: Players must assign tasks to team members based on their skills and availability. Each team member must be assigned specific tasks, and players need to ensure that dependencies are managed correctly. This step can only begin after the project setup is complete.
       - 3. **Task Execution**: Players must monitor the progress of each task and ensure that team members are completing their work on time. If a task is delayed, players must reassign or adjust the project plan to keep the project on track. This step is dependent on the completion of the team management phase.
       - 4. **Issue Resolution**: Players must identify and resolve issues that arise during the project. This could include technical problems, resource constraints, or team conflicts. Players need to prioritize issues and allocate resources to resolve them efficiently. This step is ongoing and can start once the task execution phase begins.
       - 5. **Project Delivery**: The final step is to deliver the project. Players must ensure that all tasks are completed, the project is within budget, and the quality standards are met. This step can only be initiated once all other phases are successfully completed.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
