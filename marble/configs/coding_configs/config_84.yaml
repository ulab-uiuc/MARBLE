    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called Sport_Team_Coordinator that helps sports teams manage their training, game strategies, and performance analytics. Sport_Team_Coordinator is a comprehensive system that integrates tools for workout planning, strategy planning, and performance tracking, designed to enhance team coordination and effectiveness.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Frontend: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows coaches and athletes to input and manage training and game data. The interface should support features for creating workout plans, customizing game strategies, and viewing performance analytics. It should also include a dashboard for quick access to key metrics and team performance.
       - Backend: Implement a robust backend system that handles data storage, processing, and retrieval. The backend should support the creation and management of workout plans, game strategies, and performance data. It should also include APIs for integrating with third-party fitness and sports analytics tools.
       - Database: Design a database schema to efficiently store and manage all relevant data, including athlete profiles, workout plans, game strategies, and performance metrics. The database should support real-time updates and scalable data retrieval.
       - Collaboration: Ensure seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, allowing real-time updates and synchronization of data across all components. Implement features for multi-user access and role-based permissions to enable coaches, athletes, and team managers to collaborate effectively.
       - Analytics: Develop advanced analytics capabilities to provide insights into team and individual performance. This should include real-time feedback during training sessions, historical performance tracking, and predictive analytics to forecast future performance and identify areas for improvement.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
