    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called MultiServe that facilitates a collaborative food ordering and delivery system for a network of restaurants and delivery agents. MultiServe is a software application that enables users to order food from multiple restaurants simultaneously, and it coordinates the delivery process by assigning tasks to multiple delivery agents to ensure efficient and timely delivery.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Implement a user interface where users can browse menus from multiple restaurants, add items to a cart, and place a single order that combines items from different restaurants.
       - Develop a backend system that can handle the coordination of orders from multiple restaurants, including sending order details to each restaurant and tracking the status of each order.
       - Create a delivery agent interface that allows multiple delivery agents to log in, receive assigned delivery tasks, and update the status of their deliveries in real-time.
       - Design a comprehensive set of test cases to validate the functionality of the system, including the following scenarios:
       -  - A user places an order with items from two different restaurants, and the system correctly sends the order details to both restaurants.
       -  - The system assigns the delivery tasks to two different delivery agents, and both agents receive the correct delivery details.
       -  - The system updates the order status in real-time as each delivery agent completes their part of the delivery.
       -  - The system handles edge cases such as a restaurant being unavailable, a delivery agent declining a task, or a user canceling an order after it has been placed.
       -  - The system ensures that the user receives a notification when the order is ready for pickup or has been delivered.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
