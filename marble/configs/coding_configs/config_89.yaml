    Software Development Task:

    Please write a turn-based strategy game called Galactic Dominion that allows multiple AI agents to collaborate and compete in building and expanding their empires in a sci-fi universe. Galactic Dominion is a turn-based strategy game that simulates the dynamics of interstellar colonization, resource management, and strategic warfare, where AI agents must adapt to changing conditions and collaborate or compete to achieve dominance.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Implement a game engine that supports multiple AI agents, each with distinct capabilities and resources, to manage their empires, including building structures, researching technologies, and commanding fleets.
       - Design an adaptive difficulty system that adjusts the challenge level based on the performance of the AI agents, ensuring a balanced and engaging experience.
       - Create a dynamic event system that introduces random events (e.g., natural disasters, alien invasions) that require the AI agents to adapt their strategies and potentially collaborate to overcome common threats.
       - Develop a communication protocol for AI agents to exchange information, form alliances, and negotiate terms, which can be influenced by the agents' previous interactions and current game state.
       - Incorporate a scoring system that evaluates the AI agents' performance based on multiple criteria, such as territory control, technological advancement, and economic stability, and provide feedback to the agents to improve their strategies.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
