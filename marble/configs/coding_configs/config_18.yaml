    Software Development Task:

    Please write a system called Multi-Agent Code Analysis and Optimization (MACAO) that integrates code coverage, complexity visualization, and size estimation functionalities into a single, collaborative platform. MACAO is a comprehensive development tool that enables multiple developers to work together to analyze and optimize code quality, coverage, and complexity, while also estimating the size of the project. The system provides real-time insights and recommendations, facilitating efficient teamwork and continuous improvement in the development process.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Develop a Code Coverage Module that analyzes the source code and unit tests, calculating the percentage of code covered by tests. This module should generate a heatmap visualizing the coverage, with color intensity indicating the level of test coverage. This module must be completed before the Integration Module can be developed.
       - Create a Code Complexity Visualization Module that uses metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, and code duplication to generate interactive visualizations. This module should allow users to zoom in and out, navigate through the code hierarchy, and explore the relationships between different code components. It should also provide insights and recommendations for simplifying and optimizing the code. This module must be completed before the Integration Module can be developed.
       - Build a Code Size Estimation Module that analyzes the source code files and calculates the total number of lines in the project. This module should provide developers with insights into the scale of the project, allowing them to plan resources and timelines effectively. This module must be completed before the Integration Module can be developed.
       - Develop an Integration Module that combines the functionalities of the Code Coverage Module, Code Complexity Visualization Module, and Code Size Estimation Module into a single, user-friendly interface. This module should facilitate collaborative work among multiple developers, allowing them to view and analyze all the data in one place. It should also support real-time updates and notifications, ensuring that all team members are aware of changes and improvements. This module can only be developed after the Code Coverage Module, Code Complexity Visualization Module, and Code Size Estimation Module are completed.
       - Implement a Collaboration Feature that enables multiple developers to work on the system simultaneously. This feature should support real-time collaboration, version control, and user permissions to ensure that team members can work together seamlessly and securely.
       - Design a Reporting and Analytics Module that generates detailed reports and analytics based on the data collected by the Code Coverage Module, Code Complexity Visualization Module, and Code Size Estimation Module. This module should provide developers with actionable insights and recommendations for improving code quality and efficiency. This module can only be developed after the Integration Module is completed.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
