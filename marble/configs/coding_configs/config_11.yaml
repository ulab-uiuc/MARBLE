    Software Development Task:

    Please write a web application called CulturalConnect. CulturalConnect is a web-based platform that connects users interested in exploring and sharing cultural content, including literature, music, visual arts, and films, while also providing educational facts about different cultures around the world.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The frontend should be built using React.js and should include user authentication, a dashboard for personalized content, and interactive sections for exploring and sharing cultural content.
       - The backend should be developed using Node.js and Express, and should handle user data, content management, and API calls to external cultural databases and media services.
       - The application should integrate with a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store user profiles, cultural content, and interaction data. The database should be designed to support efficient querying and data retrieval.
       - Implement a recommendation system that suggests cultural content based on user preferences and interactions, requiring coordination between the frontend and backend to process and display recommendations.
       - The application should include a chat feature to facilitate direct communication between users, allowing them to discuss and share insights about cultural content. This feature should be implemented using WebSockets for real-time communication.
       - Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible, providing a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
       - The application should be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) with scalable infrastructure to handle varying user loads and data traffic.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
