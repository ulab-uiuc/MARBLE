    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called `TravelMate` that provides personalized travel itineraries and recommendations based on user preferences and travel history. TravelMate is a personalization system that helps users plan their trips by suggesting destinations, activities, accommodations, and transportation options tailored to their interests, budget, and travel history.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application must allow users to input their travel preferences, including budget, preferred travel dates, type of activities (e.g., cultural, adventure, relaxation), and any dietary restrictions.
       - The system should generate a personalized itinerary that includes a list of recommended destinations, activities, accommodations, and transportation options. Each recommendation should include a brief description, price, and user reviews.
       - The application must provide a feature for users to save and modify their itineraries, including the ability to add or remove items and adjust the schedule.
       - The system should include a test suite with the following test cases: 
    - Test case 1: Input valid travel preferences and verify that the generated itinerary is personalized and includes all required elements. 
    - Test case 2: Input invalid travel dates (e.g., end date before start date) and verify that the system returns an appropriate error message. 
    - Test case 3: Test the save and modify itinerary feature by adding and removing items and verifying that the changes are reflected correctly. 
    - Test case 4: Input a user with no travel history and verify that the system still generates a personalized itinerary based on the provided preferences. 
    - Test case 5: Test edge cases such as extremely tight budgets or very short travel durations to ensure the system can handle these scenarios gracefully.
       - The application should provide nutritional information for any food-related activities or accommodations, similar to the Personal_Cooking_Coach, to cater to users with dietary restrictions.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
