    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called MealMaster that personalizes meal plans for users based on their dietary preferences, health goals, and available ingredients. MealMaster is a personalization software that helps users create balanced and tailored meal plans by taking into account their specific dietary needs, such as calorie intake, macronutrient ratios, and food allergies. It also suggests recipes and provides nutritional information for each meal.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should allow users to input their dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-carb).
       - The program should enable users to set health goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance) and input their daily calorie intake and macronutrient ratios.
       - The program should allow users to specify any food allergies or intolerances.
       - The program should generate a personalized meal plan for the week, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, based on the user's inputs.
       - The program should suggest recipes for each meal, including a list of ingredients and preparation instructions.
       - The program should provide nutritional information for each meal, including calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber.
       - The program should have a feature to save and modify meal plans, allowing users to swap out meals or ingredients.
       - Test cases should include scenarios for different dietary preferences, health goals, and food allergies.
       - Test cases should validate the nutritional information provided for each meal against standard nutritional databases.
       - Test cases should include edge cases such as users with multiple food allergies and very specific health goals.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
