    Software Development Task:

    Please write a program called SportGame_Collaborative_Analytics that facilitates the collaborative analysis of sports game data among multiple agents. SportGame_Collaborative_Analytics is a software application that enables a team of analysts to input, track, and analyze various performance metrics of athletes in real-time during a sports game. The application supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple analysts to work on the same dataset simultaneously, and provides tools for generating reports and visualizations.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The program should support the creation of user accounts for analysts, with authentication to ensure secure access.
       - The application must allow analysts to input real-time data such as player names, scores, assists, and other relevant game metrics during the game.
       - The system should provide real-time collaboration features, enabling multiple analysts to work on the same dataset simultaneously. Changes made by one analyst should be immediately visible to others.
       - The application should include a feature to generate detailed reports and visualizations based on the input data, such as player performance charts and game statistics summaries.
       - The program must include a comprehensive set of test cases to validate the functionality of the real-time collaboration feature, including scenarios where multiple analysts are simultaneously inputting data, updating existing records, and generating reports.
       - Test cases should cover edge cases such as network latency, data conflicts, and user disconnections to ensure the system's robustness and reliability.
       - The application should have a user-friendly interface that allows analysts to easily navigate and interact with the data, and it should provide clear feedback on the status of data updates and reports.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I am better at adding missing functionality based on my decent understanding and compliance to the task description and requirements.
      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
