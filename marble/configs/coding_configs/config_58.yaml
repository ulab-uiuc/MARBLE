    Software Development Task:

    Please write a racing game application called 'Multi-Agent Drift Championship' that simulates a competitive drifting environment where multiple AI agents can race and drift on various tracks. Multi-Agent Drift Championship is a racing game application that enables multiple AI agents to compete in drift races, showcasing their skills in executing precise and stylish drifts while adapting to dynamic track conditions and opponent strategies.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application must support the creation and customization of multiple AI agents, each with unique handling characteristics and drift capabilities.
       - The game should feature a variety of tracks with different layouts and difficulty levels, including sharp turns, straightaways, and obstacles that require precise drifting techniques.
       - AI agents must be able to dynamically adjust their strategies based on the performance of other agents, such as adapting to aggressive drifting or defensive driving tactics.
       - The application should provide real-time feedback to each AI agent, allowing them to learn and improve their performance over multiple races.
       - The game should include a scoring system that evaluates the drift score based on factors such as angle, speed, and style, with the ability to adjust scoring parameters for different tracks and conditions.
       - The application must support a multiplayer mode where human players can compete against AI agents or other human players, with the ability to customize the level of AI difficulty.
       - The game should have a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily navigate through the setup, race, and post-race analysis, including detailed performance metrics and replays.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
