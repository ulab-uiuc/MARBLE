    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software system called CulturalExchangeHub that facilitates collaborative cultural exchanges and learning experiences among users from different parts of the world. CulturalExchangeHub is a web-based platform that connects individuals through interactive sessions, including virtual tours, language practice, and cultural workshops, while also providing tools for users to share and learn from each otherâ€™s cultural backgrounds.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Develop a user registration and profile management system to allow users to create accounts, upload profile pictures, and fill in cultural backgrounds and interests. This system must be completed before any other features can be integrated.
       - Create a virtual tour module that allows users to explore 3D models of cultural landmarks and historical sites. This module should include interactive elements such as clickable hotspots for additional information and audio guides. The virtual tour module must be built after the user registration system is in place.
       - Implement a language learning and practice feature that pairs users for real-time language exchanges. This feature should include a translation tool to assist in communication. The language learning module can only be developed after the virtual tour module is functional.
       - Design a cultural workshop module that hosts live and pre-recorded sessions led by cultural experts. Users should be able to join these sessions, ask questions, and participate in discussions. This module should be developed after the language learning feature is completed.
       - Integrate a user feedback and rating system to allow users to rate and review their experiences with the platform, including the quality of virtual tours, language exchanges, and workshops. This system should be implemented as the final step, after all other modules are in place.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
