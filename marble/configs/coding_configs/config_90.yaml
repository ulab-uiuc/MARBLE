    Software Development Task:

    Please write a strategy game system called 'EmpireForge' that allows multiple AI agents to collaborate and compete in building and managing empires across various terrains and historical periods. EmpireForge is a multi-agent strategy game system that simulates the complexities of ancient and modern warfare, resource management, and diplomatic negotiations, requiring agents to coordinate their actions to achieve strategic objectives and outmaneuver opponents.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The frontend should provide a dynamic and interactive map interface, allowing players to view and interact with the game world, including placing units, managing resources, and engaging in diplomatic actions. The frontend must support real-time updates and smooth animations to enhance the user experience.
       - The backend should handle the game logic, including turn-based actions, resource calculations, combat resolution, and AI decision-making. It must support multiple agents, each running its own strategy and making decisions based on the game state. The backend should also manage game state persistence and ensure that all agents have access to the latest information.
       - The database should store all game data, including player information, game state, historical records, and resource inventories. It should support efficient querying and updating to ensure that the game runs smoothly, even with multiple agents and large datasets. The database should also support rollback and replay functionalities for debugging and analysis.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
