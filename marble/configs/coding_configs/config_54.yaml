    Software Development Task:

    Please write a multi-agent collaborative puzzle game called 'Chain Reaction'. Chain Reaction is a puzzle game that challenges players to strategically activate a series of interconnected nodes on a grid to create a chain reaction that clears all nodes. Players must work collaboratively, with each player responsible for a specific area of the grid, to solve the puzzle. The game includes multiple levels with increasing complexity, a timer to track solving time, and the ability to save progress.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - Develop a grid-based game environment where nodes can be activated by players. Each node has a specific activation requirement (e.g., a certain number of adjacent nodes must be activated first).
       - Implement a multi-agent system where each player is assigned a specific area of the grid. Players must communicate and coordinate their actions to ensure that the chain reaction is successful. Player A must activate their nodes before Player B, and so on, based on the dependencies of the nodes.
       - Create a level generation system that increases in difficulty by adding more nodes and more complex dependency patterns. Ensure that each level has a unique solution that requires coordination among the players.
       - Include a timer to track the time taken to solve each level, and provide the ability to save and resume progress. Also, implement a hint system to assist players if they get stuck.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
