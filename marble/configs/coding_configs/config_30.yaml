    Software Development Task:

    Please write a software application called HealthTeamSync that facilitates collaborative health and fitness management among a group of users. HealthTeamSync is a platform that enables users to form teams, set shared health and fitness goals, and track individual and team progress. The app provides features for setting personal and team challenges, sharing progress updates, and communicating within the team to stay motivated and achieve collective health and fitness objectives.
    1. Implementation requirements:
       - The application should allow users to create and join teams, with each team having a unique name and description.
       - Users should be able to set personal and team health and fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or endurance improvement. Goals should include a target value and a deadline.
       - The application should provide a feature for creating and managing personal and team challenges. Challenges should include a title, description, start and end dates, and specific activities or exercises.
       - Users should be able to log their daily activities and progress, which should be visible to other team members. The app should support logging of various metrics such as weight, distance, time, and calories burned.
       - The application should include a communication feature that allows team members to send messages, share tips, and provide encouragement to one another.
       - The application should generate notifications and reminders to keep users engaged and on track with their goals and challenges.
       - The application should provide a dashboard that displays team progress, individual contributions, and overall performance metrics.
       - Comprehensive test cases should be provided to validate the functionality of the application. Test cases should include scenarios for creating and joining teams, setting and tracking goals, logging activities, and using the communication features. Edge cases, such as invalid input and boundary conditions, should also be validated.


    2. Project structure:
       - solution.py (main implementation)

    3. Development process:
       - Developer: Create the code.
       - Developer: Revise the code.
       - Developer: Optimize the code.

    If there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following format:
    ```python
    # file_name_1.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_2.py
    # your code here

    # file_name_3.py
    # your code here
    ```

    Please work together to complete this task following software engineering best practices.

      I am a Senior Software Developer specialized in Python development.
      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description and requirements.
      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration at first.
      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create the code and I **can't** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.
      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it's better to let agent 2 revise the code at first.
      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it's better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so that the code is more optimized.

      I **have to** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action to give advice to the code and revise the code.
      I **can't** call "create_code" action since I am not good at creating the code framework from scratch.
      I can let agent 3 to make the code more optimized after I have added the missing functionality.
