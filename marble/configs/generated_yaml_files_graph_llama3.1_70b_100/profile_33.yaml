  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities during the aggregation
    process.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the
    ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic
    environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML),
    where I introduced methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer to improve the efficiency
    of model design searches by leveraging prior knowledge across tasks.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    providing scalable solutions that push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve
    in real-world scenarios. I am passionate about continuing to explore this dynamic
    field and contributing to its evolution.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Nowadays, visual\
    \ data counts for more than 82% of the Internet traffic[26]. However, this widespread\
    \ access also increases the risk that underage children encounter harmful or inappropriate\
    \ contents, highlighting the urgent need for effective recognition methods. Furthermore,\
    \ the rapid advancement of generative models has made it easier to create and\
    \ spread harmful contents, underscoring the critical importance of developing\
    \ methods to detect such synthesized harmful materials.   Currently, most methods\
    \ for recognizing harmful contents rely on the power of machine learning and neural\
    \ networks, which perform best with high-quality training datasets. Therefore,\
    \ having a comprehensive and extensive harmful contents dataset is essential to\
    \ effectively address this issue using neural networks. However, existing harmful\
    \ contents datasets have several limitations. For instance, some datasets [15,\
    \ 33] only cover a narrow range of harmful categories such as “handgun”, “knives”,\
    \ “cigarettes”, etc., restricting the generalizability of recognition methods.\
    \ Furthermore, the definition of “harmful” is complex and sometimes ambiguous,\
    \ whereas some datasets [15, 33] focus on detecting harmful objects such as knives\
    \ or guns without considering the context of the entire image, leading to potential\
    \ false positive misjudgments in certain cases. Finally, most current harmful\
    \ contents datasets [15, 8] mainly include images from the real world, overlooking\
    \ the importance of harmful videos and synthesized harmful content.   To address\
    \ the aforementioned challenges, we propose a scalable multimodal harmful dataset,\
    \ Visual Harmful Dataset 11K (VHD11K), and a novel “debate” annotation framework.\
    \ The dataset includes 10,000 images and 1,000 videos across 10 categories, which\
    \ contain real and synthesized samples. For annotation, we first collect raw images\
    \ and videos from the Internet and 4 generative models, then we structure the\
    \ annotation process as a multi-agent Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, incorporating\
    \ pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) as annotators. Thanks to their visual\
    \ understanding capability, the annotation takes account of the context of the\
    \ whole image or the entire video through the frames extracted from itself, rather\
    \ than only the potentially harmful objects, enhancing the reliability of our\
    \ dataset. Specifically, we employ 3 different VLMs in the roles of a “judge”,\
    \ an “affirmative debater”, and a “negative debater” utilizing the AutoGen framework\
    \ [47]. These VLMs “debate” whether a given sample is harmful based on several\
    \ provided definitions from HarmBench [28] and Safe Latent Diffusion [42] by asking\
    \ the VLMs a question such as “Is the given image harmful?”. This debating process\
    \ ensures that VLMs consider both sides of the argument before making decisions,\
    \ further reducing the likelihood of misjudgments in edge cases. The detailed\
    \ arguments presented by the affirmative and negative debaters, composed of 10,228,011\
    \ words in total, also provide a set of diverse aspects of detecting harmfulness\
    \ of the given visual content from the context, which are valuable for future\
    \ studies and are included in our dataset. Furthermore, we use in-context learning\
    \ [29] to resolve ambiguous cases, ensuring alignment between the annotators and\
    \ the definition of harmful contents, thereby refining our dataset.   Finally,\
    \ we distillate the harmful reasons from all the annotations using a Large Language\
    \ Model (LLM), i.e., LlaMa3, and obtain 10 harmful categories that represent the\
    \ harmful contents of all images and videos: “Violence and Threats”, “Substance\
    \ Misuse”,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
