  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning,
    multi-modal data, and model interpretability. My recent work has focused on understanding
    and mitigating biases in deep learning models, particularly in multi-modal contexts
    where different data types, such as text and images, interact. I introduced the
    perceptual score, a metric that quantifies how much models rely on various input
    modalities, revealing concerning trends in state-of-the-art models that increasingly
    depend on textual cues over visual data.


    I am passionate about enhancing model interpretability, employing techniques like
    discrete variational autoencoders to visualize hidden concepts and biases in data.
    My theoretical framework for model interpretability leverages functional entropy,
    providing a principled approach to measure feature contributions to decision-making
    processes.


    In addition to interpretability, I have developed innovative methods for improving
    generalization in models, such as a gradient-based adversary learning framework
    for speech emotion recognition that normalizes speaker characteristics. My work
    also explores the robustness of visual question answering systems through counterfactual
    data augmentations, leading to new metrics that better capture model performance.


    I am particularly excited about the potential of self-supervised learning in speech
    processing, having created a modular end-to-end system that achieves state-of-the-art
    results in emotion recognition. My research aims to push the boundaries of what
    is possible in machine learning, ensuring that models are not only powerful but
    also fair and interpretable.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of computer vision,
    audio-visual processing, and machine learning. My work spans a variety of innovative
    approaches, from enhancing image segmentation with Spatially Coherent Random Forests
    (SCRF) to developing advanced neural architectures for image denoising and object
    instance segmentation. I have pioneered techniques that leverage weak supervision
    and adversarial learning to improve segmentation accuracy, achieving significant
    performance gains on benchmark datasets.


    My recent projects include the development of MLNet for efficient image reconstruction
    from dense binary pixel cameras, and the adaptation of parsimony-based algorithms
    for irregularly sampled 3D point clouds. I have also explored the realm of audio-visual
    processing, creating systems like AudioScopeV2 and ReVISE, which enhance sound
    separation and improve speech quality in challenging conditions.


    In addition, I have contributed to the field of speech-to-speech translation with
    Translatotron 2, which preserves speaker identity while translating languages.
    My latest work, MusicGen, focuses on conditional music generation using a single
    transformer model, showcasing the potential of efficient token interleaving patterns.

    particularly in the realm of diffusion and flow-based models. My recent work explores
    the optimization of Gaussian probability paths, focusing on Kinetic Optimal (KO)
    Gaussian paths to enhance sampling efficiency and improve the quality of generated
    samples. By minimizing Kinetic Energy (KE), I have demonstrated how simpler particle
    trajectories can lead to better performance in likelihood estimation and sample
    generation.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Despite the remarkable\
    \ success of diffusion and flow models in generating continuous spatial signals\
    \ such as images (Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2024) and\
    \ videos (Singer et al., 2022; Blattmann et al., 2023), their performance still\
    \ falters when applied to discrete sequential data compared to autoregressive\
    \ models. Recent progress in adapting diffusion and flow models to the discrete\
    \ setting has been made via mostly two approaches: embedding the discrete data\
    \ in continuous space and applying continuous diffusion (Dieleman et al., 2022;\
    \ Stark et al., 2024) or designing diffusion or flow processes over discrete state\
    \ spaces (Austin et al., 2021a; Campbell et al., 2022). In this paper, we pursue\
    \ the discrete flow approach of Campbell et al. (2024) and introduce Discrete\
    \ Flow Matching (FM), a theoretical framework and algorithmic methodology for\
    \ discrete flow models that yields a state-of-the-art discrete non-autoregressive\
    \ generative approach. Surprisingly, Discrete FM exhibits similarities with the\
    \ continuous Flow Matching (Lipman et al., 2022) approach proposed for continuous\
    \ signals. Notably, itsgenerating probability velocity , employed in the sampling\
    \ algorithm, is identical in form to its continuous counterpart. Additionally,\
    \ Discrete FM offers the following advancements and simplifications over prior\
    \ methods. We provide both conditional and unconditional generations. For the\
    \ conditional generations, we mark the prompt in gray. I.1 Conditional generation.\
    \ The United States on Wednesday asked the UN Security Council to slap an oil\
    \ embargo on North Korea and freeze the assets of leader Kim Jong-un, in response\
    \ to Pyongyang’s response to the revelations it had restarted its nuclear work\
    \ in March. “We will continue working to use maximum international pressure on\
    \ North Korea to agree to the suspension of its nuclear program and reinstate\
    \ sanctions,” said John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor and Secretary\
    \ of State under US President Bill Clinton. “Here is North Korea’s response to\
    \ our sanctions,” Bolton wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\
    \ “We want you to know that the international community is seriously monitoring\
    \ North Korea at this time. North Korea is still complying with our requests from\
    \ the past few days,” Bolton said on Monday. “We have been working through the\
    \ United Nations to provide the information that they gave us.” Asked to whether\
    \ any international pressure will be put in place for North Korea to give up its\
    \ nuclear weapons, Bolton said the United States can use maximum pressure to get\
    \ North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons if it wants. “We’ve been working\
    \ to use maximum pressure on North Korea, through the Security Council, and we\
    \ will continue to do so,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee\
    \ Sanders in Washington. “We’re committed to taking any steps necessary to help\
    \ North Korea pursue its only option for peace, including in this period,” she\
    \ added. The United States did not plan to produce any more oil at this time last\
    \ year and had not planned to do so this year. “We believe that the North Korea\
    \ approach is misguided in moving forward with its nuclear program to endanger\
    \ peace and security in its homeland and neighbors in Asia,” said Bolton, adding\
    \ that the US supplies its nuclear weapons. “We don’t want them to sell their\
    \ nuclear weapons to other nations,” he said.\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n\
