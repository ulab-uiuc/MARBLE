  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of audio processing
    through innovative applications of spiking neural networks (SNNs). My recent work
    focuses on developing efficient, brain-inspired models for audio denoising and
    speech enhancement, particularly in resource-constrained environments like edge
    devices. One of my notable contributions is the Spiking-FullSubNet, a real-time
    audio denoising model that utilizes a novel gated spiking neuron model to capture
    multi-scale temporal information, achieving superior performance in the Intel
    Neuromorphic Deep Noise Suppression Challenge.


    In addition to audio denoising, I have explored ultra-low-power speech enhancement
    systems that leverage SNNs to improve speech intelligibility while minimizing
    computational costs. My research emphasizes the importance of integrating insights
    from human auditory processing to enhance the efficiency of these systems.


    I have also developed the Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron (PMSN), which
    addresses the limitations of traditional SNNs in multi-scale temporal processing.
    This model has shown significant improvements in pattern recognition tasks, outperforming
    existing spiking neuron models in both accuracy and computational efficiency.


    My work aims to bridge the gap between biological inspiration and practical applications,
    paving the way for energy-efficient computational systems that can effectively
    process temporal signals. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of SNNs
    and exploring their potential in real-world applications, contributing to the
    growing interest in neuromorphic computing.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and performance
    of deep learning models, particularly through innovative training methodologies
    that align more closely with biological neural networks. My recent work has focused
    on addressing the limitations of traditional end-to-end backpropagation, which
    often suffers from high memory consumption and performance issues due to its rigid
    structure.


    In my latest publication, I introduced the Hierarchical Locally Supervised Learning
    (HiLo) framework, which allows for a more granular approach to feature learning
    by dividing networks into independent and cascade local modules. This hierarchical
    structure not only facilitates better information exchange between modules but
    also significantly reduces GPU memory usage through Patch Feature Fusion (PFF).
    The results from experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate
    that our HPFF model consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.


    Additionally, I developed the Momentum Auxiliary Network (MAN), which enhances
    information flow between local blocks using an exponential moving average of parameters.
    This approach not only bridges the informational gaps but also incorporates learnable
    biases to further improve accuracy. Our findings show that MAN can reduce GPU
    memory usage by over 45% on large datasets while outperforming traditional methods.


    Through my research, I aim to push the boundaries of deep learning by creating
    models that are not only efficient but also biologically inspired, paving the

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Artificial neural\
    \ networks (ANNs) have achieved remarkable performance in pattern recognition\
    \ tasks by increasing their depth (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015;\
    \ He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017). However, these deep ANNs are trained end-to-end\
    \ with the backpropagation algorithm (BP) (Rumelhart et al., 1985), which faces\
    \ several limitations. One critical criticism of BP is its biological implausibility (Crick,\
    \ 1989; Lillicrap et al., 2020), as it relies on a global objective optimized\
    \ by backpropagating error signals across layers. This stands in contrast to biological\
    \ neural networks that predominantly learn based on local signals (Hebb, 1949;\
    \ Caporale & Dan, 2008; Bengio et al., 2015). Moreover, layer-by-layer error backpropagation\
    \ introduces the update locking problem (Jaderberg et al., 2017), where hidden\
    \ layer parameters cannot be updated until both forward and backward computations\
    \ are completed, hindering efficient parallelization of the training process.\
    \   Local learning (Bengio et al., 2006; Mostafa et al., 2018; Belilovsky et al.,\
    \ 2019; Nøkland & Eidnes, 2019; Illing et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) has emerged\
    \ as a promising alternative for training deep neural networks. Unlike BP, local\
    \ learning rules train each layer independently using a gradient-isolated auxiliary\
    \ network with local objectives, avoiding backpropagating error signals from the\
    \ output layer. Consequently, local learning can alleviate the update locking\
    \ problem as each layer updates its parameters independently, allowing for efficient\
    \ parallelization of the training process (Belilovsky et al., 2020; Laskin et al.,\
    \ 2020; Gomez et al., 2022). Additionally, local learning does not require storing\
    \ intermediate network states, as required by BP, leading to much lower memory\
    \ consumption (Löwe et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021).   Figure\
    \ 1: Comparison of supervised local learning rules and BP on CIFAR-10 dataset.\
    \ ResNet-32 architecture, with 16 local layers, has been used in this experiment.\
    \    However, local learning suffers from lower accuracy than BP, especially when\
    \ applied to large-scale networks with numerous independently optimized layers (Belilovsky\
    \ et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Siddiqui et al., 2023). This is primarily because\
    \ hidden layers only learn representations that suit their local objectives rather\
    \ than benefiting the subsequent layers, since there is a lack of feedback interaction\
    \ between layers. Previous efforts in supervised local learning have focused on\
    \ designing local losses to provide better local guidance (Nøkland & Eidnes, 2019),\
    \ such as adding reconstruction loss to preserve input information in InfoPro (Wang\
    \ et al., 2021). However, these methods still fall short of BP in terms of accuracy,\
    \ especially for very deep networks (see Figure 1).   In this paper, we address\
    \ the scalability issue of supervised local learning methods by strengthening\
    \ the synergy between local layers and their subsequent layers. To this end, we\
    \ propose an augmented local learning rule, namely AugLocal, which builds each\
    \ local layer’s auxiliary network using a uniformly sampled small subset of its\
    \ subsequent layers. To reduce the additional computational cost of auxiliary\
    \ networks, we further propose a pyramidal structure that linearly decreases the\
    \ depth of auxiliary networks as the local layer approaches the output. This is\
    \ motivated by the fact that top layers have fewer subsequent layers than bottom\
    \ ones. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on image classification\
    \ datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011),\
    \ STL-10 (Coates et al., 2011), and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009)), using varying\
    \ depths of commonly used network architectures. Our key contributions are threefold:\
