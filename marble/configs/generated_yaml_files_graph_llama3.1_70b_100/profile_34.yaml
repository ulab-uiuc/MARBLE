  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Figure 1: (a) Comparison\
    \ of different 3D backbones in terms of detection performance on Waymo [49], nuScenes [4],\
    \ Argoverse V2 [59] and ONCE [34] datasets. Here, we adopt Mamba [22] as the default\
    \ operator of our LION. Besides, we present the simplified schematic of DSVT (b) [57]\
    \ and our LION (c) for implementing feature interaction in 3D backbones.   3D\
    \ object detection serves as a fundamental technique in 3D perception and is widely\
    \ used in navigation robots and self-driving cars. Recently, transformer-based [53]\
    \ feature extractors have made significant progress in general tasks of Natural\
    \ Language Processing (NLP) and 2D vision by flexibly modeling long-range relationships.\
    \ To this end, some researchers have made great efforts to transfer the success\
    \ of transformers to 3D object detection. Specifically, to reduce the computation\
    \ costs, SST [15] and SWFormer [50] divide point clouds into pillars and implement\
    \ window attention for pillar feature interaction in a local 2D window. Considering\
    \ some potential information loss of the pillar-based manners along the height\
    \ dimension, DSVT-Voxel [57] further adopts voxel-based formats and implements\
    \ set attention for voxel feature interaction in a limited group size.   Although\
    \ the above methods have achieved some success in 3D detection, they perform self-attention\
    \ for pillar or voxel feature interaction with only a small group size due to\
    \ computational limitations, locking the potential of transformers for modeling\
    \ long-range relationships. Moreover, it is worth noting that modeling long-range\
    \ relationships can benefit from large datasets, which will be important for achieving\
    \ foundational models in 3D perception tasks in the future. Fortunately, in the\
    \ field of large language models (LLM) and 2D perception tasks, some representative\
    \ linear RNN operators such as Mamba [22] and RWKV [37] with linear computational\
    \ complexity have achieved competitive performance with transformers, especially\
    \ for long sequences. Therefore, a question naturally arises: can we perform long-range\
    \ feature interaction in larger groups at a lower computation cost based on linear\
    \ RNNs in 3D object detection?   To this end, we propose a window-based framework\
    \ based on LInear grOup RNN (i.e., perform linear RNN for grouped features in\
    \ a window-based framework) termed LION for accurate 3D object detection in point\
    \ clouds. Different from the existing method DSVT (b) in Figure 1, our LION (c)\
    \ could support thousands of voxel features to interact with each other in a large\
    \ group for establishing the long-range relationship. Nevertheless, effectively\
    \ adopting linear group RNN to construct a proper 3D detector in highly sparse\
    \ point cloud scenes remains challenging for capturing the spatial information\
    \ of objects. Concretely, linear group RNN requires sequential features as inputs.\
    \ However, converting voxel features into sequential features may result in the\
    \ loss of spatial information (e.g., two features that are close in 3D spatial\
    \ position might be very far in this 1D sequence). Therefore, we propose a simple\
    \ 3D spatial feature descriptor and decorate the linear group RNN operators with\
    \ it, thus compensating for the limitations of linear group RNN in 3D local spatial\
    \ modeling.   Furthermore, to enhance feature representation in highly sparse\
    \ point clouds, we present a new 3D voxel generation strategy based on linear\
    \ group RNN to densify foreground features. A common manner of addressing this\
    \ is to add an extra branch to distinguish the foregrounds, as seen in previous\
    \ methods [50, 17, 67]. However, this solution is relatively complex\n\n     \
