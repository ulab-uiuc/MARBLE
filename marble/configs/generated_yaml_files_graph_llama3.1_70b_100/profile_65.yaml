    models and their applications in multi-modal contexts. My recent work has focused
    on systematic generalization in grounded language understanding, particularly
    through the analysis of the grounded SCAN (gSCAN) benchmark. I discovered that
    general-purpose Transformer models can outperform specialized approaches, revealing
    fundamental challenges in systematic generalization that extend beyond visual
    context.


    I have also developed innovative frameworks such as the Concept and Relation Graph

    and guide their development.


    In the realm of object tracking, I introduced Quasi-Dense Similarity Learning
    and Quasi-Dense Tracking (QDTrack), which significantly improve tracking performance
    by leveraging dense sampling of object regions. My work on contextual hallucinations
    in LLMs has resulted in the Lookback Lens, a model that effectively detects and
    mitigates inaccuracies in generated responses.


    Through systematic studies of inductive reasoning capabilities in LMs, I have
    highlighted their strengths in hypothesis generation while revealing gaps in rule
    application. My research aims to bridge the gap between human-like reasoning and

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Recently there have\
    \ been rapid advances in training language models (LMs) to generate code rather\
    \ than natural language (NL), following the intuition that code may be more effective\
    \ than NL for certain tasks, such as those requiring complex calculations, iteration,\
    \ or data structure manipulation(Chen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023). Although\
    \ successful, these works have mostly evaluated on tasks conducive to a programmatic\
    \ paradigm, such as symbolic manipulation or algorithmic reasoning – where a clear\
    \ compilable program can be envisioned. However, it is unclear how to apply this\
    \ approach to “softer” reasoning tasks such as commonsense and social reasoning\
    \ tasks, where algorithmic solutions are less obvious (Zhang et al., 2023a). \
    \  Figure 1: Example from the CoGEX dataset automatically converted from an Alpaca (Taori\
    \ et al., 2023) instance via LLM prompting. We train the model to receive the\
    \ instruction and input and generate the Python program and function call (as\
    \ an intermediate), before outputting the final dictionary that contains the answer\
    \ and any intermediate reasoning steps.     Our goal is to expand an LM’s program\
    \ synthesis skills to such softer reasoning tasks. Our approach leverages the\
    \ insight that as well as synthesizing code, LMs can also emulate the execution\
    \ of code, including emulating function calls defined only by name and documentation,\
    \ but lacking full code implementation. Such pseudo-programs may include both\
    \ well-defined reasoning steps such as math or algorithmic tasks, as well as function\
    \ calls for less precise forms of reasoning, such as commonsense. This work explores\
    \ whether such programs can be generated and pseudo-executed to solve soft reasoning\
    \ tasks as well as traditional algorithmic tasks.   To achieve this, we propose\
    \ a novel approach: training models to follow NL instructions by generating a\
    \ program and then emulating that program’s code execution. Our paradigm, called\
    \ CoGEX, changes the inference process to (1) generate a Python function given\
    \ an arbitrary instruction and optional input, (2) generate a call to that function,\
    \ and (3) produce the result of simulating its execution. Unlike other work (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023), we do not use a Python interpreter to execute\
    \ any code; rather, the model is trained to emulate execution. This allows the\
    \ generated code to deliberately include calls to underspecified functions (i.e.,\
    \ where only the function name and documentation are included), because the LM\
    \ execution emulator is able to speculate on those functions’ behaviors using\
    \ its latent knowledge. We train the model to not only output the result of pseudo-executing\
    \ the code but also the results of intermediate function calls in the code. This\
    \ gives us an improved level of interpretability and systematicity. CoGEX thus\
    \ suggests a way to leverage the flexible ad-hoc reasoning of LLMs as subroutines\
    \ while encouraging programmatic reasoning via the top-level program. We train\
    \ CoGEX models by adapting the recent Alpaca instruction tuning dataset (Taori\
    \ et al., 2023) into a set of analogous Pythonic examples by prompting GPT-4 to\
    \ perform the conversion, and then use the resulting CoGEX dataset to fine-tune\
    \ smaller (7B and 13B) LMs to answer instructions via code.   The CoGEX paradigm\
    \ allows us to explore a new way to learn new tasks: identifying a general program\
    \ that applies across a task, such that new task instances can be solved by emulating\
    \ calls to that one program. Inspired by work on hard prompt\n\n            **Your\
