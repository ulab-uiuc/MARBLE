  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like
    link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    Beyond architectural advancements, I am passionate about understanding the broader
    design space of GNNs. My work on AutoTransfer and FALCON aims to streamline the
    process of finding optimal model designs by leveraging prior knowledge and task
    similarities, ultimately making GNNs more accessible and effective for diverse
    applications.


    Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and
    practical implementations, contributing to the evolving landscape of machine learning
    and graph-based data analysis.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Teacher-Student architecture\
    \ has proved its effectiveness in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) [65, 32, 52],\
    \ which aims to take advantage of a large collection of unlabeled data, reducing\
    \ the expensive costs of annotation [56, 89, 88]. Previous approaches tend to\
    \ model p⁢(student|teacher)\U0001D45Dconditionalstudentteacherp(\\text{student}|\\\
    text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts\
    \ as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior\" to guide\
    \ the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical:\
    \ while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning\
    \ signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns\
    \ from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to\
    \ emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher. \
    \  Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where\
    \ it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they\
    \ will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications\
    \ often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new\
    \ classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could\
    \ enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological\
    \ systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68]\
    \ stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both\
    \ old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent\
    \ GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable\
    \ success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.\
    \   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution\
    \ of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized\
    \ learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic\
    \ between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching\
    \ students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in\
    \ features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large\
    \ discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and\
    \ strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle).\
    \ This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization\
    \ difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative\
    \ learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency.\
    \ Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from\
    \ the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher\
    \ (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without\
    \ proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting\
    \ in confusion and ineffective learning.   Figure 1: Left: Learning effects of\
    \ traditional Teacher-Student Consistency Model (TSCM, e.g., SimGCD [74]) and\
    \ our Flipped Classroom Consistency Model (FlipClass) on Stanford Cars [33]. Middle:\
    \ Model comparison between TSCM and our FlipClass, where \U0001D53Bnewsuperscript\U0001D53B\
    new\\mathbb{D}^{\\text{new}}blackboard_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT new end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ refers to data belonging to new classes. Right: Illustration of the inner feedback\
    \ mechanism in FlipClass, where teacher attention is adapted to the student, leading\
    \ to the alignment of attention.   To sum up, the challenges of previous teacher-student\
    \ models arise from inadequate supervision on new classes and the gap between\
    \ weakly and strongly augmented data. This results in attention inconsistency\
    \ (Chall. III), which leads to discrepancies in predictions and representations\
    \ (Chall. II), ultimately\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
