  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT The sliced Wasserstein (SW)\
    \ distances between two probability measures are defined as the expectation of\
    \ the Wasserstein distance between two one-dimensional projections of the two\
    \ measures. The randomness comes from a projecting direction that is used to project\
    \ the two input measures to one dimension. Due to the intractability of the expectation,\
    \ Monte Carlo integration is performed to estimate the value of the SW distance.\
    \ Despite having various variants, there has been no prior work that improves\
    \ the Monte Carlo estimation scheme for the SW distance in terms of controlling\
    \ its variance. To bridge the literature on variance reduction and the literature\
    \ on the SW distance, we propose computationally efficient control variates to\
    \ reduce the variance of the empirical estimation of the SW distance. The key\
    \ idea is to first find Gaussian approximations of projected one-dimensional measures,\
    \ then we utilize the closed-form of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian\
    \ distributions to design the control variates. In particular, we propose using\
    \ a lower bound and an upper bound of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two fitted\
    \ Gaussians as two computationally efficient control variates. We empirically\
    \ show that the proposed control variate estimators can help to reduce the variance\
    \ considerably when comparing measures over images and point-clouds. Finally,\
    \ we demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed control variate estimators\
    \ in gradient flows to interpolate between two point-clouds and in deep generative\
    \ modeling on standard image datasets, such as CIFAR10 and CelebA1. 1 I NTRODUCTION\
    \ Recent machine learning applications have recognized the Wasserstein distance\
    \ (Villani, 2008b; Peyré & Cuturi, 2019), as a universal effective tool. In particular,\
    \ there are various applications that achieve notable performance by using the\
    \ Wasserstein distance as a component, for example, (hierarchical) clustering\
    \ (Ho et al., 2017), domain adaptation (Courty et al., 2016; Damodaran et al.,\
    \ 2018), generative modeling (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Tolstikhin et al., 2018),\
    \ and so on. Despite its appealing performance, the Wasserstein distance has two\
    \ major weaknesses. The first weakness is that it has high computational complexities.\
    \ As discussed in (Peyré & Cuturi, 2019), the time complexity of computing the\
    \ Wasserstein distance between two discrete measures that have at most n supports\
    \ is O(n3logn). Additionally, the space complexity required for the pair-wise\
    \ transportation cost matrix is O(n2). As a result, computing the Wasserstein\
    \ distance on a large-scale discrete distribution is expensive. The second weakness\
    \ is that the Wasserstein distance suffers from the curse of dimensionality. More\
    \ specifically, the sample complexity of the Wasserstein distance is O(n−1/d).\
    \ Therefore, using the Wasserstein distance in high-dimensional statistical inference\
    \ may not be stable. The Wasserstein distance has a famous alternative called\
    \ the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which is derived from the one-dimensional\
    \ Wasserstein distance as its base metric. The one-dimensional Wasserstein distance\
    \ has a closed-form solution, which can be computed in O(nlogn)time complex- ity\
    \ and O(n)space complexity in the discrete case. Here, “supports\" refers to the\
    \ discrete probability measures being compared. To apply this closed-form solution\
    \ in a high-dimension setting, random 1Code for the paper is published at https://github.com/khainb/CV-SW\

    \ at ICLR 2024 projections are employed, transforming two measures into infinite\
    \ pairs of one-dimensional measures using a projecting function with infinite\
    \ projecting directions that belong to the unit-hypersphere. The closed-form of\
    \ the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance is then applied to pairs of one-dimensional\
