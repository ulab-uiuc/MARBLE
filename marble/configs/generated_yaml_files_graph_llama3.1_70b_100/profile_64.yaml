  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring innovative methodologies in machine
    learning and their applications across various domains. My recent work has focused
    on Generative Flow Networks (GFNs), where I established a clear connection between
    GFNs and maximum entropy reinforcement learning. This breakthrough led to the
    development of maximum entropy GFNs, enhancing their performance in sampling discrete
    objects from unnormalized distributions.


    In addition to my work on GFNs, I have developed a novel method for maximum likelihood
    estimation of path choice model parameters and arc travel time, addressing the
    limitations of previous approaches that treated these tasks separately. My method
    effectively combines data of varying granularity, demonstrating strong performance
    on both real-world and simulated datasets.


    Furthermore, I have ventured into the realm of computer vision, specifically in
    automatic color and pattern detection for carpet retailers. Recognizing the shortcomings
    of existing algorithms, I proposed a supervised approach utilizing a Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) trained on a substantial dataset of over 37,000 images. This
    work aims to improve detection accuracy by considering the complexities of human
    color perception.


    Through my research, I strive to bridge theoretical advancements with practical
    applications, ultimately contributing to more effective and efficient solutions
    in machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of deep learning,
    reinforcement learning, and molecular design. My work has led me to explore various
    phenomena in neural networks, such as the concept of "dying neurons," which I
    have reframed as a resource for structured pruning through my method, Demon Pruning

    and training speed.


    In the realm of reinforcement learning, I have developed Actions World Models
    (AWMs) to optimize gradient propagation for long-horizon tasks, demonstrating
    that these models can outperform traditional methods. My research also delves
    into the robustness of language models, where I found that while larger models
    exhibit some resilience to adversarial attacks, explicit adversarial training
    is crucial for enhancing their defenses.


    I am particularly passionate about generative active learning for molecular design,
    exemplified by my work on LambdaZero, which accelerates the discovery of synthesizable
    molecules with desired properties. Additionally, I have contributed to understanding
    representation learning in reinforcement learning, proposing a minimalist algorithm
    for self-predictive representations that bridges various methods in the field.

    and Myriad, a testbed for learning and planning in real-world continuous environments.
    I aim to push the boundaries of machine learning applications, particularly in
    scientific discovery and real-world problem-solving, while also addressing the
    challenges of behavior specification in reinforcement learning through constrained
    frameworks. My work is driven by a commitment to innovation and practical impact

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Regularized reinforcement\
    \ learning (RL) [Geist et al., 2019] has gained prominence as a widely-used framework\
    \ for inverse RL [Rust, 1987, Ziebart et al., 2008, Fosgerau et al., 2013] and\
    \ control [Todorov, 2006, Peters et al., 2010, Rawlik et al., 2012, Van Hoof et al.,\
    \ 2015, Fox et al., 2016, Nachum et al., 2017, Haarnoja et al., 2017, 2018, Garg\
    \ et al., 2023]. The added regularization can help with robustness [Derman et al.,\
    \ 2021], having a policy that has full support [Rust, 1987], and inducing a specific\
    \ behavior [Todorov, 2006]. However, we show that these methods are not robust\
    \ to changes in the action space. We argue that changing the action space should\
    \ not change the optimal regularized policy under the same change. For instance,\
    \ changing the robot’s acceleration unit from meters per second squared to feet\
    \ per minute squared should not lead to a different optimal policy. While Haarnoja\
    \ et al. [2018]’s heuristic is a step in the right direction, we argue that the\
    \ heuristic does not reflect the structure of the action space, just the number\
    \ of actions, and does not generalize to other regularizers MDPs.   The key idea\
    \ proposed here is to control the range of the regularizer by changing the temperature.\
    \ By not changing the temperature, we demonstrate that we inadvertently regularize\
    \ states with different action spaces differently. We show that for regularizers\
    \ that we call standard, which include entropy, states with more actions are always\
    \ regularized more than states with fewer actions. We introduce decoupled regularizers,\
    \ a class of regularizers that fit Geist et al. [2019]’s formalism and have constant\
    \ range. We show that we can convert any non-decoupled regularizer into a decoupled\
    \ one.   Our contribution is as follows. First, we propose a static temperature\
    \ selection scheme that works for a broad class of regularized Markov Decision\
    \ Processes (MDPs), including entropy. Secondly, we introduce an easy-to-implement\
    \ dynamic temperature heuristic applicable to all regularized MDPs. Finally, we\
    \ show that our approach improves the performance on benchmarks such as the DeepMind\
    \ control suite [Tassa et al., 2018] and the drug design MDP of Bengio et al.\
    \ [2021].     2 Preliminaries  A discounted MDP is a tuple (\U0001D4AE,\U0001D49C\
    ,\U0001D538,R,P,γ)\U0001D4AE\U0001D49C\U0001D538\U0001D445\U0001D443\U0001D6FE\
    (\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathds{A},R,P,\\gamma)( caligraphic_S , caligraphic_A\
    \ , blackboard_A , italic_R , italic_P , italic_γ ) where \U0001D4AE\U0001D4AE\
    \\mathcal{S}caligraphic_S represents the set of states, \U0001D49C\U0001D49C\\\
    mathcal{A}caligraphic_A is the collection of all possible actions and \U0001D538\
    ⁢(s)\U0001D538\U0001D460\\mathds{A}(s)blackboard_A ( italic_s ) represents the\
    \ set of valid actions at state s\U0001D460sitalic_s. If |\U0001D538⁢(s)|\U0001D538\
    \U0001D460|\\mathds{A}(s)|| blackboard_A ( italic_s ) | is not constant for all\
    \ s∈\U0001D4AE\U0001D460\U0001D4AEs\\in\\mathcal{S}italic_s ∈ caligraphic_S, we\
    \ say that the MDP has state-dependent actions. The reward function, denoted by\
    \ R:\U0001D4AE×\U0001D49C→ℝ:\U0001D445→\U0001D4AE\U0001D49CℝR:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\\
    mathcal{A}\\to\\mathbb{R}italic_R : caligraphic_S × caligraphic_A → roman_ℝ maps\
    \ state-action pairs to real numbers. The transition function, P:\U0001D4AE×\U0001D49C\
    →Δ⁢(\U0001D4AE):\U0001D443→\U0001D4AE\U0001D49CΔ\U0001D4AEP:\\mathcal{S}\\times\\\
    mathcal{A}\\to\\Delta(\\mathcal{S})italic_P : caligraphic_S × caligraphic_A →\
    \ roman_Δ ( caligraphic_S ), determines the probability of transitioning to the\
    \ next state, where Δ⁢(\U0001D4AE)Δ\U0001D4AE\\Delta(\\mathcal{S})roman_Δ ( caligraphic_S\
    \ ) indicates the probability simplex over the set of states \U0001D4AE\U0001D4AE\
    \\mathcal{S}caligraphic_S. Additionally, the discount factor, represented by γ∈(0,1]\U0001D6FE\
    01\\gamma\\in(0,1]italic_γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ], is included in our problem formulation.\
    \   When solving a Markov Decision problem under the infinite horizon discounted\
    \ setting, the aim is to find a policy π⁢(s):\U0001D4AE→Δ⁢(\U0001D538⁢(s)):\U0001D70B\
