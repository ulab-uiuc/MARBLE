  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of 3D computer vision,
    particularly through the innovative application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs).
    My recent work addresses the challenges NeRFs face in rendering large-scale, cluttered
    scenes with sparse input views. I developed Clean-NeRF, which enhances 3D reconstruction
    accuracy by enforcing appearance and geometry constraints, effectively mitigating
    common issues like blurry renderings and foggy artifacts.


    In addition to improving reconstruction, I introduced Radiance Field Propagation
    (RFP), an unsupervised method for segmenting objects in 3D scenes using only unlabeled
    multi-view images. This approach allows for meaningful object instance partitioning
    without the need for annotations, showcasing the potential of NeRFs in real-world
    applications.


    My research also extends to the biological realm with CryoFormer, a novel method
    for reconstructing 3D structures from cryo-electron microscopy images. By leveraging
    a query-based deformation transformer, CryoFormer significantly enhances the accuracy
    of capturing flexible regions in biomolecules.


    Most recently, I developed InceptionHuman, a prompt-to-NeRF framework that generates
    photorealistic 3D humans using various input modalities. This work not only addresses
    common pitfalls in 3D human generation but also sets a new standard for quality
    in this domain.


    Through these projects, I aim to push the boundaries of 3D reconstruction and
    segmentation, making significant contributions to both computer vision and practical
    applications in various fields.'

    Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes
    within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction
    and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Cinematographers\
    \ skillfully capture the essence of the 3D world by maneuvering their cameras,\
    \ creating an array of compelling visual narratives [8]. Achieving aesthetically\
    \ pleasing results requires not only a deep understanding of scene elements and\
    \ their interplay but also meticulous execution of techniques.   Recent progress\
    \ of large language models (LLMs) [1] has marked a significant milestone in AI\
    \ development, demonstrating their capability to understand and act within the\
    \ 3D world [28, 29, 88]. Witnessing this evolution, our work explores the feasibility\
    \ of empowering camera control through conversational AI, thus enhancing the video\
    \ production process across diverse domains such as documentary filmmaking, live\
    \ event broadcasting, and virtual reality experiences.   Although the community\
    \ has devoted considerable effort to controlling the trajectories of objects and\
    \ cameras in video generation approaches for practical usage [4, 83, 75, 27],\
    \ or predicting similar sequences through autoregressive decoding processes [34,\
    \ 64], generating camera trajectories has yet to be explored. This task involves\
    \ multiple elements such as language, images, 3D assets, and, beyond mere accuracy,\
    \ necessitates visually pleasing rendered videos as the ultimate goal.   We propose\
    \ ChatCam, a system that allows users to control camera operations through natural\
    \ language interaction. As illustrated in Figure 1, leveraging an LLM agent to\
    \ orchestrate camera operations, our method assists users in generating desired\
    \ camera trajectories, which can be used to render videos on radiance field representations\
    \ such as NeRF [52] or 3DGS [35].   At the core of our approach, we introduce\
    \ CineGPT, a GPT-based autoregressive model that integrates language understanding\
    \ with camera trajectory generation. We train this model using a paired text-trajectory\
    \ dataset to equip it with the ability for text-conditioned trajectory generation.\
    \ We also propose an Anchor Determinator, a module that identifies relevant objects\
    \ within the 3D scene to serve as anchors, ensuring correct trajectory placement\
    \ based on user specifications. Our LLM agent parses compositional natural language\
    \ queries into semantic concepts. With these parsed sub-queries as inputs, the\
    \ agent then calls our proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator. It composes the\
    \ final trajectory with the outputs from these tools, which can ultimately be\
    \ used to render a video that fulfills the user’s request.   With comprehensive\
    \ evaluations and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, our method exhibits\
    \ a pronounced ability to interpret and execute complex instructions for camera\
    \ operation. Our user studies further demonstrate its promising application prospects\
    \ in actual production settings. In summary, this paper’s contributions are as\
    \ follows:   •  We introduce ChatCam, a system that, for the first time, enables\
    \ users to operate cameras through natural language interactions. It simplifies\
    \ sophisticated camera movements and reduces technical hurdles for creators. \
    \   •  We develop CineGPT for text-conditioned camera trajectory generation and\
    \ an Anchor Determinator for precise camera trajectory placement. Our LLM agent\
    \ understands users’ requests and leverages our proposed tools to complete the\
    \ task.    •  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\
    \ showing how AI can effectively collaborate with humans on complex tasks involving\
    \ multiple elements such as language, images, 3D assets, and camera trajectories.\
    \      Figure 1: Empowering camera control through conversational AI. Our proposed\
    \ ChatCam assists users in generating desired camera trajectories through natural\
    \ language interactions. The generated trajectories can be used to render videos\
    \ on radiance field representations such as NeRF [52] or 3DGS [35].     2 Related\n\
