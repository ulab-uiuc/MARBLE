  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning,
    information theory, and game theory. My work primarily revolves around understanding
    and improving the mappings between latent spaces and high-dimensional observation
    spaces. I have explored the concept of simplicity in mappings, proposing a formal
    definition based on information geometry that captures the local discrepancies
    between pullback and intrinsic geometries.

    a semi-continuous latent representation that allows for more sophisticated posterior
    distributions, showcasing significant improvements over traditional models. My
    research extends to the practical aspects of neural networks, where I analyze

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The design of classical\
    \ reinforcement learningÂ (RL) algorithms primarily focuses on the expectation\
    \ of cumulative rewards that an agent observes while interacting with the environment.\
    \ Recently, a new class of RL algorithms called distributional RL estimates the\
    \ full distribution of total returns and has exhibited state-of-the-art performance\
    \ in a wide range of environments, such as C51Â [5], Quantile-Regression DQNÂ (QR-DQN)Â [14],\
    \ EDRLÂ [41], Implicit Quantile NetworksÂ (IQN)Â [13], Fully Parameterized Quantile\
    \ FunctionÂ (FQF)Â [56], Non-Crossing QR-DQNÂ [58], Maximum Mean DiscrepancyÂ (MMD-DQN)Â [37],\
    \ SplineÂ (SPL-DQN)Â [33], and Sketch-DQNÂ [53]. Beyond the performance advantage,\
    \ distributional RL has also possessed benefits in risk-sensitive controlÂ [13,\
    \ 9], explorationÂ [35, 11, 48], offline settingÂ [34, 55], statistical value estimationÂ [43],\
    \ robustnessÂ [47] and optimizationÂ [46, 52, 42, 51].   Limitations of Typical\
    \ Distributional RL Algorithms.  Despite the gradual introduction of numerous\
    \ algorithms, quantile regression-based algorithmsÂ [14, 13, 56, 41, 33, 42, 43]\
    \ dominate attention and research in the realm of distributional RL. These algorithms\
    \ utilize quantile regression to approximate the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance\
    \ to compare two return distributions. Nevertheless, two major limitations hinder\
    \ their performance improvement and wider practical deployment. 1) Inaccuracy\
    \ in Capturing Return Distribution Characteristics. The way of directly generating\
    \ quantiles of return distributions via neural networks often suffers from the\
    \ non-crossing issueÂ [58], where the learned quantile curves fail to guarantee\
    \ a non-decreasing property. This leads to abnormal distribution estimates and\
    \ reduced model interpretability. The inaccurate distribution estimate is fundamentally\
    \ attributed to the use of pre-specified statisticsÂ [41], while unrestricted statistics\
    \ based on deterministic samples can be potentially more effective in complex\
    \ environmentsÂ [37]. 2) Difficulties in Extension to Multi-dimensional Rewards.\
    \ Many RL tasks involve multiple sources of rewardsÂ [32, 15], hybrid reward architectureÂ [50,\
    \ 30], or sub-reward structures after reward decompositionÂ [31, 57], which require\
    \ learning multi-dimensional return distributions to reduce the intrinsic uncertainty\
    \ of the environments. However, it remains elusive how to use quantile regressions\
    \ to approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance, while circumventing\
    \ the computational intractability issue in the related multi-dimensional output\
    \ space.   Motivation of Sinkhorn Divergence: a Regularized Wasserstein loss.\
    \ Sinkhorn divergenceÂ [45] has emerged as a theoretically principled and computationally\
    \ efficient alternative for approximating Wasserstein distance. It has gained\
    \ increasing attention in the field of optimal transportÂ [4, 24, 21, 39] and has\
    \ been successfully applied in various areas of machine learningÂ [38, 25, 54,\
    \ 20, 8]. By introducing entropic regularization, Sinkhorn divergence can efficiently\
    \ approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance using computationally efficient\
    \ matrix scaling algorithmsÂ [45, 39]. This makes it feasible to apply optimal\
    \ transport distances to RL tasks with multi-dimensional rewardsÂ (see experiments\
    \ in SectionÂ 5.3). Moreover, Sinkhorn divergence enables the leverage of samples\
    \ to approximate return distributions instead of relying on pre-specified statistics,\
    \ e.g., quantiles, thereby increasing the accuracy in capturing the full data\
    \ complexity behind return distributions and naturally avoiding the non-crossing\
    \ issues in distributional RL. Beyond addressing the two main limitations mentioned\
    \ above, the well-controlled regularization introduced in Sinkrhorn divergence\
    \ helps to find a âsmootherâ transport plan relative to Wasserstein distance,\
    \ making it less sensitive to noises or small perturbations when comparing two\
    \ return distributionsÂ (see AppendixÂ A for the visualization). The term \"smoother\"\
    \ refers to the effect of regularization in Sinkhorn divergence to encourage a\
    \ more uniformly distributed transport plan. This regularization also aligns with\
    \ the maximum-entropy principleÂ [28, 16], which\n\n            **Your Task**\n\
