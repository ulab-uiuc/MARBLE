  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of multimodal
    large language models (MLLMs) and their applications in visual instruction tuning.
    My recent work introduces Genixer, a comprehensive data generation pipeline that
    empowers MLLMs to independently create visual instruction data without relying
    on external models like GPT-4. Through this innovative approach, I have demonstrated
    that synthetic datasets can significantly improve performance across various multimodal
    benchmarks, showcasing the potential of MLLMs as robust data generators.


    In addition to my work on data generation, I have developed a novel method called
    Salient Channel Tuning (SCT), which optimizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning
    of vision transformers. By leveraging task-specific information, SCT allows for
    the tuning of only a fraction of the model''s channels, resulting in substantial
    reductions in parameter costs while achieving superior performance on a wide range
    of visual transfer learning tasks. My research emphasizes the importance of efficiency
    and effectiveness in model training, particularly in low-data resource scenarios.


    I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of multimodal learning and exploring
    new methodologies that enhance model performance while minimizing resource requirements.
    My work not only contributes to the academic community but also aims to provide
    practical solutions for real-world applications in computer vision and natural
    language processing.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  To acquire knowledge,\
    \ we humans often answer lots of questions and then improve ourselves by comparing\
    \ our answers with the ground-truth answers. As a result, this learning mechanism\
    \ empowers humans with the answering ability, which allows humans to handle well\
    \ many real tasks, such as visual question answering [29, 59, 33, 30, 46, 45].\
    \ However, as described in the following slogan,  “The art of proposing a question\
    \ must be held in higher value than solving it.” - Georg Cantor [8]  asking a\
    \ question is very valuable and even more important than answering a question.\
    \ Indeed, humans also acquire knowledge from learning to ask questions since it\
    \ encourages individuals to engage more deeply with information, thereby enhancing\
    \ problem-solving skills [74, 75, 24, 62]. In addition to asking questions, humans\
    \ also improve themselves through self-evaluation: humans try to identify the\
    \ correctness of the answer and thus are involved in a deep understanding of our\
    \ diverse world [92, 72]. These three learning mechanisms not only play a vital\
    \ role in the human intelligence learning process but also empower humans with\
    \ the corresponding abilities, including answering, asking, and assessing abilities.\
    \ Among them, the answering ability is necessary to handle QA-like tasks; the\
    \ asking ability allows AI models to interact with humans or other AI models for\
    \ necessary information; and the evaluation ability assesses the solution candidates\
    \ given by humans or other models with many applications, e.g., the filtering\
    \ synthetic data.   Figure 1: Comparison of three abilities reveals that LLaVA1.5\
    \ excels in providing answers but struggles in asking accurate questions and assessing\
    \ question-answer pairs.   Although innate to humans, apart from answering ability,\
    \ two other learning mechanisms of asking and assessment remain formidable challenges\
    \ for contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Even though some\
    \ advanced MLLMs [45, 90, 4, 101] have even achieved remarkable proficiency in\
    \ handling multimodal questions pertaining to mathematics [5], science [45], and\
    \ commonsense knowledge [19]. However, the focus of most MLLMs [45, 19, 4, 90]\
    \ predominantly revolves around visual question answering (VQA) tasks. As a result,\
    \ as shown in Fig. 1, current MLLMs, e.g., the representative LLaVA-1.5 [45],\
    \ suffer from inferior performance on asking questions and self-assess question-answer\
    \ pairs (QA), which underscores their efficacy as problem-solvers and prohibits\
    \ profound multimodal understanding.   To address these challenges, we introduce\
    \ two essential tasks: GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at bolstering the intelligence\
    \ and robustness of MLLMs. GenQA focuses on enabling the model to generate diverse\
    \ question-answer (QA) pairs for images, thus equipping the MLLM with the capability\
    \ to ask questions. We believe that if an MLLM can successfully generate QA pairs\
    \ for challenging tasks, it indicates a higher level of problem-solving ability.\
    \ Specifically, we define the GenQA task to include not only generic VQA (e.g.,\
    \ VQAv2 [29] and GQA [33]) but also Multi-Choice VQA (MC VQA), and Multi-Turn\
    \ VQA (MT) to increase the variety of data formats. Additionally, we incorporate\
    \ two challenging multimodal grounding tasks into the training process: Referring\
    \ Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation (REG). Learning\
    \ to generate the data of these grounding tasks forces the MLLM to extract fine-grained\
    \ visual cues from images, such as explicit object localization and compositional\
    \ relationships. This, in turn, enhances the multimodal reasoning ability\n\n\
