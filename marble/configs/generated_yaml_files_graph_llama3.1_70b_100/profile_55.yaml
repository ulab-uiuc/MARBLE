    privacy and machine learning, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare
    and chemical data analysis. My recent work, including the development of the Privately
    Encoded Open Datasets with Public Labels (PEOPL) framework, focuses on enabling
    organizations to share encoded data for training machine learning models while

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Language models (LMs)\
    \ have emerged as powerful tools for solving natural language processing (NLP)\
    \ tasks. Given an input prompt, LMs generate a response from some predicted distribution\
    \ over output text sequences. For modern models, these generations are often coherent\
    \ and contextually relevant. At the same time, these generations can still contain\
    \ mistakes, and lack certain aspects of robustness and reliability in terms of\
    \ providing accurate, trustworthy predictions Jones and Steinhardt (2022); Krishna\
    \ et al. (2021); Lin et al. (2022a); Mallen et al. (2022); Srivastava et al. (2022);\
    \ Wang et al. (2023). Unfortunately, quantifying the uncertainty in LM outputs\
    \ has remained a major challenge.   Conformal prediction is a popular model-agnostic\
    \ and distribution-free method for creating prediction sets that contain the correct\
    \ answers with high probability Angelopoulos et al. (2023; 2021a; 2021b); Bates\
    \ et al. (2020); Lei et al. (2018); Romano et al. (2019); Vovk et al. (2005).\
    \ Applying conformal prediction to generative models such as LMs, however, is\
    \ challenging due to (a) the unbounded nature of their output space (i.e., all\
    \ possible text sequences), and (b) the limited available (tractable) mechanisms\
    \ for exploring all possible predictions. In particular, LMs can typically only\
    \ approximately search or sample candidate responses. Furthermore, while several\
    \ possible responses might be acceptable (e.g., correct or factual), small differences\
    \ can result in abrupt changes in coherence or meaning.   In this paper, we propose\
    \ an extension of conformal prediction that is tailored specifically to generative\
    \ LMs. We only assume that the (potentially black-box) LM that is given to us\
    \ can be used to sample diverse output sequences, together with their evaluated\
    \ model likelihoods (i.e., the output token sequence logits). Like conformal prediction,\
    \ our method offers a rigorous coverage guarantee by constructing prediction sets\
    \ that, in our case, provably contain at least one acceptable response with high\
    \ probability. Unlike conformal prediction, however, we do not enumerate the entire\
    \ output space (which is impossible). Instead, we derive a calibrated stopping\
    \ rule for sampling different outputs from the LM that get added to a growing\
    \ output set of candidates, until we are confident that the output set is sufficient.\
    \ Since not all samples from the LM may be high quality (e.g., some may be redundant,\
    \ incoherent, or have lower confidence), we also simultaneously calibrate a rejection\
    \ rule for removing candidates from the output set—while still ensuring that our\
    \ coverage bound is not violated. This gives the benefit of making our output\
    \ sets not only accurate, but also precise (i.e., small).   Figure 1: Our conformal\
    \ procedure samples candidate outputs from some blackbox LM until a stopping rule\
    \ is reached. Each sample is added to the output conformal set if it meets both\
    \ a minimum estimated quality and a diversity criterion. The procedure is calibrated\
    \ to stop when at least one candidate y\U0001D466yitalic_y from the conformal\
    \ set is admissible (A⁢(y)=1)\U0001D434\U0001D4661(A(y)=1)( italic_A ( italic_y\
    \ ) = 1 ) with high probability. In this example, samples y1subscript\U0001D466\
    1y_{1}italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and y2subscript\U0001D466\
    2y_{2}italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are in-admissible because\
    \ they hallucinate the presence of “edema” (in orange) and “hilar congestion”\
    \ (in magenta), respectively. The minimal output set includes y3subscript\U0001D466\
    3y_{3}italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, which is admissible. \
    \  To more concretely describe the exact type of guarantee that we\n\n       \
