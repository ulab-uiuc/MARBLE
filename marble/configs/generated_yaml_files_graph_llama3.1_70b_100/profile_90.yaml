  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT Robotic systems that rely primarily\
    \ on self-supervised learning have the potential to decrease the amount of human\
    \ annotation and engineering effort required to learn control strategies. In the\
    \ same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self- supervised techniques\
    \ from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds\
    \ on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast\
    \ as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified\
    \ rewards or labels. Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has\
    \ demonstrated how self-supervised RLmethods: (a)cold initialization as men- tioned\
    \ in Sec. 3.2. (b)learning rate warmup, fol- lowing the same warmup paradigm in\
    \ (Vaswani et al., 2017) – linearly increasing the learning rate to 3×10−4for\
    \ the first 100K gradient steps and then decreasing it proportionally to the in-\
    \ verse square root of remaining gradient steps. (c) using a 10×smaller learning\
    \ rate for the last lay- ers of ϕ(s, a)andψ(g). Our newexperiments, we now study\
    \ how increasing the representation dimen- sion affects the success rates. We\
    \ ablate the dimension of contrastive representation in the set{16,128,512}, averaging\
    \ success rates over 10 episodes of 3 random seeds. As shown in Fig. 29, representations\
    \ of sizes 128 and 512 achieve considerably lower success rates, echo- ing prior\
    \ work in finding that smaller represen- tations yield better performance in the\
    \ offline setting (Eysenbach et al., 2022). Theseresults might also be explained\
    \ by the increase of noise with a larger representation size, suggesting that\
    \ the smaller representations effectively act as a sort of regularization and\
    \ mitigate overfitting. 29Appendix Fig. 22). So, we are optimistic that these\
    \ design decisions may provide helpful guidance on further scaling theseappendix\
    \ contains additionalResults in Fig. 18 demonstrate that interpolation in the\
    \ V AE representation space and the pixel space are not well-aligned with the\
    \ ground truth time steps (better than random permutations), while contrastive\
    \ representations achieves a lower error, suggesting that it might contain information\
    \ that is uniquely well-suited for control and potentially leverage a goal-conditioned\
    \ policy. F.7 A RMMATCHING To evaluate the performance of contrastive RL in tackling\
    \ the arm matching problem, we collect a trajectory of contrastive RL trained\
    \ on the offline dataset and comparing the Q value predicted by stable contrastive\
    \ RL with a GC-IQL trained on top of V AE representations, assuming that pre-trained\
    \ features might help mitigate the arm matching problem as well. We normalize\
    \ both Qs by values of the minimum and the goal. As shown in Fig. 19, stable contrastive\
    \ RL correctly learns a monotonic increasing Q throughout the rollout, while GC-IQL\
    \ learns a V-shape Q relating higher values to a 23Published as a conference paper\
    \ at ICLR 2024 closer arm to the target position, ignoring the position of the\
    \ green block ( t= 30 ). This experiment demonstrates that representations derived\
    \ from V AE may be less efficient at predicting success than contrastive representations\
    \ in the scene involving temporal-extended reasoning. Stable contrastive RL GC-IQLGCBC\
