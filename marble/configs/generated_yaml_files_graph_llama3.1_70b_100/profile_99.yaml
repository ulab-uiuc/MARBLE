  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to the intersection of probability theory,
    optimization, and financial modeling. My work primarily focuses on developing
    robust frameworks for understanding complex systems, particularly through the
    lens of Markov chains and their convergence properties. I introduced a unified
    approach using Wasserstein distance to estimate convergence rates, which simplifies
    the analysis of drift conditions in various applications, including queueing models
    and stochastic optimization algorithms.


    In the realm of finance, I have explored innovative adaptations of classical models,
    notably enhancing the Black-Scholes option pricing formula by incorporating relativistic
    principles. This new formulation not only provides a more accurate representation
    of market behaviors, such as the volatility smile, but also introduces a novel
    family of stock price distributions that converge to lognormal, offering better
    empirical fit.


    Additionally, I have tackled challenges in the digital advertising sector, specifically
    in bid shading strategies for first-price auctions. By formulating a distributionally
    robust bid shading policy, I have demonstrated how to effectively navigate the
    uncertainties inherent in estimating both the value of ad opportunities and the
    competitive landscape. My research emphasizes the importance of principled approaches
    to uncertainty, leading to policies that outperform traditional methods in real-world
    applications. Through my work, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical
    solutions across diverse fields.'

    on developing innovative algorithms and frameworks for analyzing complex systems,
    particularly in the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and

    In my recent publications, I have explored the asymptotic statistical properties
    of data-driven DRO formulations, providing insights into their behavior as uncertainty
    radii decrease. I have also made significant contributions to understanding first
    passage times in branching random walks, offering precise asymptotic results that
    resolve longstanding conjectures.


    My research extends to perfect sampling algorithms for generalized Jackson networks
    and the development of unbiased Monte Carlo estimators for multivariate densities
    of max-stable fields. I have introduced methodologies that enable efficient simulation
    of steady-state distributions in non-Markovian loss networks, demonstrating their
    practical applicability in real-world scenarios.


    I am particularly passionate about bridging theoretical advancements with practical
    applications, as evidenced by my work on importance sampling algorithms for estimating

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  General state-space\
    \ Markov chains are indispensable in a wide array of fields due to their flexibility\
    \ and applicability in modeling random dynamical systems. To analyze the long-term\
    \ behavior of these Markovian models, estimating the rate of convergence to equilibrium\
    \ is critical. When designing reliable real-world systems (e.g. cloud platforms\
    \ and manufacturing lines), the faster the convergence, the faster the recovery\
    \ after disturbances. When designing efficient sample-based algorithms (e.g. stochastic\
    \ gradient descent (SGD) variants and MCMC), the faster the convergence, the faster\
    \ the goal attainment. The rate of convergence also appears in MDP-related sample\
    \ complexity results under the name \"mixing time\". Although convergence rate\
    \ estimation is critically important, estimating the convergence rate of even\
    \ a mildly complex chain can be extremely difficult.   Over the last three decades,\
    \ significant efforts have been made to bound the convergence of general state-space\
    \ Markov chains. Most of these works utilize a pair of drift and minorization\
    \ conditions (D&M) to bound the convergence in terms of the total variation (TV)\
    \ distance (Meyn et al., 1994; Rosenthal, 1995; Jarner and Roberts, 2002; Douc\
    \ et al., 2004; Baxendale, 2005; Andrieu et al., 2015). The drift condition forces\
    \ the chain to move towards a selected region. On such a region, the minorization\
    \ condition allows the chain to regenerate or to couple with a stationary version\
    \ of the chain. This analysis tends to produce overly conservative TV bounds,\
    \ especially in high-dimensional settings; see (Qin and Hobert, 2021) for a discussion.\
    \   The Wasserstein distance, as a measure of convergence to equilibrium, can\
    \ exhibit better dimension dependence (Qin and Hobert, 2022b). In addition, many\
    \ Markov chains of interest (e.g. constant step-size SGD minimizing convex loss\
    \ on finite datasets) converge in Wasserstein distance but not in TV distance.\
    \ Consequently, bounding convergence in Wasserstein distance has steadily gained\
    \ popularity over the years (Gibbs, 2004; Hairer et al., 2011; Butkovsky, 2014;\
    \ Durmus and Moulines, 2015; Durmus et al., 2016; Qin and Hobert, 2022a). Most\
    \ of these works replace the minorization condition with a contraction condition\
    \ (D&M becomes D&C). After returning to a selected region, two copies of the chain\
    \ tend to become closer to each other. Both D&M and D&C enforce two conditions\
    \ in two respective regions. However, partitioning the state space into two distinct\
    \ regions often leads to suboptimal rates.   Recently, (Qu et al., 2023) introduce\
    \ the so-called contractive drift condition (CD), a single condition enforced\
    \ on the entire state space, to explicitly bound the convergence in Wasserstein\
    \ distance. A special case of CD dates back to (Steinsaltz, 1999). By verifying\
    \ CD, (Qu et al., 2023) establish parametrically sharp convergence bounds for\
    \ stylized Markov chains arising from queueing theory and stochastic optimization\
    \ (e.g. revealing how step-size, heavy-tailed gradient noise, growth rate and\
    \ local curvature of objectives affect the convergence of stylized SGD). Although\
    \ CD may generate better bounds than D&M and D&C for stylized chains (e.g. SGD\
    \ with iid gradient noise), these methods are generally intended as theoretical\
    \ tools that can provide closed-form convergence bounds for structured models.\
    \ For more realistic, less structured chains, computational rather than analytical\
    \ methods are needed. However, despite of the rapid development of computational\
    \ power in the past decade, the convergence\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n \
