  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the understanding of 3D hand-object
    interactions, a critical area in vision computing. My work focuses on estimating
    the poses of both hands and objects, addressing the complexities of their interactions,
    such as contact and physical plausibility. I have developed a graph-based refinement
    method that utilizes an interaction-aware graph-attention mechanism, enhancing
    the representation of hand-object relationships and significantly improving physical
    plausibility in pose estimation.


    Recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, I created HOGraspNet, a comprehensive
    training dataset that captures full grasp taxonomies and provides extensive annotations.
    This dataset includes a diverse range of hand shapes from participants of various
    ages, continuous video frames, and a wealth of labeled data for 3D hand and object
    meshes, keypoints, and contact maps. By leveraging grasp taxonomies as atomic
    actions, HOGraspNet enables the representation of complex hand activities, paving
    the way for the development of universal shape priors and foundation models for
    3D hand-object interaction.


    My research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical
    applications, ultimately contributing to the development of more sophisticated
    vision systems capable of understanding and interacting with the physical world.
    I am excited to share my findings and resources with the community, as I believe
    they will inspire further exploration in this dynamic field.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am also passionate about exploring the structural dynamics of neural networks.
    My work on relational graphs has unveiled critical insights into how the architecture
    of neural networks influences their predictive performance, leading to the identification
    of optimal configurations that mirror biological neural networks.


    In addition to these advancements, I have introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs),
    which enhance the expressive power of message-passing frameworks by incorporating
    node identities. This innovation has resulted in substantial accuracy gains across
    multiple prediction tasks.


    My recent endeavors also include the ROLAND framework for dynamic graphs, which
    allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic environments, and
    the AutoTransfer method in automated machine learning (AutoML) that leverages
    prior architectural knowledge to improve search efficiency.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    driving forward the understanding and utility of GNNs in real-world scenarios.
    I am excited about the potential of my work to inspire future innovations in this
    rapidly evolving field.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nThe breakthroughs in\
    \ deep learning have led to a paradigm\nshift in arti\uFB01cial intelligence and\
    \ machine learning. On the\none hand, numerous old problems have been revisited\
    \ with\ndeep neural networks and huge progress has been made in\nmany tasks previously\
    \ seemed out of reach, such as machine\ntranslation and computer vision. On the\
    \ other hand, new\ntechniques such as geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al.\n\
    2017) are being developed to generalize deep neural models\nto new or non-traditional\
    \ domains.\nIt is well known that training a deep neural model typi-\ncally requires\
    \ a large amount of labeled data, which cannot\nbe satis\uFB01ed in many scenarios\
    \ due to the high cost of labeling\ntraining data. To reduce the amount of data\
    \ needed for train-\ning, a recent surge of research interest has focused on few-\n\
    shot learning (Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum 2015;\nRezende et al. 2016)\
    \ \u2013 to learn a classi\uFB01cation model with\nvery few examples from each\
    \ class. Closely related to few-\nshot learning is semi-supervised learning, where\
    \ a large\n\x03Corresponding author.\nCopyright c\r2018, Association for the Advancement\

    \ unlabeled data can be utilized to train with typi-\ncally a small amount of\
    \ labeled data.\nMany researches have shown that leveraging unlabeled\ndata in\
    \ training can improve learning accuracy signi\uFB01cantly\nif used properly (Zhu\
    \ and Goldberg 2009). The key issue is\nto maximize the effective utilization\
    \ of structural and fea-\nture information of unlabeled data. Due to the powerful\
    \ fea-\nture extraction capability and recent success of deep neu-\nral networks,\
    \ there have been some successful attempts to\nrevisit semi-supervised learning\
    \ with neural-network-based\nmodels, including ladder network (Rasmus et al. 2015),\n\
    semi-supervised embedding (Weston et al. 2008), planetoid\n(Yang, Cohen, and Salakhutdinov\
    \ 2016), and graph convo-\nlutional networks (Kipf and Welling 2017).\nThe recently\
    \ developed graph convolutional neural net-\nworks (GCNNs) (Defferrard, Bresson,\
    \ and Vandergheynst\n2016) is a successful attempt of generalizing the power-\n\
    ful convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in dealing with\nEuclidean data to modeling\
    \ graph-structured data. In their\npilot work (Kipf and Welling 2017), Kipf and\
    \ Welling pro-\nposed a simpli\uFB01ed type of GCNNs, called graph convolu-\n\
    tional networks (GCNs), and applied it to semi-supervised\nclassi\uFB01cation.\
    \ The GCN model naturally integrates the con-\nnectivity patterns and feature\
    \ attributes of graph-structured\ndata, and outperforms many state-of-the-art\
    \ results of other baselines are\ncopied from (Kipf and Welling 2017). Our Experiments\n\
    In this section, we conduct extensive Results Analysis\nThe classi\uFB01cation\
    \ Conclusions\nUnderstanding deep neural networks is crucial for realiz-\ning\
    \ their full potentials in real applications. This paper con-\ntributes to the\
    \ understanding of the GCN model and its appli-\ncation in semi-supervised classi\uFB01\
    cation. Our analysis not\nonly reveals the mechanisms and limitations of the GCN\n\
    model, but also leads to new solutions overcoming its limits.\nIn future work,\
    \ we plan to develop new convolutional \uFB01lters\nwhich are compatible with\
    \ deep architectures, and exploit\nadvanced deep learning techniques to improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance of GCNs for more graph-based applications. Acknowledgments\n\
