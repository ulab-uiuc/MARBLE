{"task": "Dear Research Team,\n\nYou are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nInteractive systems based on general-purpose LLMs have become widely popular due to their\nimpressive instruction-following capabilities (OpenAI, 2023). Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform them into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\n\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each task presents several limitations, such as a significantly higher memory footprint and the inability to leverage information across tasks, which could enhance both in-domain and out-of-domain performance. As a result, merging different homologous models (models fine-tuned from the same backbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness, knowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous models differ from each other in terms of delta parameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned model and backbone model parameters.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach for merging homologous models, termed Drop and rEscaLe via sampLing with mAgnitude (DELLA). This approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) involves delta parameter drops to reduce interference among model parameters. We propose MAGPRUNE, a novel pruning method that samples delta parameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) further reduces interference through sign-based delta parameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected delta parameters.\n\nOn three different homologous (expert) models considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and their corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaEval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms baseline Experiments.\n\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against the DARE baseline to show that magnitude sampling improves the selection of delta parameters to retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task performance. We vary the drop rate p in [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the DARE and DELLA to get models after removing the proportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate the model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT task. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE, random ranking, and MAGPRUNE.\n\n**Results**\n\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search for Model Merging\n\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hyperparameter search for each merging combination. While both MAGPRUNE and DARE can maintain the performance of individual expert model performance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our findings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5 works best for LM+Math, Math+Code, and LM+Math+Code. For LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus, we can infer that while dropping delta parameters helps reduce interference during merging, dropping too many parameters may lead to the loss of information useful for effective merging.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nA.1 Importance of GPT-4-as-a-judge for Math Tasks - Example\n\nQuestion: Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
