{"task": "This database is used in a File Sharing System to manage users, files, file sharing, and file access logs. It consists of four main tables: users, files, shared_files, and file_access_logs.\nRecently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Agents can also chat with each other to share information.  Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions. If the last round involves the Agents investigating via SQL queries, the next round should allow them to communicate to each other and discuss. In this round, each agent could talk to one other agent. Otherwise, assign the agents to investigate these reasons - agent1 on 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', agent 2 on 'MISSING_INDEXES', ..., agent5 on 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA'.\n", "coordination_mode": "graph", "iterations": []}
