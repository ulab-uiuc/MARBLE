            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  One paramount task in statistics and machine learning is to estimate the uncertainty of the underlying model from (possibly noisy) observations. For example, in interactive machine learning scenarios such as bandits (Thompson, 1933; Robbins, 1952; Lattimore and Szepesvári, 2020) and recently reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF; Ouyang et al. (2022); Christiano et al. (2017)), at each time step t𝑡titalic_t, the learner chooses an action 𝒙tsubscript𝒙𝑡{\bm{x}}_{t}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from an available set of actions 𝒳tsubscript𝒳𝑡\mathcal{X}_{t}caligraphic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and observes reward or outcome rtsubscript𝑟𝑡r_{t}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that is modeled as a distribution whose mean is an unknown function f∗superscript𝑓f^{*}italic_f start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT of 𝒙tsubscript𝒙𝑡{\bm{x}}_{t}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT; i.e., rt∼p(⋅|𝒙t;f∗)r_{t}\sim p(\cdot|{\bm{x}}_{t};f^{*})italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∼ italic_p ( ⋅ | bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; italic_f start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). One popular choice of such a model is generalized linear model (GLM; McCullagh and Nelder (1989)) that extends exponential family distributions to have linear structure in its natural parameter, i.e., ⟨𝒙,𝜽⋆⟩𝒙subscript𝜽⋆\langle{\bm{x}},\bm{\theta}_{\star}\rangle⟨ bold_italic_x , bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟩ where 𝜽⋆subscript𝜽⋆\bm{\theta}_{\star}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is an unknown parameter, which means that the mean function is f∗⁢(𝒙)=μ⁢(⟨𝒙,𝜽⋆⟩)superscript𝑓𝒙𝜇𝒙subscript𝜽⋆f^{*}({\bm{x}})=\mu(\langle{\bm{x}},\bm{\theta}_{\star}\rangle)italic_f start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_italic_x ) = italic_μ ( ⟨ bold_italic_x , bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟩ ) for some inverse link function μ𝜇\muitalic_μ. This encompasses a wide range of distributions, which in turn makes it ubiquitous in various real-world applications, such as news recommendations (Bernoulli; Li et al. (2010, 2012)), social network influence maximization (Poisson; Lage et al. (2013); Gisselbrecht et al. (2015)), and more. In such tasks, the learner must estimate the uncertainty about 𝜽⋆subscript𝜽⋆\bm{\theta}_{\star}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT at each time step t≥1𝑡1t\geq 1italic_t ≥ 1, given observations {(𝒙s,rs)}s=1t−1superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑠subscript𝑟𝑠𝑠1𝑡1\{({\bm{x}}_{s},r_{s})\}_{s=1}^{t-1}{ ( bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, to make wise decisions. One popular and useful way to capture the uncertainty is via a time-uniform confidence sequence (CS) {𝒞t⁢(δ)}t=1∞superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒞𝑡𝛿𝑡1\{\mathcal{C}_{t}(\delta)\}_{t=1}^{\infty}{ caligraphic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_δ ) } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∞ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, which takes the form of ℙ[∃t≥1:𝜽⋆∉𝒞t(δ)]≤δ{\mathbb{P}}[\exists t\geq 1:\bm{\theta}_{\star}\not\in{\mathcal{C}}_{t}(% \delta)]\leq\deltablackboard_P [ ∃ italic_t ≥ 1 : bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∉ caligraphic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_δ ) ] ≤ italic_δ. Recently, CS has been described as one of the key components for safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) that can ensure the validity/safeness of sequentially adaptive statistical inference (Ramdas et al., 2023).   There has been much work on deriving CS for specific families of distributions. Many common distributions are in a smaller family, called generalized linear models (GLMs). Existing CSs for GLM, however, are far from ideal. Much of the prior works focus on obtaining CS for specific instantiations of GLMs, such as Gaussian (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011; Flynn et al., 2023) and Bernoulli (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021; Faury et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2024). Especially for Bernoulli, all the existing CSs suffer from poly⁡(S)poly𝑆\operatorname{poly}(S)roman_poly ( italic_S ) factor in the radius, where S𝑆Sitalic_S is the norm of the unknown parameter 𝜽⋆subscript𝜽⋆\bm{\theta}_{\star}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Jun et al. (2017); Li et al. (2017); Emmenegger et al. (2023) proposed generic CSs that work for any convex GLMs, but their radii all suffer from a globally worst-case curvature of μ𝜇\muitalic_μ, which is detrimental in many cases

For example, in interactive machine learning scenarios such as bandits (Thompson, 1933; Robbins, 1952; Lattimore and Szepesvári, 2020) and recently reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF; Ouyang et al. (2022); Christiano et al.

One popular choice of such a model is generalized linear model (GLM; McCullagh and Nelder (1989)) that extends exponential family distributions to have linear structure in its natural parameter, i.e., ⟨𝒙,𝜽⋆⟩𝒙subscript𝜽⋆\\langle{\\bm{x}},\\bm{\\theta}_{\\star}\\rangle⟨ bold_italic_x , bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟩ where 𝜽⋆subscript𝜽⋆\\bm{\\theta}_{\\star}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is an unknown parameter, which means that the mean function is f∗⁢(𝒙)=μ⁢(⟨𝒙,𝜽⋆⟩)superscript𝑓𝒙𝜇𝒙subscript𝜽⋆f^{*}({\\bm{x}})=\\mu(\\langle{\\bm{x}},\\bm{\\theta}_{\\star}\\rangle)italic_f start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( bold_italic_x ) = italic_μ ( ⟨ bold_italic_x , bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟩ ) for some inverse link function μ𝜇\\muitalic_μ. This encompasses a wide range of distributions, which in turn makes it ubiquitous in various real-world applications, such as news recommendations (Bernoulli; Li et al. (2010, 2012)), social network influence maximization (Poisson; Lage et al. (2013); Gisselbrecht et al. (2015)), and more.

Recently, CS has been described as one of the key components for safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) that can ensure the validity/safeness of sequentially adaptive statistical inference (Ramdas et al., 2023).   There has been much work on deriving CS for specific families of distributions. Many common distributions are in a smaller family, called generalized linear models (GLMs). Existing CSs for GLM, however, are far from ideal. Much of the prior works focus on obtaining CS for specific instantiations of GLMs, such as Gaussian (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011; Flynn et al., 2023) and Bernoulli (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021; Faury et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2024). Especially for Bernoulli, all the existing CSs suffer from poly⁡(S)poly𝑆\\operatorname{poly}(S)roman_poly ( italic_S ) factor in the radius, where S𝑆Sitalic_S is the norm of the unknown parameter 𝜽⋆subscript𝜽⋆\\bm{\\theta}_{\\star}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

 | Iteration 3:  | Iteration 4:  | Iteration 5: ","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**

What are the limitations of existing Confidence Sequences (CS) for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), particularly in the case of Bernoulli distributions?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Addressing the limitations of CS for GLMs, especially for Bernoulli distributions, is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of uncertainty estimation in various real-world applications. Solving this problem can advance statistical inference methods and enhance decision-making processes in interactive machine learning scenarios.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenge lies in developing CSs that provide accurate uncertainty estimates for GLMs, specifically Bernoulli distributions, without suffering from a poly(S) factor in the radius. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of the underlying models and the need to account for the unknown parameter's norm.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on specific instantiations of GLMs, leading to CSs that are not ideal for all scenarios. Existing solutions for Bernoulli distributions have limitations in terms of radius factors, hindering their effectiveness. The lack of a comprehensive and efficient CS for GLMs, especially for Bernoulli distributions, has prevented this problem from being fully addressed.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

The proposed methodology involves developing a new Confidence Sequence (CS) that overcomes the limitations of existing CSs for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), particularly for Bernoulli distributions. The approach will involve refining the radius factor and improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimation. The expected outcome is a more robust and efficient CS that can provide reliable uncertainty estimates for GLMs, enhancing decision-making processes in various applications.",-1,-1,-1

How can we develop a more effective time-uniform confidence sequence for generalized linear models (GLMs) that minimizes the radius of uncertainty estimates while maintaining valid coverage?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Addressing this problem is crucial for enhancing the reliability of sequential decision-making algorithms in machine learning, particularly in high-stakes applications like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. Improved confidence sequences can lead to better decision-making under uncertainty, fostering trust in machine learning models. This research could pave the way for future studies on adaptive statistical inference and uncertainty quantification, ultimately leading to more robust and interpretable models in various domains.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between the tightness of the confidence intervals and the validity of the coverage. Naive approaches may fail to account for the complexities of the underlying distributions and the specific characteristics of GLMs, leading to overly conservative or invalid confidence estimates. Additionally, the need to generalize across different types of GLMs while ensuring computational efficiency adds to the complexity of the problem.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on specific instances of GLMs, often resulting in confidence sequences that are not optimal across the broader class of models. Limitations include reliance on problem-dependent concentration results and the inability to adaptively adjust to varying levels of uncertainty. Our approach aims to unify these methods by developing a model-agnostic framework that can dynamically adjust the confidence sequences based on observed data, thus overcoming the rigidity of existing solutions.

From agent1 to agent2: I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning, decision-making, and fairness in data analysis. My recent work has focused on multi-agent multi-armed bandit problems, where I explore collaborative strategies to minimize group regret while addressing arm heterogeneity and communication costs. I have developed innovative protocols, such as Flooding with Absorption (FwA), which significantly reduce communication overhead in complex networks.

I also believe that the generic CSs proposed by Jun et al. and Li et al. are worth further investigation, as they have the potential to work for any convex GLMs. However, I agree that their radii suffer from a globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function, which is detrimental in many cases.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**

Develop a new time-uniform confidence sequence (CS) for generalized linear models (GLMs) that does not suffer from the poly(S) factor in the radius.

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem will advance knowledge in the area of machine learning and provide a more accurate and efficient way to estimate uncertainty in GLMs. This will have broader implications for various real-world applications, such as news recommendations, social network influence maximization, and more. A new CS for GLMs that does not suffer from the poly(S) factor in the radius will enable more accurate and efficient decision-making in these applications.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The poly(S) factor in the radius of existing CSs for GLMs is a significant challenge that needs to be overcome. Developing a new CS that does not suffer from this limitation requires a novel approach to bounding the uncertainty of the unknown parameter. The existing generic CSs proposed by Jun et al. and Li et al. suffer from a globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function, which is detrimental in many cases.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on obtaining CSs for specific instantiations of GLMs, such as Gaussian and Bernoulli, but not for the general case. The poly(S) factor in the radius of existing CSs for GLMs has been a significant barrier to solving this problem. The existing generic CSs proposed by Jun et al. and Li et al. have limitations that prevent them from being applied to all GLMs.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

The proposed approach involves developing a new CS for GLMs that does not suffer from the poly(S) factor in the radius. This will be achieved by using a different approach to bounding the uncertainty of the unknown parameter, such as using a more sophisticated concentration inequality. The expected outcomes include a new CS for GLMs that is more accurate and efficient than existing methods, and a better understanding of the limitations of existing CSs for GLMs. The proposed methodology will involve a literature review of existing CSs for GLMs, a detailed analysis of the poly(S) factor in the radius, and the development of a new CS that overcomes this limitation.",-1,-1,-1

How can we develop a unified and efficient confidence sequence for generalized linear models that is applicable to various sequential decision-making problems, including bandits, and overcomes the limitations of existing approaches?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of sequential decision-making, as it will enable the development of more efficient and effective algorithms for various applications, such as bandits, reinforcement learning, and online learning. A unified confidence sequence will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model, leading to better decision-making and improved performance. This research will also have broader implications for the research community, as it will provide a new framework for analyzing and solving sequential decision-making problems.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Developing a unified confidence sequence for generalized linear models is challenging due to the complexity of the problem. Existing approaches are often limited to specific instantiations of generalized linear models, such as Gaussian or Bernoulli, and may not be applicable to other models. Additionally, the problem requires overcoming technical obstacles, such as deriving a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, and developing a new proof technique that avoids the self-concordant control lemma. Furthermore, the problem requires addressing practical challenges, such as handling non-stationary environments and abrupt changes.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing confidence sequences for specific generalized linear models, but a unified approach has not been developed. Existing solutions often rely on problem-dependent concentration results and are limited to specific combinations of parameterization, noise family, and estimator. Additionally, previous approaches may not be applicable to non-stationary environments or abrupt changes. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a unified likelihood ratio-based confidence sequence that is applicable to any generalized linear model and overcomes the limitations of existing approaches.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our approach involves developing a unified likelihood ratio-based confidence sequence for generalized linear models. We will derive a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior and develop a new proof technique that avoids the self-concordant control lemma. We will also propose a simple and natural optimistic algorithm called OFUGLB, applicable to any generalized linear bandits. Our analysis will show that the celebrated optimistic approach simultaneously attains state-of-the-art regrets for various self-concordant generalized linear bandits. We expect our approach to outperform or be at par with prior algorithms for logistic bandits and to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model.",-1,-1,-1

               1 Introduction  One paramount task in statistics and machine learning is to estimate the uncertainty of the underlying model from (possibly noisy) observations. For example, in interactive machine learning scenarios such as bandits (Thompson, 1933; Robbins, 1952; Lattimore and Szepesvári, 2020) and recently reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF; Ouyang et al. (2022); Christiano et al.

This encompasses a wide range of distributions, which in turn makes it ubiquitous in various real-world applications, such as news recommendations (Bernoulli; Li et al.

From agent2 to agent1: Let's collaborate to generate a new research idea based on the given introduction about estimating the uncertainty of the underlying model from observations.
From agent1 to agent2: To generate a new research idea, let's first summarize the introduction. The introduction discusses the importance of estimating uncertainty in machine learning models, particularly in interactive scenarios such as bandits and reinforcement learning with human feedback. It highlights the use of generalized linear models (GLMs) and the need for time-uniform confidence sequences (CS) to capture uncertainty. However, existing CSs for GLMs have limitations, such as the poly(S) factor in the radius and the globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function. Shall we proceed with brainstorming potential research ideas that build upon or address these gaps?
From agent2 to agent1: Yes, let's proceed with brainstorming potential research ideas that build upon or address the gaps in existing CSs for GLMs. One possible direction could be to explore new methods for constructing CSs that avoid the poly(S) factor in the radius or reduce the impact of the globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function. Another direction could be to investigate the application of CSs to more complex models, such as neural networks or deep learning architectures.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can we develop a time-uniform confidence sequence for generalized linear models that reduces the poly(S) factor in the radius and improves the curvature of the inverse link function?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem is interesting and important because it can lead to more accurate and reliable estimates of uncertainty in machine learning models, which is crucial for making informed decisions in a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. A solution to this problem can also advance knowledge in the field of machine learning and statistics, leading to new research directions and practical applications. By addressing this question, we can improve the performance of machine learning models in real-world scenarios, enabling better decision-making and outcomes.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
Developing a time-uniform confidence sequence that addresses the limitations of existing methods is challenging due to the complexity of the underlying models and the need to balance the trade-off between the radius and the curvature of the inverse link function. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they do not account for the specific characteristics of generalized linear models, such as the poly(S) factor in the radius and the globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function. Additionally, the problem requires a deep understanding of statistical theory, machine learning, and optimization techniques, making it a technically demanding task.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on developing confidence sequences for specific families of distributions, such as Gaussian or Bernoulli, but these methods have limitations, such as the poly(S) factor in the radius or the globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function. Recent work has proposed generic confidence sequences that work for any convex generalized linear models, but these radii suffer from a globally worst-case curvature of the inverse link function. The problem remains unsolved because existing methods do not address the specific challenges of generalized linear models, and new approaches are needed to overcome these limitations. Our approach differs from prior work by focusing on developing a time-uniform confidence sequence that specifically addresses the limitations of existing methods for generalized linear models.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves developing a new confidence sequence that utilizes a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, which is a novel approach that has not been explored before. We will use a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The key components of our approach include: (1) developing a new confidence sequence that addresses the limitations of existing methods, (2) using a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, and (3) evaluating the performance of our proposed method using numerical simulations. We expect our results to show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability, and provides a more robust and efficient way to estimate uncertainty in machine learning models.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Formal verification (FV), or automated program verification [35, 2] checks if a code meets a specific demand and is correct to implement. As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies. For example, over 50% of lemmas have a depth greater than 78,

As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result.

To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information.

As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies.

How can we effectively leverage large language models (LLMs) in the automated theorem proving process to enhance formal verification of diverse programming languages?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial as it addresses the limitations of current formal verification methods, which primarily rely on symbolic verifiers and handcrafted rules. By integrating LLMs with automated theorem proving, we can create a more flexible and scalable verification environment. This advancement could lead to significant improvements in software reliability and security, impacting various fields such as embedded systems, smart contracts, and safety-critical applications. Furthermore, it could pave the way for future research in automated reasoning and machine learning applications in formal methods.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The complexity arises from the need to bridge the gap between the expressive power of LLMs and the rigorous requirements of formal verification. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent challenges in translating code into formal specifications and generating valid proofs. Additionally, the interaction between LLMs and theorem provers must be carefully managed to ensure soundness and completeness. Technical obstacles include the need for extensive training data that captures deep dependencies and the development of effective feedback mechanisms to guide the LLMs during the proof generation process.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has largely focused on either symbolic verification or handcrafted rules, which do not fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. The lack of comprehensive datasets that encompass a wide range of programming languages and verification scenarios has also hindered progress. Additionally, existing solutions often do not integrate LLMs with automated theorem proving in a systematic way. Our approach differs by proposing a structured environment (FVEL) that utilizes a large-scale dataset (FVELer) specifically designed for this purpose, enabling a more effective interaction between LLMs and formal verification processes.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our methodology involves the development of the FVEL environment, which transforms code into Isabelle formulations for verification. We will utilize the FVELer dataset, comprising 758 theories, 29,125 lemmas, and 200,646 proof steps, to fine-tune LLMs and evaluate their performance on benchmarks like Code2Inv and SV-COMP. The expected outcomes include improved problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in formal verification tasks, a reduction in proof errors, and a demonstration of the effectiveness of LLMs in generating valid proofs within an automated theorem proving framework.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Formal verification (FV), or automated program verification [35, 2] checks if a code meets a specific demand and is correct to implement. As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies. For example, over 50% of lemmas have a depth greater than 78,

As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies. For example, over 50% of lemmas have a depth greater than 78,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

How can we leverage large language models (LLMs) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of formal verification in software development, particularly in the context of automated theorem proving (ATP)?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has the potential to revolutionize the field of formal verification, enabling the development of more reliable and secure software systems. By leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of formal verification, making it more accessible and practical for a wider range of applications. This, in turn, can lead to significant advances in fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software engineering. Moreover, the ability to automate formal verification can reduce the time and cost associated with software development, making it more competitive in the global market.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

This problem is hard because it requires the integration of two complex technologies: formal verification and large language models. Formal verification is a well-established field, but it is often limited by its reliance on manual proof construction and verification. On the other hand, LLMs are powerful tools for natural language processing, but they are not yet well-suited for formal verification tasks. Moreover, the interaction between formal verification and LLMs is a complex problem that requires the development of new algorithms, techniques, and tools. Additionally, the lack of a large-scale dataset for formal verification and LLMs interaction is a significant barrier to progress in this area.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

This problem has not been solved before because it requires the integration of two complex technologies, formal verification and LLMs, which has been a significant challenge. Additionally, the lack of a large-scale dataset for formal verification and LLMs interaction has limited the development of new algorithms and techniques for this problem. Furthermore, the complexity of the problem has made it difficult to develop a comprehensive solution that can handle the nuances of formal verification and LLMs interaction.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed approach involves the development of a new formal verification environment, FVEL, that interacts with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. The key components of our approach are:

* A large-scale dataset, FVELer, that contains C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states.
* A new algorithm for integrating formal verification and LLMs, which involves the use of ATP to generate proof states and the FVEL environment to provide feedback via prover information in the PISA environment.
* A comprehensive evaluation of our approach using the FVELer dataset, which will involve the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the performance of our approach.

We expect our approach to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of formal verification in software development, particularly in the context of automated theorem proving. We also expect our approach to provide a new framework for integrating formal verification and LLMs, which can be used to develop more reliable and secure software systems.",-1,-1,-1

As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies.

As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies. For example, over 50% of lemmas have a depth greater than 78,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

How can we develop an effective formal verification environment that leverages large language models (LLMs) and automated theorem proving (ATP) to verify diverse and abundant synthesis programs?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has the potential to advance the field of formal verification and automated theorem proving. The ability to verify synthesis programs is crucial in ensuring the correctness and reliability of software systems. By leveraging LLMs and ATP, we can develop a more efficient and effective formal verification environment that can handle complex and diverse synthesis programs. This can lead to practical applications in various fields, such as software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.

Moreover, this research can contribute to the development of more advanced and sophisticated formal verification techniques, which can have a significant impact on the research community. It can also lead to new research directions and collaborations between researchers from different fields, such as computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Solving this problem is challenging because it requires the integration of two complex fields: formal verification and automated theorem proving. Formal verification involves the use of mathematical techniques to prove the correctness of software systems, while automated theorem proving involves the use of algorithms to prove mathematical theorems. Combining these two fields requires a deep understanding of both areas and the development of new techniques and tools.

Moreover, the problem is hard because it requires the development of a formal verification environment that can handle diverse and abundant synthesis programs. This means that the environment must be able to handle different programming languages, different types of synthesis programs, and different levels of complexity.

Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they may not be able to handle the complexity and diversity of synthesis programs. For example, a simple formal verification environment may not be able to handle programs with complex loops or recursive functions. Similarly, a simple automated theorem prover may not be able to handle theorems with complex mathematical structures.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Despite the importance of formal verification and automated theorem proving, the problem of developing an effective formal verification environment that leverages LLMs and ATP has not been solved before. This is because previous research has focused on developing formal verification environments that are specific to particular programming languages or types of synthesis programs.

Moreover, previous research has not fully explored the potential of LLMs and ATP in formal verification. While LLMs have been used in various applications, such as natural language processing and machine learning, their potential in formal verification has not been fully explored. Similarly, ATP has been used in various applications, such as mathematics and computer science, but its potential in formal verification has not been fully explored.

Our approach differs from previous work because it combines the strengths of LLMs and ATP to develop a more effective and efficient formal verification environment. We propose to use LLMs to generate formal specifications and ATP to prove the correctness of synthesis programs. This approach has the potential to handle diverse and abundant synthesis programs and to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous formal verification environment.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our approach consists of the following key components:

1. **Formal specification generation**: We propose to use LLMs to generate formal specifications for synthesis programs. This involves training LLMs on a dataset of formal specifications and using them to generate new specifications for given synthesis programs.
2. **Automated theorem proving**: We propose to use ATP to prove the correctness of synthesis programs. This involves using ATP to prove theorems that correspond to the formal specifications generated by the LLMs.
3. **Formal verification environment**: We propose to develop a formal verification environment that integrates the LLMs and ATP. This environment will take as input a synthesis program and generate a formal specification using the LLMs. It will then use the ATP to prove the correctness of the program.

Our expected outcomes include:

1. **Improved formal verification**: We expect our approach to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous formal verification environment that can handle diverse and abundant synthesis programs.
2. **Increased efficiency**: We expect our approach to be more efficient than traditional formal verification methods, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.
3. **New research directions**: We expect our approach to lead to new research directions and collaborations between researchers from different fields, such as computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.",-1,-1,-1

As the code synthesis ability of current models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14] is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result, the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation, and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment, we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies, which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark. The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find. Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies.

            Dear Research Team,

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Tensor decomposition methods have recently found numerous applications in machine learning. Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\times× speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.   Our core contribution is the following theorem, which shows that we can efficiently compute a

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\\times× speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Tensor decomposition methods have recently found numerous applications in machine learning. Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\times× speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.   Our core contribution is the following theorem, which shows that we can efficiently compute a

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X.

How can we develop a more efficient randomized alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm for tensor train (TT) decomposition that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of tensor decomposition, which has wide applications in machine learning, data science, and signal processing. A more efficient algorithm could enable researchers to handle larger datasets and more complex models, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as neuroimaging, feature extraction, and real-time data analysis. This research could pave the way for future studies that leverage tensor decompositions in novel applications, enhancing the overall understanding and capabilities of machine learning techniques.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenges in developing an efficient randomized ALS algorithm stem from the inherent complexity of tensor decompositions, particularly as the dimensionality of the tensors increases. Traditional methods, such as TT-SVD and ALS, have exponential computational costs that make them impractical for large-scale tensors. Naive approaches may fail due to the need for precise handling of tensor structures and the risk of significant approximation errors. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative techniques that balance computational efficiency with accuracy, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on deterministic algorithms or basic randomized techniques that do not adequately address the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional tensors. Many existing methods lack the robustness needed for large-scale applications, and there has been limited exploration of advanced sampling techniques, such as leverage score sampling, in the context of ALS for TT decomposition. Our approach aims to fill this gap by integrating these advanced sampling methods into a new framework that enhances both speed and accuracy.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a randomized ALS algorithm for TT decomposition, termed rTT-ALS, which utilizes exact leverage score sampling to reduce the size of least squares problems in each iteration. We will conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing the performance of rTT-ALS against traditional TT-SVD and ALS methods. Key metrics for evaluation will include computational time, accuracy of the decomposition, and scalability to large tensors. We expect rTT-ALS to demonstrate significant speed improvements (up to 26×) with minimal loss in accuracy, thereby establishing a new standard for efficient tensor decomposition.",-1,-1,-1

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling.

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018].

Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation.

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\\times× speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.

How can we develop an efficient and scalable tensor decomposition method that can handle high-dimensional tensors and provide accurate results, while also addressing the limitations of existing methods such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because tensor decomposition is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data science, with numerous applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and signal processing. Developing an efficient and scalable tensor decomposition method can lead to breakthroughs in these fields, enabling the analysis of large-scale datasets and the discovery of new patterns and relationships. Furthermore, such a method can also advance our understanding of complex systems and phenomena, leading to practical applications in areas such as healthcare, finance, and climate modeling.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

This problem is hard because tensor decomposition is a challenging task, especially when dealing with high-dimensional tensors. The number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of the tensor, making it difficult to compute and store. Additionally, finding a rank-R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem, and existing methods such as the TT-SVD algorithm and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) have high computational costs. Furthermore, the curse of dimensionality and the presence of noise and missing values in real-world datasets can also make tensor decomposition a difficult task.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Despite the importance of tensor decomposition, existing methods have limitations that have prevented the development of an efficient and scalable method. For example, the TT-SVD algorithm requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of the tensor, which can be computationally expensive. ALS is also a popular method, but it can be slow and may not converge to the optimal solution. Randomized variants of these methods have been proposed, but they may not provide strong accuracy guarantees. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm that relies on exact leverage score sampling, which can provide strong guarantees on the approximation error while reducing the computational cost.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm that relies on exact leverage score sampling. We will use a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we will:

* Develop a new algorithm for computing the exact leverage scores of the design matrices in the ALS subproblems
* Propose a randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm that uses the exact leverage scores to select a subset of columns to update in each iteration
* Evaluate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, including high-dimensional tensors with noise and missing values
* Compare our method to existing methods such as TT-SVD and ALS, and demonstrate its advantages in terms of computational cost and accuracy.

We expect our method to achieve significant speedups over existing methods while maintaining high accuracy, making it a valuable tool for tensor decomposition in machine learning and data science applications.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Tensor decomposition methods have recently found numerous applications in machine learning. Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\times× speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing [Zhou et al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning [Novikov et al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction [Bengua et al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes [Izmailov et al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions [Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R𝑅Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem [Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition [Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N𝑁Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm [Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square (ALS) is another popular approach [Holtz et al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N𝑁Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of 𝒳𝒳\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition (SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart [Halko et al., 2011, Huber et al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26×\\times× speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can we efficiently compute the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition of high-dimensional tensors while maintaining accuracy?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem can lead to significant advancements in machine learning and data science, enabling efficient processing of high-dimensional data in various applications, such as neuro-imaging, signal processing, and supervised learning. This can have a profound impact on future research, leading to breakthroughs in areas like feature extraction, scaling up Gaussian processes, and improving the accuracy of machine learning models. The development of efficient TT decomposition algorithms can also facilitate the analysis of large-scale datasets, leading to new insights and discoveries in fields like science, engineering, and healthcare.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
Computing the TT decomposition is challenging due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, which leads to exponential growth in computational costs. Naive approaches, such as exact singular value decomposition (SVD), are computationally expensive, and existing randomized variants of TT-ALS have limitations. The proposed approach must overcome technical obstacles, including the development of efficient algorithms for computing leverage scores, the design of effective sampling strategies, and the optimization of hyperparameters to balance accuracy and computational cost.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on developing exact or approximate algorithms for TT decomposition, but these methods often suffer from high computational costs or limited scalability. The use of randomized algorithms and sampling techniques has shown promise, but existing approaches have limitations, such as requiring careful tuning of hyperparameters or relying on heuristics. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging exact leverage score sampling to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy, and by developing a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm that can efficiently compute the TT decomposition of high-dimensional tensors.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves the development of a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm, which leverages exact leverage score sampling to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The key components of our approach include: (1) the development of an efficient algorithm for computing leverage scores, (2) the design of an effective sampling strategy to reduce the computational cost of TT decomposition, and (3) the optimization of hyperparameters to balance accuracy and computational cost. We plan to evaluate our approach using a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, and to compare our results with existing state-of-the-art methods for TT decomposition. We expect our approach to achieve significant reductions in computational cost while maintaining accuracy, and to facilitate the analysis of large-scale datasets in a range of applications.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Figure 1: Encoding and predicting content (images, videos, and text) and behavior in the language space. Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs), once trained, can enable a host of different applications, including behavior simulation, content understanding, content-behavior optimization, and content-behavior understanding.              (a)      (b)       (c)      (d)     Figure 2:   Comparison of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Vicuna-13B, and LCBM-13B on: (a) Behavior Simulation accuracy on two types of behaviors: replay value prediction and likes/views prediction. The task is, given the video content and channel information, to predict replay values corresponding to each scene and the ratio of likes to views. (b) Content simulation and behavior understanding tasks. The task for content simulation is, given the channel information and scene-level behavior, to predict the scene content. Given information on the video platform and the video content, the task of behavior understanding is to predict and explain the sentiments of the viewers and the commenters. Six evaluators scored the models’ explanations between 0-5 to get the predicted sentiment and explanation scores by comparing the ratings and reasons with the user comments. The annotators did not know which model gave the reasoning. (c) Content understanding tasks. We evaluate four tasks: emotion, topic, and persuasion strategy prediction, and action-and-reason understanding. (d) Behavior Simulation on in-house Email Marketing Data (R2superscript𝑅2R^{2}italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT score) and Twitter likes (accuracy), and Content Simulation on Twitter tweet prediction (BLEU/ROUGE scores). It can be noted that on the behavior simulation, content simulation, and behavior understanding tasks, LCBM performs better than 3-shot GPT-3.5 and 10-shot GPT-4 (covering a larger area. On the content understanding tasks, while LCBM outperforms similar-sized Vicuna models, GPT-3.5 performs better. However, we also note that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are at least 12 times larger than LCBM-13B. Further, we show the behavior domain adaptation results in Table 4,  10,  10.    Shannon & Weaver (1949), in their seminal paper on communication, includes all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This includes all forms of expression, such as words, gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. They mentioned that the broad problem of communication can be studied at three levels: technical, semantic, and effectiveness.   Level A: Technical. How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?   Level B: Semantic. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?   Level C: Effectiveness. How well does the received meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build on top of each other. Thus, solving the problem at Level C necessarily requires solving the corresponding problems at Levels A and B.   Since the publication of this seminal paper, the tremendous growth in the field of telecommunications, particularly the advent of the Internet and mobile devices, has led to affordable, wide-scale solutions for Level A. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-3 and 4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and many more, we have witnessed a significant improvement in the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. LLMs in zero- or few-shot settings can easily handle tasks such as question answering, summarization, translation, and many more. This has helped us progress towards solving Level B

The task is, given the video content and channel information, to predict replay values corresponding to each scene and the ratio of likes to views. (b) Content simulation and behavior understanding tasks. The task for content simulation is, given the channel information and scene-level behavior, to predict the scene content. Given information on the video platform and the video content, the task of behavior understanding is to predict and explain the sentiments of the viewers and the commenters. Six evaluators scored the models’ explanations between 0-5 to get the predicted sentiment and explanation scores by comparing the ratings and reasons with the user comments. The annotators did not know which model gave the reasoning. (c) Content understanding tasks.

On the content understanding tasks, while LCBM outperforms similar-sized Vicuna models, GPT-3.5 performs better.

How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?   Level B: Semantic. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?   Level C: Effectiveness. How well does the received meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build on top of each other.

(b) Content simulation and behavior understanding tasks. The task for content simulation is, given the channel information and scene-level behavior, to predict the scene content. Given information on the video platform and the video content, the task of behavior understanding is to predict and explain the sentiments of the viewers and the commenters.

How well does the received meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build on top of each other.

How can Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs) be optimized to better predict and influence user behavior in digital communication contexts?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of digital communication strategies, particularly in marketing, social media, and content creation. By improving LCBMs, researchers can develop models that not only understand content but also predict user reactions, leading to more personalized and impactful communication. This advancement could significantly influence future research in behavioral science, marketing strategies, and the design of AI systems that interact with users, ultimately fostering better user engagement and satisfaction.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The complexity arises from the need to integrate various dimensions of user behavior, such as emotional responses, contextual factors, and the dynamic nature of digital interactions. Naive approaches may fail because they often overlook the multifaceted influences on user behavior, such as cultural differences and individual preferences. Additionally, technical challenges include the need for large, diverse datasets that accurately reflect user interactions and the development of algorithms capable of processing and learning from this data effectively.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on either content understanding or user behavior prediction in isolation, neglecting the interplay between the two. Existing models often lack the capability to adapt to real-time user feedback and contextual changes. Barriers include insufficient data on user behavior in various contexts and the complexity of modeling human emotions and intentions. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by incorporating behavior tokens into the training of LCBMs, allowing for a more holistic understanding of user interactions.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our methodology involves training LCBMs on a newly developed Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) that includes user behavior data such as likes, shares, and comments alongside content. We will employ machine learning techniques to analyze this data and optimize the models for behavior prediction. Metrics for evaluation will include accuracy in predicting user engagement and sentiment analysis scores. We expect our approach to yield models that not only perform well on traditional content understanding tasks but also excel in predicting and influencing user behavior, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of digital communication strategies.",-1,-1,-1

However, we also note that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are at least 12 times larger than LCBM-13B. Further, we show the behavior domain adaptation results in Table 4,  10,  10.    Shannon & Weaver (1949), in their seminal paper on communication, includes all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This includes all forms of expression, such as words, gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. They mentioned that the broad problem of communication can be studied at three levels: technical, semantic, and effectiveness.   Level A: Technical. How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?   Level B: Semantic. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?   Level C: Effectiveness. How well does the received meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build on top of each other. Thus, solving the problem at Level C necessarily requires solving the corresponding problems at Levels A and B.   Since the publication of this seminal paper, the tremendous growth in the field of telecommunications, particularly the advent of the Internet and mobile devices, has led to affordable, wide-scale solutions for Level A. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-3 and 4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and many more, we have witnessed a significant improvement in the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Figure 1: Encoding and predicting content (images, videos, and text) and behavior in the language space. Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs), once trained, can enable a host of different applications, including behavior simulation, content understanding, content-behavior optimization, and content-behavior understanding.              (a)      (b)       (c)      (d)     Figure 2:   Comparison of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Vicuna-13B, and LCBM-13B on: (a) Behavior Simulation accuracy on two types of behaviors: replay value prediction and likes/views prediction. The task is, given the video content and channel information, to predict replay values corresponding to each scene and the ratio of likes to views. (b) Content simulation and behavior understanding tasks. The task for content simulation is, given the channel information and scene-level behavior, to predict the scene content. Given information on the video platform and the video content, the task of behavior understanding is to predict and explain the sentiments of the viewers and the commenters. Six evaluators scored the models’ explanations between 0-5 to get the predicted sentiment and explanation scores by comparing the ratings and reasons with the user comments. The annotators did not know which model gave the reasoning. (c) Content understanding tasks. We evaluate four tasks: emotion, topic, and persuasion strategy prediction, and action-and-reason understanding. (d) Behavior Simulation on in-house Email Marketing Data (R2superscript𝑅2R^{2}italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT score) and Twitter likes (accuracy), and Content Simulation on Twitter tweet prediction (BLEU/ROUGE scores). It can be noted that on the behavior simulation, content simulation, and behavior understanding tasks, LCBM performs better than 3-shot GPT-3.5 and 10-shot GPT-4 (covering a larger area. On the content understanding tasks, while LCBM outperforms similar-sized Vicuna models, GPT-3.5 performs better. However, we also note that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are at least 12 times larger than LCBM-13B. Further, we show the behavior domain adaptation results in Table 4,  10,  10.    Shannon & Weaver (1949), in their seminal paper on communication, includes all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This includes all forms of expression, such as words, gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. They mentioned that the broad problem of communication can be studied at three levels: technical, semantic, and effectiveness.   Level A: Technical. How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?   Level B: Semantic. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?   Level C: Effectiveness. How well does the received meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build on top of each other. Thus, solving the problem at Level C necessarily requires solving the corresponding problems at Levels A and B.   Since the publication of this seminal paper, the tremendous growth in the field of telecommunications, particularly the advent of the Internet and mobile devices, has led to affordable, wide-scale solutions for Level A. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-3 and 4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and many more, we have witnessed a significant improvement in the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. LLMs in zero- or few-shot settings can easily handle tasks such as question answering, summarization, translation, and many more. This has helped us progress towards solving Level B

How can we develop a Large Content Behavior Model (LCBM) that effectively simulates and understands human behavior in various contexts, such as social media, online platforms, and real-world scenarios, while addressing the challenges of content heterogeneity, temporal inconsistency, and user-level sparsity?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing our understanding of human behavior and developing more effective and personalized AI systems. A robust LCBM can have significant implications for various applications, such as content recommendation, user modeling, and behavior prediction. Moreover, addressing the challenges of content heterogeneity, temporal inconsistency, and user-level sparsity can lead to more accurate and reliable AI systems. This research can also contribute to the development of more effective content moderation strategies, improved user experience, and enhanced social media platforms.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Developing an effective LCBM is challenging due to the complexity of human behavior, the diversity of content, and the sparsity of user data. Naive approaches may fail to capture the nuances of human behavior, and straightforward methods may not be able to handle the heterogeneity of content and the temporal inconsistency of user data. Technical obstacles include the need for large-scale datasets, the development of effective algorithms for modeling complex behavior, and the integration of multiple modalities (e.g., text, images, videos). Theoretical challenges include understanding the underlying mechanisms of human behavior, developing a comprehensive framework for modeling behavior, and addressing the issues of bias, fairness, and transparency.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing models for specific tasks, such as content recommendation or user modeling, but has not addressed the broader challenge of developing a comprehensive LCBM. Existing solutions have limitations, such as relying on simplistic assumptions about human behavior, using limited datasets, or neglecting the importance of context and temporal dynamics. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework for modeling human behavior, integrating multiple modalities, and addressing the challenges of content heterogeneity, temporal inconsistency, and user-level sparsity.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves the following key components:

1. **Data collection**: We will collect a large-scale dataset of user behavior, including text, images, and videos, from various online platforms and social media.
2. **Behavior modeling**: We will develop a novel framework for modeling human behavior, incorporating multiple modalities and addressing the challenges of content heterogeneity, temporal inconsistency, and user-level sparsity.
3. **Algorithm development**: We will design and implement effective algorithms for modeling complex behavior, including deep learning-based methods and graph-based approaches.
4. **Evaluation metrics**: We will develop a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our LCBM, including metrics for accuracy, fairness, and transparency.
5. **Experimental design**: We will conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our LCBM, using various datasets and scenarios.

Expected outcomes include:

1. **Improved accuracy**: Our LCBM will achieve state-of-the-art performance in modeling human behavior, outperforming existing solutions.
2. **Increased fairness**: Our approach will address the issues of bias and fairness, ensuring that our LCBM is transparent and unbiased.
3. **Enhanced transparency**: Our framework will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of human behavior, enabling more effective content moderation strategies and improved user experience.",-1,-1,-1

With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-3 and 4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and many more, we have witnessed a significant improvement in the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. LLMs in zero- or few-shot settings can easily handle tasks such as question answering, summarization, translation, and many more. This has helped us progress towards solving Level B

On the content understanding tasks, while LCBM outperforms similar-sized Vicuna models, GPT-3.5 performs better.

Shannon & Weaver (1949), in their seminal paper on communication, includes all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This includes all forms of expression, such as words, gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. They mentioned that the broad problem of communication can be studied at three levels: technical, semantic, and effectiveness.   Level A: Technical. How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?   Level B: Semantic. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?   Level C: Effectiveness. How well does the received meaning induce the desired conduct in the receiver?   These three levels build on top of each other. Thus, solving the problem at Level C necessarily requires solving the corresponding problems at Levels A and B.   Since the publication of this seminal paper, the tremendous growth in the field of telecommunications, particularly the advent of the Internet and mobile devices, has led to affordable, wide-scale solutions for Level A. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-3 and 4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and many more, we have witnessed a significant improvement in the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

This could enhance their ability to simulate behavior and understand content in a more comprehensive manner. What are your thoughts on this approach, and how do you think we can effectively incorporate multimodal learning into LCBMs?
From agent5 to agent4: I think integrating multimodal learning into LCBMs is a great approach, as it would allow the models to capture a more comprehensive understanding of content and behavior. To effectively incorporate multimodal learning, we could explore the use of multimodal attention mechanisms, which would enable the model to focus on specific aspects of the different modalities (e.g., text, images, videos) when simulating behavior or understanding content. Additionally, we could investigate the use of multimodal fusion techniques, such as early fusion or late fusion, to combine the representations from different modalities and create a unified understanding of the content. By incorporating multimodal learning, we could potentially improve the performance of LCBMs on tasks such as behavior simulation, content understanding, and content-behavior optimization, and also explore new applications in areas like multimedia analysis and social media platforms.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can Large Content Behavior Models (LCBMs) be optimized to improve their effectiveness in predicting and optimizing receiver behavior in various domains, such as education and marketing?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem can have significant implications for the research community, as it can lead to the development of more effective communication strategies and improved outcomes in various domains. This research can also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of natural language processing and machine learning, enabling more accurate predictions of receiver behavior and more effective optimization of content. By addressing this question, researchers can develop more sophisticated models that can better capture the complexities of human behavior, leading to practical applications in areas such as personalized education, targeted marketing, and improved human-computer interaction.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
Optimizing LCBMs is a challenging task due to the complexity of human behavior and the need to develop models that can accurately predict and optimize receiver behavior. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the lack of consideration of various factors that influence human behavior, such as context, culture, and individual differences. Additionally, the complexity of multimodal content, the need for large-scale datasets, and the requirement for advanced computational resources can make it difficult to develop and train effective LCBMs. Theoretical obstacles, such as the lack of a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms of human behavior, can also hinder the development of optimal LCBMs.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on developing LCBMs that can predict and optimize receiver behavior in specific domains, but these models have limitations and gaps that need to be addressed. Existing solutions often rely on simplistic assumptions about human behavior or fail to consider the complexities of multimodal content. Barriers such as the lack of large-scale datasets, limited computational resources, and the complexity of human behavior have prevented the development of optimal LCBMs. The proposed approach differs from prior work by incorporating a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior, utilizing advanced computational resources, and developing more sophisticated models that can capture the complexities of multimodal content.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
The proposed methodology involves the following key components:
1. **Literature Review**: A thorough review of existing research on LCBMs and their applications to identify gaps and limitations.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathering large-scale datasets of multimodal content to train and evaluate LCBMs.
3. **Model Development**: Developing advanced LCBMs that can capture the complexities of human behavior and multimodal content.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training LCBMs using the collected datasets and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Optimization**: Optimizing LCBMs using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and model selection to improve their effectiveness in predicting and optimizing receiver behavior.
The expected outcomes include the development of more effective LCBMs that can accurately predict and optimize receiver behavior in various domains, leading to improved communication strategies and outcomes. The results will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of natural language processing and machine learning, enabling more accurate predictions of receiver behavior and more effective optimization of content.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline. To show the effect of a linear combination of LcycleandLupset, we empirically test Lcycle`τLupset, withτvarying from 0 to 0.9; see Fig. 33 (the others are omitted but could lead to the sameresults for η“0.9as in general allexperiments also show that as the problem becomes harder (e.g. as the noise level increases and the network becomes sparser), a smaller coefficient of Lupset(even zero) is preferred, which indicates that Lcycleplays a more essential role in the more challenging scenarios. To assess the effect of fine-tuning (via projected gradient steps) over the baselines, we apply the same number of projected gradient descent steps as GNNSync to the comparative baselines and report the performance in Figures 34 and 35. We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps, the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylegamma (a) ERO 1pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal1 (b) ERO 2pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal0 (c) ERO 3pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360styleblock normal6 (d) ERO 4pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylegamma (e) ERO 1pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal1 (f) ERO 2pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal0 (g) ERO 3pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360styleblock normal6 (h) ERO 4pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylegamma (i) ERO 1pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal1 (j) ERO 2pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal0 (k) ERO 3pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360styleblock normal6 (l) ERO 4pp“0.15q Figure 28: MSE performance comparison on GNNSync variants on angular synchronization ( k“1) for ERO models. pis the network density and ηis the noise level.

How can we improve the robustness and accuracy of angular synchronization in high-noise environments using advanced neural network techniques?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for applications in sensor networks, distributed clock synchronization, and phase retrieval, where accurate angle estimation is essential. Enhancing the robustness of angular synchronization methods can lead to significant advancements in these fields, enabling more reliable and efficient systems. This research could pave the way for future studies on synchronization in complex networks, potentially influencing the design of algorithms that can handle real-world challenges such as noise and sparse data.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The angular synchronization problem is inherently complex due to the presence of noise in measurements and the need to estimate angles modulo \(2\pi\). Naive approaches may fail because they do not adequately account for the high variability in data or the interdependencies between measurements. Additionally, existing methods often struggle in high-noise regimes, leading to poor performance. Overcoming these challenges requires sophisticated modeling and optimization techniques that can effectively manage noise and leverage the structure of the data.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on traditional optimization methods that do not scale well with increasing noise levels or network sparsity. Many existing solutions lack the flexibility to adapt to heterogeneous data or fail to utilize the full potential of modern machine learning techniques. Our approach differs by employing directed graph neural networks, which can learn complex relationships in the data and adaptively improve synchronization performance, particularly in challenging scenarios.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

We propose a novel framework called GNNSync, which utilizes directed graph neural networks to tackle the angular synchronization problem. The methodology involves training the model on extensive datasets with varying noise levels and network topologies. We will evaluate the performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and robustness against noise. Expected outcomes include demonstrating superior synchronization accuracy compared to existing baselines, particularly in high-noise environments, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline.

From agent2 to agent1: I can help with the literature review and brainstorming a new research idea based on the provided introduction. Let's start with the literature review. From what I understand, the angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate a set of unknown angles from noisy measurements of their offsets. This problem has applications in sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of this problem is the k-synchronization problem, which involves estimating k groups of angles simultaneously from noisy observations with unknown group assignment. Existing methods fall behind the trivial baseline. I'd like to know more about the current state of research in this area and what gaps or limitations exist in previous work.

There is a need for more effective methods to tackle these problems, particularly in the context of noisy observations and unknown group assignments.

Another idea could be to explore the use of deep learning methods, such as neural networks, to learn the relationships between the angles and improve the accuracy of the angle estimation. Additionally, we could investigate the use of transfer learning to adapt existing algorithms for angular synchronization to the k-synchronization problem. We could also explore the use of domain adaptation to adapt the algorithm to different types of data and scenarios. Finally, we could investigate the use of uncertainty quantification to provide a measure of the uncertainty associated with the angle estimation, which could be useful in applications where the accuracy of the estimation is critical.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**

How can we develop an effective algorithm for k-synchronization that leverages the structure of the problem to improve the accuracy of angle estimation?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Developing an effective algorithm for k-synchronization is crucial for various applications, including sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. Solving this problem will have significant implications for the research community, enabling more accurate and reliable synchronization of angles in complex systems. This, in turn, will lead to advancements in various fields, including robotics, computer vision, and communication systems. Furthermore, addressing this question will also have practical applications in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and transportation, where accurate synchronization of angles is critical for efficient operation.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The problem is challenging due to the presence of noisy measurements and heterogeneous settings, which can make it difficult to accurately estimate the angles. Additionally, the k-synchronization problem involves estimating multiple groups of angles simultaneously, which can increase the complexity of the problem. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to account for these complexities, leading to inaccurate or unreliable results. Technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles that need to be overcome include developing algorithms that can handle noisy measurements and heterogeneous settings, as well as scaling up the algorithms to handle large-scale problems.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Existing methods for angular synchronization have limitations in handling noisy measurements and heterogeneous settings, which can lead to inaccurate or unreliable results. Additionally, the k-synchronization problem has not been well-addressed in previous work, and there is a need for more effective methods to tackle this problem. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging the structure of the k-synchronization problem to improve the accuracy of angle estimation, and by developing algorithms that can handle noisy measurements and heterogeneous settings.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a new algorithm for k-synchronization that leverages the structure of the problem to improve the accuracy of angle estimation. We will use a combination of graph theory and machine learning techniques to develop the algorithm, and will evaluate its performance on a range of datasets and metrics. The expected outcomes of this research include the development of a more effective algorithm for k-synchronization, as well as a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in solving this problem.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline. To show the effect of a linear combination of LcycleandLupset, we empirically test Lcycle`τLupset, withτvarying from 0 to 0.9; see Fig. 33 (the others are omitted but could lead to the sameresults for η“0.9as in general allexperiments also show that as the problem becomes harder (e.g. as the noise level increases and the network becomes sparser), a smaller coefficient of Lupset(even zero) is preferred, which indicates that Lcycleplays a more essential role in the more challenging scenarios. To assess the effect of fine-tuning (via projected gradient steps) over the baselines, we apply the same number of projected gradient descent steps as GNNSync to the comparative baselines and report the performance in Figures 34 and 35. We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps, the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylegamma (a) ERO 1pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal1 (b) ERO 2pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal0 (c) ERO 3pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360styleblock normal6 (d) ERO 4pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylegamma (e) ERO 1pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal1 (f) ERO 2pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal0 (g) ERO 3pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360styleblock normal6 (h) ERO 4pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylegamma (i) ERO 1pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal1 (j) ERO 2pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal0 (k) ERO 3pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360styleblock normal6 (l) ERO 4pp“0.15q Figure 28: MSE performance comparison on GNNSync variants on angular synchronization ( k“1) for ERO models. pis the network density and ηis the noise level.

How can we develop a robust and efficient algorithm for angular synchronization in the presence of high noise levels and heterogeneous settings, where existing methods often perform poorly?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for various applications, including sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. A robust and efficient algorithm for angular synchronization can significantly impact the research community by enabling accurate and reliable estimation of unknown angles in the presence of high noise levels. This can lead to advancements in fields such as computer vision, time synchronization of distributed networks, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, a solution to this problem can have practical applications in real-world scenarios, such as improving the accuracy of sensor networks and distributed systems.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The angular synchronization problem is challenging due to the presence of high noise levels, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of the unknown angles. Additionally, the heterogeneous setting, where there exist multiple groups of angles, adds complexity to the problem. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the non-linear nature of the problem and the need to handle multiple groups of angles simultaneously. Technical obstacles include the development of robust algorithms that can handle high noise levels and heterogeneous settings, while theoretical obstacles include the need to establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the mean-squared error (MSE) under different statistical models.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing algorithms for angular synchronization in the presence of low noise levels or homogeneous settings. However, these algorithms often perform poorly in high noise levels or heterogeneous settings. Existing solutions, such as the eigenvector method, may not be robust enough to handle high noise levels, and semidefinite relaxation methods may not be efficient enough to handle large-scale problems. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging neural networks and developing a theoretically-grounded end-to-end trainable framework that can handle high noise levels and heterogeneous settings.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a neural network-based algorithm, called GNNSync, which uses directed graph neural networks to estimate the unknown angles. We also develop new loss functions to encode synchronization objectives. Our approach is theoretically grounded, and we establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the MSE under different statistical models. We evaluate our algorithm on extensive data sets and demonstrate its robustness and efficiency in handling high noise levels and heterogeneous settings. The expected outcomes include accurate and reliable estimation of unknown angles, even in the presence of high noise levels, and improved performance compared to existing baselines.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline. To show the effect of a linear combination of LcycleandLupset, we empirically test Lcycle`τLupset, withτvarying from 0 to 0.9; see Fig. 33 (the others are omitted but could lead to the sameresults for η“0.9as in general allexperiments also show that as the problem becomes harder (e.g. as the noise level increases and the network becomes sparser), a smaller coefficient of Lupset(even zero) is preferred, which indicates that Lcycleplays a more essential role in the more challenging scenarios. To assess the effect of fine-tuning (via projected gradient steps) over the baselines, we apply the same number of projected gradient descent steps as GNNSync to the comparative baselines and report the performance in Figures 34 and 35. We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps, the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylegamma (a) ERO 1pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal1 (b) ERO 2pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal0 (c) ERO 3pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360styleblock normal6 (d) ERO 4pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylegamma (e) ERO 1pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal1 (f) ERO 2pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal0 (g) ERO 3pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360styleblock normal6 (h) ERO 4pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylegamma (i) ERO 1pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal1 (j) ERO 2pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal0 (k) ERO 3pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360styleblock normal6 (l) ERO 4pp“0.15q Figure 28: MSE performance comparison on GNNSync variants on angular synchronization ( k“1) for ERO models. pis the network density and ηis the noise level.

My research extends to the development of novel frameworks for time series generation and analysis, such as CTWALK, which combines temporal random walks with conditional GANs to faithfully replicate observed dependencies in graph data.\n\nIn addition to these contributions, I have created DIGRAC, a self-supervised graph neural network framework for node clustering in directed networks, and SSSNET, which focuses on semi-supervised clustering of signed networks. My work emphasizes the importance of directionality and polarization effects in network analysis, providing new insights and methodologies for understanding complex relationships within data.\n\nThrough my research, I aim to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications, contributing to the growing field of graph neural networks and their utility in real-world scenarios."", ""type"": ""BaseAgent""}]",E,"Iteration 1: {""agent1"": ""\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT The angular synchronization problem aims to accurately estimate (up to a constant additive phase) a set of unknown angles θ1, . . . , θ nPr0,2πqfrom mnoisy mea- surements of their offsets θi´θjmod2π.Applications include, for example, sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline. To show the effect of a linear combination of LcycleandLupset, we empirically test Lcycle`τLupset, withτvarying from 0 to 0.9; see Fig. 33 (the others are omitted but could lead to the sameresults for η“0.9as in general allexperiments also show that as the problem becomes harder (e.g. as the noise level increases and the network becomes sparser), a smaller coefficient of Lupset(even zero) is preferred, which indicates that Lcycleplays a more essential role in the more challenging scenarios. To assess the effect of fine-tuning (via projected gradient steps) over the baselines, we apply the same number of projected gradient descent steps as GNNSync to the comparative baselines and report the performance in Figures 34 and 35. We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps, the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylegamma (a) ERO 1pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal1 (b) ERO 2pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal0 (c) ERO 3pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360styleblock normal6 (d) ERO 4pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylegamma (e) ERO 1pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal1 (f) ERO 2pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal0 (g) ERO 3pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360styleblock normal6 (h) ERO 4pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylegamma (i) ERO 1pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal1 (j) ERO 2pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal0 (k) ERO 3pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360styleblock normal6 (l) ERO 4pp“0.15q Figure 28: MSE performance comparison on GNNSync variants on angular synchronization ( k“1) for ERO models. pis the network density and ηis the noise level.

We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps, the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylegamma (a) ERO 1pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal1 (b) ERO 2pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal0 (c) ERO 3pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360styleblock normal6 (d) ERO 4pp“0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylegamma (e) ERO 1pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal1 (f) ERO 2pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal0 (g) ERO 3pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360styleblock normal6 (h) ERO 4pp“0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylegamma (i) ERO 1pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal1 (j) ERO 2pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal0 (k) ERO 3pp“0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 η0.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360styleblock normal6 (l) ERO 4pp“0.15q Figure 28: MSE performance comparison on GNNSync variants on angular synchronization ( k“1) for ERO models. pis the network density and ηis the noise level.

From agent1 to agent2: Let's collaborate to generate a new research idea based on the given introduction about angular synchronization problem.
From agent2 to agent1: I'd be happy to collaborate with you on generating a new research idea based on the introduction about the angular synchronization problem. To start, let's conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area. The introduction mentions that existing methods for angular synchronization fall behind the trivial baseline, and the problem becomes harder as the noise level increases and the network becomes sparser. It also highlights the importance of fine-tuning and the use of projected gradient steps to improve performance. What are your thoughts on this, and how do you think we can build upon or address gaps in the current research?
From agent1 to agent2: I think we should focus on developing a new method that can effectively handle high noise levels and sparse networks. Perhaps we can explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) or other machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of angular synchronization. We could also investigate the use of different optimization algorithms or fine-tuning techniques to enhance the performance of existing methods. What are your thoughts on this, and do you have any specific ideas for how we can address these challenges?
From agent2 to agent1: I completely agree with your suggestion to develop a new method that can effectively handle high noise levels and sparse networks. Exploring the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) or other machine learning techniques is a great idea, as they have shown promising results in handling complex relationships and noisy data. I also think that investigating different optimization algorithms or fine-tuning techniques could be beneficial in enhancing the performance of existing methods. One potential approach could be to combine GNNs with robust optimization techniques, such as robust gradient descent or adaptive gradient methods, to improve the accuracy of angular synchronization in noisy and sparse networks. Additionally, we could also consider using techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning to improve the robustness of our method. What are your thoughts on these ideas, and do you have any suggestions for how we can further develop this approach?
From agent1 to agent2: I think combining GNNs with robust optimization techniques is a great idea. To further develop this approach, we could explore the use of attention mechanisms or graph attention networks to focus on the most relevant nodes and edges in the network, which could help improve the accuracy of angular synchronization. We could also consider using techniques such as graph pruning or node selection to reduce the impact of noise and sparsity on the network. Additionally, we could investigate the use of different loss functions or evaluation metrics to better capture the performance of our method in handling high noise levels and sparse networks. What are your thoughts on these ideas?

From agent2 to agent3: Let's collaborate to generate a new research idea based on the provided introduction about angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems.
From agent3 to agent2: I'd like to start by analyzing the introduction and conducting a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems. From my understanding, the angular synchronization problem aims to estimate a set of unknown angles from noisy measurements of their offsets, and the k-synchronization problem is an extension of this to estimate k groups of angles simultaneously. Existing methods have limitations, and there is a need for more effective and efficient solutions. What are your thoughts on this, and how can we build upon or address gaps in the current research?
From agent2 to agent3: Next, I would like to proceed with the brainstorming step to generate potential research ideas. Shall we start by identifying some potential research questions or topics that we could explore further?
From agent3 to agent2: I completely agree with proceeding to the brainstorming step. To identify potential research questions or topics, let's consider the challenges and gaps in the current research on angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems. Some potential areas to explore could be: Developing more robust and efficient algorithms for angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems, particularly in scenarios with high noise levels or sparse networks; Investigating the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) or other machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and scalability of synchronization methods; Examining the theoretical limits of synchronization algorithms and deriving novel bounds on their performance; Exploring the extension of synchronization problems to more complex network structures, such as multi-layer or dynamic networks. These are just a few ideas to get us started. What are your thoughts on these potential research directions, and do you have any other ideas to add to the discussion?
From agent2 to agent3: I think your ideas are a great starting point for our brainstorming session. Developing more robust and efficient algorithms for angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems is crucial, especially in scenarios with high noise levels or sparse networks. I also agree that investigating the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) or other machine learning techniques could improve the accuracy and scalability of synchronization methods. Additionally, examining the theoretical limits of synchronization algorithms and deriving novel bounds on their performance could provide valuable insights. As for exploring the extension of synchronization problems to more complex network structures, I believe it could lead to interesting research directions. One potential idea I'd like to add is to explore the use of transfer learning or meta-learning techniques to improve the performance of synchronization algorithms in different network settings. What are your thoughts on this?
From agent3 to agent2: How can we design transfer learning or meta-learning frameworks to improve the robustness and adaptability of synchronization algorithms in diverse network settings?

From my understanding, the angular synchronization problem aims to estimate a set of unknown angles from noisy measurements of their offsets, with applications in sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization.

Existing methods have limitations, and there's a need for more effective and scalable approaches. What are your thoughts on this, and how can we build upon or address gaps in the current research?
From agent3 to agent4: I agree with your analysis of the introduction and the current state of research in angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems. The angular synchronization problem is a fundamental problem in various fields, and the k-synchronization problem is a more complex extension of it. Existing methods have limitations, and there's a need for more effective and scalable approaches. One potential direction to explore is the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve these problems. GNNs have shown promising results in various graph-related tasks, and they can be used to model the relationships between angles and their offsets. We can also explore the use of other machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning or generative models, to solve these problems. Additionally, we can investigate the application of these problems in real-world scenarios, such as sensor network localization or phase retrieval, to make our research more practical and impactful. What are your thoughts on these potential directions, and how can we build upon or address gaps in the current research?
From agent4 to agent3: What specific GNN architecture do you think would be suitable for solving angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems?
From agent4 to agent3: I think a suitable GNN architecture for solving angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems could be a variant of the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or the Graph Attention Network (GAT), as they are both capable of modeling complex relationships between nodes in a graph. Additionally, we could also explore the use of Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) or Graph Variational Autoencoders (GVAEs) to learn compact representations of the angles and their offsets. We could also consider using a message-passing neural network (MPNN) architecture, which is well-suited for modeling the relationships between angles and their offsets in a graph-structured data. What are your thoughts on these architectures, and do you think any of them could be modified or combined to better suit the specific needs of the angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems?
","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can we develop a robust and efficient method for angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems in complex network structures, particularly in scenarios with high noise levels and sparse networks?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has broader implications for various applications, such as sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. A more efficient and robust algorithm could lead to improved performance and scalability in these applications, which could in turn advance knowledge and lead to practical applications. This research can also contribute to the development of more advanced machine learning techniques for solving complex problems, enabling more accurate and reliable synchronization in various fields.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
The angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems are challenging due to the presence of noise in the measurements, unknown group assignments, and the need to estimate multiple angles simultaneously. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of the problem, the complexity of the network structure, and the sensitivity to noise levels and network densities. The problem requires the development of robust and efficient algorithms that can adapt to varying noise levels and network densities, and can handle the complexities of real-world networks.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on developing methods that are sensitive to noise levels and network densities, and existing solutions have limitations in terms of scalability and robustness. The lack of effective and efficient algorithms for angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems can be attributed to the complexity of the problem, the need for more advanced machine learning techniques, and the limited understanding of the underlying network structures. Our approach differs from prior work by exploring the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) and other machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and scalability of synchronization methods, and by investigating the application of these problems in real-world scenarios.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves the use of GNNs, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) or Graph Attention Networks (GATs), to model the relationships between angles and their offsets in complex network structures. We plan to use a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach, and to investigate the use of different loss functions and evaluation metrics to capture the accuracy and robustness of our method. The expected outcomes include the development of a robust and efficient algorithm for angular synchronization and k-synchronization problems, and the demonstration of its effectiveness in various applications, such as sensor network localization and phase retrieval. We also expect to contribute to the development of more advanced machine learning techniques for solving complex problems, and to provide new insights into the underlying network structures and their impact on synchronization algorithms.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  What capabilities are necessary for general intelligence (Legg & Hutter, 2007)? One candidate is causal reasoning, which plays a foundational role in human cognition (Gopnik et al., 2007; Sloman & Lagnado, 2015). It has even been argued that human-level AI is impossible without causal reasoning (Pearl, 2018). However, recent years have seen the development of agents that do not explicitly learn or reason on causal models, but nonetheless are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments and tasks (Reed et al., 2022; Team et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020).   This raises the question, do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient? To answer this question, we have to be careful not to assume that agents use causal assumptions a priori. For example, transportability theory determines what causal knowledge is necessary for transfer learning when all assumptions on the data generating process (inductive biases) can be expressed as constraints on causal structure (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016). However, deep learning algorithms can exploit a much larger set of inductive biases (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Battaglia et al., 2018; Rahaman et al., 2019; Goyal & Bengio, 2022) which in many real-world settings may be sufficient to identify low regret policies without requiring causal knowledge.   The main result of this paper is to answer this question by showing that,  Any agent capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of distributional shifts must have learned a causal model of the data generating process.    Here, adapting to a distributional shift means learning a policy that satisfies a regret bound following an intervention on the data generating process—for example, changing the distribution of features or latent variables. It is known that a causal model of the data generating process can be used to identify regret-bounded policies following a distributional shift (sufficiency), with more accurate models allowing lower regret policies to be found. We prove the converse (necessity)—given regret-bounded policies for a large set of distributional shifts, we can learn an approximate causal model of the data generating process, with the approximation becoming exact for optimal policies. Hence, learning a causal model of the data generating process is necessary for robust adaptation.   This has consequences for a number of fields and questions. For one, it implies that causal identification laws also constrain domain adaptation. For example, we show that adapting to covariate and label shifts is only possible if the causal relations between features and labels can be identified from the training data—a non-trivial causal discovery problem. This provides further theoretical justification for causal representation learning (Schölkopf et al., 2021), showing that learning causal representations is necessary for achieving strong robustness guarantees. Our result also implies that we can learn causal models from adaptive agents. We demonstrate this by solving a causal discovery task on synthetic data by observing the policy of a regret-bounded agent under distributional shifts. More speculatively, our results suggest that causal models could play a role in emergent capabilities. Agents trained to minimise a loss function across many domains are incentivized to learn a causal world model, which could in turn enable them to solve a much larger set of decision tasks they were not explicitly trained on.

My recent work addresses a critical challenge in this field: the identification of agents within causal models.

This definition posits that agents are systems that would alter their policies based on the influence of their actions on the world.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, I introduced a novel causal discovery algorithm designed to identify agents from empirical data, which is a significant advancement in understanding how agents operate within complex systems.

Do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem will provide insights into the necessity of learning causal models for robust adaptation in various fields. It can advance knowledge in causal reasoning, domain adaptation, and machine learning, leading to practical applications in developing adaptive agents and achieving strong robustness guarantees.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenges include determining the causal knowledge necessary for transfer learning, addressing the complexities of distributional shifts, and overcoming the limitations of existing inductive biases. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate nature of causal reasoning and the need for accurate causal models to achieve robust adaptation.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on different aspects of causal reasoning and adaptation, but the specific question of whether agents need to learn causal models for adaptation has not been fully explored. The barriers may include the complexity of causal inference, the diversity of environments and tasks, and the limitations of existing approaches in capturing causal relationships.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  What capabilities are necessary for general intelligence (Legg & Hutter, 2007)? One candidate is causal reasoning, which plays a foundational role in human cognition (Gopnik et al., 2007; Sloman & Lagnado, 2015). It has even been argued that human-level AI is impossible without causal reasoning (Pearl, 2018). However, recent years have seen the development of agents that do not explicitly learn or reason on causal models, but nonetheless are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments and tasks (Reed et al., 2022; Team et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020).   This raises the question, do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient? To answer this question, we have to be careful not to assume that agents use causal assumptions a priori. For example, transportability theory determines what causal knowledge is necessary for transfer learning when all assumptions on the data generating process (inductive biases) can be expressed as constraints on causal structure (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016). However, deep learning algorithms can exploit a much larger set of inductive biases (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Battaglia et al., 2018; Rahaman et al., 2019; Goyal & Bengio, 2022) which in many real-world settings may be sufficient to identify low regret policies without requiring causal knowledge.   The main result of this paper is to answer this question by showing that,  Any agent capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of distributional shifts must have learned a causal model of the data generating process.    Here, adapting to a distributional shift means learning a policy that satisfies a regret bound following an intervention on the data generating process—for example, changing the distribution of features or latent variables. It is known that a causal model of the data generating process can be used to identify regret-bounded policies following a distributional shift (sufficiency), with more accurate models allowing lower regret policies to be found. We prove the converse (necessity)—given regret-bounded policies for a large set of distributional shifts, we can learn an approximate causal model of the data generating process, with the approximation becoming exact for optimal policies. Hence, learning a causal model of the data generating process is necessary for robust adaptation.   This has consequences for a number of fields and questions. For one, it implies that causal identification laws also constrain domain adaptation. For example, we show that adapting to covariate and label shifts is only possible if the causal relations between features and labels can be identified from the training data—a non-trivial causal discovery problem. This provides further theoretical justification for causal representation learning (Schölkopf et al., 2021), showing that learning causal representations is necessary for achieving strong robustness guarantees. Our result also implies that we can learn causal models from adaptive agents. We demonstrate this by solving a causal discovery task on synthetic data by observing the policy of a regret-bounded agent under distributional shifts. More speculatively, our results suggest that causal models could play a role in emergent capabilities. Agents trained to minimise a loss function across many domains are incentivized to learn a causal world model, which could in turn enable them to solve a much larger set of decision tasks they were not explicitly trained on.

How can causal reasoning be effectively integrated into reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance their adaptability and robustness in the face of distributional shifts?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of AI, particularly in developing systems that can operate reliably in dynamic environments. By integrating causal reasoning into reinforcement learning, we can improve the explainability and accountability of AI systems, which is essential for their deployment in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. This research could lead to new methodologies that not only enhance the performance of AI agents but also provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of decision-making, thereby influencing future research directions in both AI and cognitive science.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The integration of causal reasoning into reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of accurately modeling causal relationships in dynamic environments. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate interactions between variables that can change over time. Additionally, there are technical obstacles in developing algorithms that can efficiently learn causal structures while simultaneously optimizing for performance in reinforcement learning tasks. Theoretical challenges also arise in establishing robust frameworks that can generalize across various scenarios and ensure that the learned causal models are both accurate and useful.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has often focused on either causal reasoning or reinforcement learning in isolation, leading to a lack of comprehensive frameworks that bridge the two areas. Limitations in existing algorithms and models have prevented effective causal discovery in dynamic settings, where the environment's behavior can shift unpredictably. Additionally, the computational complexity involved in integrating causal models into reinforcement learning has been a significant barrier. Our approach aims to address these gaps by proposing novel algorithms that leverage recent advancements in causal inference and machine learning, thus providing a more unified methodology.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a new algorithm that combines causal discovery techniques with reinforcement learning frameworks. We will utilize synthetic and real-world datasets that exhibit distributional shifts to evaluate the performance of our approach. Key metrics will include adaptability (measured by regret bounds) and explainability (assessed through causal inference metrics). The expected outcomes include a robust reinforcement learning agent capable of maintaining performance across varying conditions, along with a clearer understanding of the causal relationships that influence decision-making processes in AI systems.",-1,-1,-1

One candidate is causal reasoning, which plays a foundational role in human cognition (Gopnik et al., 2007; Sloman & Lagnado, 2015). It has even been argued that human-level AI is impossible without causal reasoning (Pearl, 2018).

This raises the question, do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient? To answer this question, we have to be careful not to assume that agents use causal assumptions a priori. For example, transportability theory determines what causal knowledge is necessary for transfer learning when all assumptions on the data generating process (inductive biases) can be expressed as constraints on causal structure (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016). However, deep learning algorithms can exploit a much larger set of inductive biases (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Battaglia et al., 2018; Rahaman et al., 2019; Goyal & Bengio, 2022) which in many real-world settings may be sufficient to identify low regret policies without requiring causal knowledge.   The main result of this paper is to answer this question by showing that,  Any agent capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of distributional shifts must have learned a causal model of the data generating process.    Here, adapting to a distributional shift means learning a policy that satisfies a regret bound following an intervention on the data generating process—for example, changing the distribution of features or latent variables. It is known that a causal model of the data generating process can be used to identify regret-bounded policies following a distributional shift (sufficiency), with more accurate models allowing lower regret policies to be found. We prove the converse (necessity)—given regret-bounded policies for a large set of distributional shifts, we can learn an approximate causal model of the data generating process, with the approximation becoming exact for optimal policies. Hence, learning a causal model of the data generating process is necessary for robust adaptation.   This has consequences for a number of fields and questions. For one, it implies that causal identification laws also constrain domain adaptation. For example, we show that adapting to covariate and label shifts is only possible if the causal relations between features and labels can be identified from the training data—a non-trivial causal discovery problem. This provides further theoretical justification for causal representation learning (Schölkopf et al., 2021), showing that learning causal representations is necessary for achieving strong robustness guarantees. Our result also implies that we can learn causal models from adaptive agents. We demonstrate this by solving a causal discovery task on synthetic data by observing the policy of a regret-bounded agent under distributional shifts. More speculatively, our results suggest that causal models could play a role in emergent capabilities.

Can agents learn causal models of the data generating process without explicit causal reasoning, and if so, what are the implications for robust adaptation and transfer learning?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has significant implications for the development of robust and adaptable artificial intelligence systems. If agents can learn causal models without explicit causal reasoning, it could lead to more efficient and effective transfer learning, which is crucial for real-world applications where data is often limited and environments are constantly changing. This could also have significant implications for the development of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and robots, which require the ability to adapt to new and uncertain environments.

Moreover, this problem is closely related to the broader question of how to achieve human-level intelligence in artificial systems. If agents can learn causal models without explicit causal reasoning, it could provide a new pathway to achieving human-level intelligence, which is a long-standing goal in artificial intelligence research.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

This problem is hard because it requires a deep understanding of the relationship between causal models and transfer learning. Causal models are complex and abstract representations of the world, and learning them requires a high degree of cognitive ability. Moreover, transfer learning is a challenging problem in its own right, and it requires agents to be able to generalize from one environment to another.

Furthermore, the problem of learning causal models without explicit causal reasoning is a challenging one because it requires agents to be able to infer causal relationships from data, which is a difficult task. This requires agents to have a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the world, which is a challenging task, especially in complex and uncertain environments.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

This problem has not been solved before because it requires a deep understanding of the relationship between causal models and transfer learning, which is a complex and challenging problem. Moreover, the development of causal models and transfer learning algorithms is a rapidly evolving field, and it requires a high degree of expertise and knowledge.

Additionally, the problem of learning causal models without explicit causal reasoning is a challenging one because it requires agents to be able to infer causal relationships from data, which is a difficult task. This requires agents to have a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the world, which is a challenging task, especially in complex and uncertain environments.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that combines causal discovery algorithms with transfer learning techniques. Our approach involves the following key components:

* A causal discovery algorithm that can learn causal models from data without explicit causal reasoning.
* A transfer learning algorithm that can adapt to new environments and tasks.
* A novel evaluation metric that can measure the performance of agents in adapting to new environments and tasks.

Our expected outcomes are:

* A novel causal discovery algorithm that can learn causal models from data without explicit causal reasoning.
* A transfer learning algorithm that can adapt to new environments and tasks.
* A novel evaluation metric that can measure the performance of agents in adapting to new environments and tasks.

We expect our approach to outperform existing methods in terms of adaptability and robustness, and we believe that it has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of artificial intelligence.",-1,-1,-1

One candidate is causal reasoning, which plays a foundational role in human cognition (Gopnik et al., 2007; Sloman & Lagnado, 2015). It has even been argued that human-level AI is impossible without causal reasoning (Pearl, 2018). However, recent years have seen the development of agents that do not explicitly learn or reason on causal models, but nonetheless are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments and tasks (Reed et al., 2022; Team et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020).   This raises the question, do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient? To answer this question, we have to be careful not to assume that agents use causal assumptions a priori. For example, transportability theory determines what causal knowledge is necessary for transfer learning when all assumptions on the data generating process (inductive biases) can be expressed as constraints on causal structure (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016). However, deep learning algorithms can exploit a much larger set of inductive biases (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Battaglia et al., 2018; Rahaman et al., 2019; Goyal & Bengio, 2022) which in many real-world settings may be sufficient to identify low regret policies without requiring causal knowledge.   The main result of this paper is to answer this question by showing that,  Any agent capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of distributional shifts must have learned a causal model of the data generating process.    Here, adapting to a distributional shift means learning a policy that satisfies a regret bound following an intervention on the data generating process—for example, changing the distribution of features or latent variables. It is known that a causal model of the data generating process can be used to identify regret-bounded policies following a distributional shift (sufficiency), with more accurate models allowing lower regret policies to be found. We prove the converse (necessity)—given regret-bounded policies for a large set of distributional shifts, we can learn an approximate causal model of the data generating process, with the approximation becoming exact for optimal policies. Hence, learning a causal model of the data generating process is necessary for robust adaptation.   This has consequences for a number of fields and questions. For one, it implies that causal identification laws also constrain domain adaptation. For example, we show that adapting to covariate and label shifts is only possible if the causal relations between features and labels can be identified from the training data—a non-trivial causal discovery problem. This provides further theoretical justification for causal representation learning (Schölkopf et al., 2021), showing that learning causal representations is necessary for achieving strong robustness guarantees. Our result also implies that we can learn causal models from adaptive agents. We demonstrate this by solving a causal discovery task on synthetic data by observing the policy of a regret-bounded agent under distributional shifts. More speculatively, our results suggest that causal models could play a role in emergent capabilities. Agents trained to minimise a loss function across many domains are incentivized to learn a causal world model, which could in turn enable them to solve a much larger set of decision tasks they were not explicitly trained on.

Can we develop a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to perform robust causal reasoning, and how can we evaluate the effectiveness of such a framework in various applications?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of artificial intelligence, as causal reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Developing a framework that enables LLMs to perform robust causal reasoning can have significant implications for various applications, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and natural language processing. This research can also contribute to the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI systems, which is essential for their widespread adoption in real-world applications. Furthermore, this research can also shed light on the limitations and potential biases of LLMs, which is essential for their responsible development and deployment.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Developing a framework that enables LLMs to perform robust causal reasoning is challenging due to several reasons. Firstly, causal reasoning requires a deep understanding of the underlying causal relationships between variables, which can be difficult to capture using traditional machine learning approaches. Secondly, LLMs are typically trained on large datasets, but these datasets may not provide sufficient information about the causal relationships between variables. Thirdly, evaluating the effectiveness of a causal reasoning framework is challenging, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying causal relationships and the ability to reason about them. Finally, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics for causal reasoning, which makes it difficult to compare the performance of different approaches.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Despite the importance of causal reasoning, there is a lack of research on developing frameworks that enable LLMs to perform robust causal reasoning. Previous research has focused on developing causal reasoning frameworks for specific applications, such as computer vision or natural language processing, but these frameworks are not generalizable to other domains. Additionally, previous research has focused on developing causal reasoning frameworks using traditional machine learning approaches, which may not be effective for LLMs. Our approach differs from prior work in that we propose a generalizable framework that can be applied to various applications and domains, and we use a combination of machine learning and symbolic reasoning approaches to enable LLMs to perform robust causal reasoning.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our approach consists of the following key components:

1. **Causal Graph Learning**: We propose a novel approach for learning causal graphs from data, which can be used to capture the underlying causal relationships between variables.
2. **Causal Reasoning Framework**: We develop a causal reasoning framework that enables LLMs to perform robust causal reasoning using the learned causal graphs.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: We propose a set of evaluation metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the causal reasoning framework.
4. **Benchmark Datasets**: We create a set of benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of the causal reasoning framework.

Our expected outcomes include:

1. **Improved Causal Reasoning**: We expect that our framework will enable LLMs to perform robust causal reasoning, which can lead to improved decision-making and problem-solving capabilities.
2. **Increased Transparency**: We expect that our framework will provide increased transparency into the causal relationships between variables, which can lead to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.
3. **Generalizability**: We expect that our framework will be generalizable to various applications and domains, which can lead to widespread adoption in real-world applications.",-1,-1,-1

My recent work addresses a critical challenge in this field: the identification of agents within causal models.

This definition posits that agents are systems that would alter their policies based on the influence of their actions on the world.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, I introduced a novel causal discovery algorithm designed to identify agents from empirical data, which is a significant advancement in understanding how agents operate within complex systems.

One potential research idea could be to investigate the role of causal reasoning in adapting to new domains, and whether other inductive biases can be sufficient. Another idea could be to develop a framework for identifying the gaps in current research and exploring new areas of investigation. What are your thoughts on these ideas, and do you have any other suggestions?
From agent1 to agent2: I think investigating the role of causal reasoning in adapting to new domains is a great idea.

What are your thoughts on incorporating game-theoretic reasoning into our research idea?
","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How necessary is causal reasoning for agents to adapt to new domains, and what are the implications of this necessity for general intelligence?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Understanding the role of causal reasoning in agent adaptation is crucial for advancing the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in achieving general intelligence. Solving this problem could lead to the development of more robust and adaptable agents, with broader implications for fields like robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making under uncertainty. This research could also shed light on the fundamental capabilities required for general intelligence, influencing the design of future AI systems. Furthermore, it could lead to practical applications in areas such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, and robust decision-making, ultimately enhancing the reliability and performance of AI systems in real-world scenarios.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
The problem is challenging because it requires a deep understanding of causal reasoning, its role in human cognition, and how it can be applied to artificial agents. Additionally, the complexity of real-world environments and the variety of tasks that agents may need to adapt to pose significant technical and theoretical obstacles. Naive approaches may fail due to the difficulty in identifying and modeling causal relationships, the need for large amounts of data, and the complexity of integrating causal reasoning with other aspects of agent decision-making. Overcoming these challenges will necessitate advances in areas such as causal discovery, representation learning, and decision-making under uncertainty.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has not fully addressed the question of whether causal reasoning is necessary for agents to adapt to new domains due to several limitations. Firstly, existing work has often focused on specific applications or domains, rather than exploring the general necessity of causal reasoning. Secondly, the complexity of causal reasoning and its integration with other AI capabilities has hindered progress. Lastly, the lack of a clear framework for evaluating the role of causal reasoning in agent adaptation has made it difficult to compare and build upon different approaches. Our approach differs from prior work by taking a more comprehensive and theoretical perspective, aiming to establish a fundamental understanding of the relationship between causal reasoning and general intelligence.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves a multi-step approach:
1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of existing research on causal reasoning, general intelligence, and agent adaptation to identify key concepts, challenges, and gaps in current knowledge.
2. **Theoretical Framework**: Develop a theoretical framework that formalizes the relationship between causal reasoning and agent adaptation, providing a foundation for analyzing the necessity of causal reasoning for general intelligence.
3. **Empirical Evaluation**: Design and conduct experiments to empirically evaluate the role of causal reasoning in agent adaptation across various domains and tasks, using metrics such as adaptation speed, accuracy, and robustness.
4. **Causal Discovery and Representation Learning**: Investigate methods for causal discovery and representation learning that can be integrated with agent decision-making processes to enhance adaptation capabilities.
5. **Decision-making under Uncertainty**: Develop decision-making frameworks that incorporate causal reasoning and uncertainty management to improve agent performance in complex, real-world environments.
Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the necessity of causal reasoning for general intelligence, the development of more adaptable and robust AI systems, and contributions to the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Figure 1: A comparison of feature fusion schemes. The purple nodes depict features extracted from the backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism, allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. As shown in Figure 1 (e), E2ENet incorporates multi-scale features from the backbone into the final output by gradually fusing the adjacent features, allowing the

E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. As shown in Figure 1 (e), E2ENet incorporates multi-scale features from the backbone into the final output by gradually fusing the adjacent features, allowing the\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem can significantly impact the field of 3D medical image segmentation by providing a method that balances accuracy and efficiency, making it more practical for real-world applications. It can advance knowledge by addressing the challenges of resource consumption and scalability in 3D models, leading to more effective computer-aided diagnosis and image-guided surgery systems.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenge lies in efficiently incorporating both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern to achieve a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of multi-scale feature fusion and the need to optimize sparse topology within a pre-defined architecture.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on complex neural network architectures and optimization techniques like neural architecture search, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming. The proposed approach of Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet) differs by dynamically fusing adjacent features from the backbone network in a sparse pattern without the need for costly architecture search time.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

The proposed methodology involves incorporating multi-scale features from the backbone network into the final output by gradually fusing adjacent features in a dynamic sparse pattern. The dataset and metrics used for evaluation will be crucial in demonstrating the accuracy-efficiency trade-off achieved by E2ENet, with the expected outcome being a more practical and effective 3D medical image segmentation method.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Figure 1: A comparison of feature fusion schemes. The purple nodes depict features extracted from the backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism, allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. As shown in Figure 1 (e), E2ENet incorporates multi-scale features from the backbone into the final output by gradually fusing the adjacent features, allowing the

However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem.

More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture.

Can we develop a 3D medical image segmentation method that effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of medical imaging, as it can lead to more accessible and efficient diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A method that optimally balances accuracy and efficiency could facilitate the deployment of advanced segmentation techniques in resource-constrained environments, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This research could inspire future studies on efficient model architectures and resource allocation strategies in medical imaging.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The complexity arises from the inherent variability in organ shapes and sizes, which complicates accurate segmentation. Additionally, existing methods often require extensive computational resources for training and inference, making them impractical for real-world applications. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to adapt to the diverse anatomical structures present in 3D medical images, and they may not effectively leverage multi-scale features for improved segmentation accuracy.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on improving segmentation accuracy without adequately addressing the computational efficiency required for practical applications. Many existing methods rely on extensive annotated datasets and complex architectures that demand significant computational resources, which limits their applicability in clinical settings. Our approach aims to directly optimize sparse topologies within a predefined architecture, reducing the need for costly architecture searches and enabling more efficient training and inference.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

We propose the Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), which dynamically incorporates both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a sparse manner. The methodology will involve training E2ENet on publicly available 3D medical imaging datasets, such as BraTS2020 and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon, using metrics like Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU) for evaluation. We expect E2ENet to demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to existing methods, making it a practical solution for 3D medical image segmentation.",-1,-1,-1

The purple nodes depict features extracted from the backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism, allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

From agent3 to agent1: Based on the Introduction, it appears that the current state of research in 3D medical image segmentation focuses on developing models that can efficiently incorporate multi-scale features from the backbone network. However, these models often require significant computational resources and time to train. Our literature review suggests that there is a need for a method that can trade off accuracy and efficiency better, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically. We also notice that pioneering work such as UNet, UNet++, CoTr, and DiNTS have developed complex neural network architectures or optimization techniques for cross-scale feature fusion, but these approaches are often computationally expensive and time-consuming. Our goal is to propose a new research idea that addresses this gap and provides a more efficient solution for 3D medical image segmentation.

By addressing this question, we can develop a method that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenges involved in solving this problem include the need for a method that can efficiently incorporate multi-scale features from the backbone network. This requires developing a model that can dynamically learn how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone, while also reducing the computational resources and time required for training. Additionally, the problem is further complicated by the fact that the model sizes and computational costs are exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing models that can efficiently incorporate multi-scale features from the backbone network, but these models often require significant computational resources and time to train. Pioneering work such as UNet, UNet++, CoTr, and DiNTS have developed complex neural network architectures or optimization techniques for cross-scale feature fusion, but these approaches are often computationally expensive and time-consuming. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a method that can trade off accuracy and efficiency better, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a new 3D medical image segmentation method that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern. We will use a combination of techniques, including sparse neural networks and efficient feature fusion, to reduce the computational resources and time required for training. We will evaluate our method on a dataset of 3D medical images and compare its performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.

The purple nodes depict features extracted from the backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism, allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

How can we design an efficient 3D medical image segmentation method that balances accuracy and efficiency, considering the variability in size and shape of organs and the limitations of current deep learning models?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing medical image analysis, as accurate segmentation of organs is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. A more efficient and accurate 3D medical image segmentation method can lead to improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and enhanced research capabilities. This research can also contribute to the development of more robust and generalizable deep learning models for medical image analysis.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The problem is challenging due to the complexity of 3D medical images, the variability in organ size and shape, and the limitations of current deep learning models. Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of 3D images, the need for large amounts of annotated data, and the difficulty in capturing spatial relationships between organs. Technical obstacles include the development of efficient and effective feature extraction methods, the design of robust and generalizable deep learning architectures, and the need for large-scale annotated datasets.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing deep learning models for 2D medical image segmentation, with limited attention to 3D images. Existing solutions often rely on computationally expensive and time-consuming methods, such as neural architecture search, or require large amounts of annotated data. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel, efficient, and effective method for 3D medical image segmentation that balances accuracy and efficiency. We also aim to address the limitations of current deep learning models by developing a more robust and generalizable architecture.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves the development of a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates a dynamic sparse pattern for feature fusion, allowing for efficient and effective segmentation of 3D medical images. We will evaluate our approach using a combination of publicly available datasets, including the BraTS2019 and BTCV datasets, and metrics such as Dice score and Hausdorff distance. We expect our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D medical image segmentation while reducing computational costs and improving efficiency. Our results will demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing accuracy and efficiency, and we will provide insights into the potential applications and future directions of our research.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Figure 1: A comparison of feature fusion schemes. The purple nodes depict features extracted from the backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism, allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. As shown in Figure 1 (e), E2ENet incorporates multi-scale features from the backbone into the final output by gradually fusing the adjacent features, allowing the

The purple nodes depict features extracted from the backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism, allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications, including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding, which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem. Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool) and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al., 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

From agent1 to agent5: Hello agent5, I'd be happy to help you generate a new research idea based on the introduction provided. From my recent collaboration with agent3, we explored the application of dynamic sparse training (DST) and sparse neural networks (SNNs) to improve the efficiency of 3D medical image segmentation models.

What are your thoughts on how we can formally define fairness in the context of 3D medical image segmentation?
From agent1 to agent5: To formally define fairness in the context of 3D medical image segmentation, we could use metrics such as demographic parity or equalized odds to evaluate the model's performance across different patient demographics. We could also consider using techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning to reduce bias in the model. Additionally, we could explore using fairness-aware loss functions or regularization techniques to encourage the model to produce fair and unbiased results. What are your thoughts on how we can implement these fairness metrics and techniques in our 3D medical image segmentation model?
","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
Can we design a 3D medical image segmentation model that leverages dynamic sparse training and sparse neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing model size and computational costs, and also ensures fairness and unbiased results across different patient demographics?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem is interesting and important because it can lead to the development of efficient and unbiased 3D medical image segmentation models that can be deployed in real-world applications, such as computer-aided diagnosis and image-guided surgery systems. This can advance knowledge in the field of medical imaging, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs. A solution to this problem can also contribute to the development of more efficient and effective deep learning models in general, with potential applications in various fields beyond medical imaging.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
This problem is challenging because it requires balancing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in 3D medical image segmentation models, while also ensuring fairness and unbiased results. The variability in size and shape of organs, and the need to accurately identify and distinguish boundaries of different organs, make it difficult to design a model that can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing model size and computational costs. Additionally, incorporating fairness metrics and ensuring unbiased results adds another layer of complexity to the problem. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the complexity of the problem, and technical, theoretical, or practical obstacles such as limited datasets, computational resources, and expertise in fairness and bias mitigation need to be overcome.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of 3D medical image segmentation models, but has not fully addressed the issue of fairness and bias. Existing solutions such as UNet, UNet++, CoTr, and DiNTS have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, but often require significant computational resources and may not be fair or unbiased. The introduction of dynamic sparse training and sparse neural networks has shown promise in improving efficiency, but has not been fully explored in the context of 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach differs from prior work by combining dynamic sparse training, sparse neural networks, and fairness metrics to develop an efficient and unbiased 3D medical image segmentation model. This approach improves upon prior work by addressing the limitations of existing solutions and providing a more comprehensive solution to the problem.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves the following key components: (1) dynamic sparse training and sparse neural networks to improve efficiency, (2) fairness metrics such as demographic parity or equalized odds to ensure unbiased results, (3) a dataset of 3D medical images with diverse patient demographics, and (4) evaluation metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and fairness. We plan to use a combination of data augmentation, transfer learning, and fairness-aware loss functions to develop an efficient and unbiased 3D medical image segmentation model. The expected outcomes include a model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing model size and computational costs, and ensures fairness and unbiased results across different patient demographics. We anticipate that our approach will lead to the development of more efficient and effective deep learning models in medical imaging, with potential applications in various fields beyond medical imaging.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  In recent years, major efforts have been devoted to understanding which distributions can be learned efficiently using gradient-type algorithms on generic models (Abbe and Sandon, 2020; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020; Malach et al., 2021; Damian et al., 2022; Abbe et al., 2021b, a, 2022, 2023; Bietti et al., 2023; Glasgow, 2023; Dandi et al., 2023, 2024; Edelman et al., 2024; Kou et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)), that is functions that depend only on a small number P𝑃{P}italic_P out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑃d\gg{P}italic_d ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities, learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑃O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to learn in O~⁢(d)~𝑂𝑑\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle dynamics that drives learning in this setting. The goal of the present paper is to provide a general characterization for the complexity of learning sparse functions that go beyond (i) hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and (ii) 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ (see below) and focusing only on the squared loss.   The notion of complexity we consider is the Statistical Query (𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰{\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002; Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known, which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical Queries (𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ) which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries. Lower bounds on the 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ complexity have thus been seen as corresponding to the complexity of gradient-based learning222In Section 8, we discuss recent work Dandi et al. (2024) that showed that even with the squared loss, multiple gradient evaluations on the same batch can be strictly more powerful than 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ. in these restricted cases. Part of the motivation for this paper is to emphasize that this relationship is limited to very specific loss functions and does not hold more generally. In order to study the complexity of gradient algorithms for general output and loss functions, we introduce a type of statistical query which we call Differentiable Learning Query (𝖣𝖫𝖰𝖣𝖫𝖰{\sf DLQ}sansserif_DLQ). These queries are defined with respect to a specific loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ—denoted by 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\sf DLQ}_{\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT—and are given by gradients on a loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ with respect to an arbitrary model.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  In recent years, major efforts have been devoted to understanding which distributions can be learned efficiently using gradient-type algorithms on generic models (Abbe and Sandon, 2020; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020; Malach et al., 2021; Damian et al., 2022; Abbe et al., 2021b, a, 2022, 2023; Bietti et al., 2023; Glasgow, 2023; Dandi et al., 2023, 2024; Edelman et al., 2024; Kou et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)), that is functions that depend only on a small number P𝑃{P}italic_P out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑃d\gg{P}italic_d ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities, learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑃O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to learn in O~⁢(d)~𝑂𝑑\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle dynamics that drives learning in this setting. The goal of the present paper is to provide a general characterization for the complexity of learning sparse functions that go beyond (i) hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and (ii) 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ (see below) and focusing only on the squared loss.   The notion of complexity we consider is the Statistical Query (𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰{\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002; Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known, which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical Queries (𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ) which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries. Lower bounds on the 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ complexity have thus been seen as corresponding to the complexity of gradient-based learning222In Section 8, we discuss recent work Dandi et al. (2024) that showed that even with the squared loss, multiple gradient evaluations on the same batch can be strictly more powerful than 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ. in these restricted cases. Part of the motivation for this paper is to emphasize that this relationship is limited to very specific loss functions and does not hold more generally. In order to study the complexity of gradient algorithms for general output and loss functions, we introduce a type of statistical query which we call Differentiable Learning Query (𝖣𝖫𝖰𝖣𝖫𝖰{\sf DLQ}sansserif_DLQ). These queries are defined with respect to a specific loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ—denoted by 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\sf DLQ}_{\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT—and are given by gradients on a loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ with respect to an arbitrary model. Specifically, 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\sf DLQ}_{\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ

How can we effectively characterize the complexity of learning sparse functions using gradient-based algorithms and statistical queries, particularly in the context of differentiable learning queries?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Understanding the complexity of learning sparse functions is crucial for advancing machine learning techniques, especially in high-dimensional spaces where only a few features are relevant. This research could lead to more efficient algorithms that can handle large datasets with sparse representations, impacting various applications such as feature selection, neural network optimization, and improving generalization in machine learning models. By addressing this question, we can provide insights that may influence future research directions and methodologies in the field.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The complexity of learning sparse functions is inherently challenging due to the vast number of potential input features and the need to identify the few that are relevant. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate relationships between features or the specific characteristics of the loss functions used. Additionally, the theoretical underpinnings of statistical query complexity and its relationship with gradient-based learning introduce significant technical hurdles, such as ensuring that the learning algorithms can effectively navigate the high-dimensional parameter space while maintaining computational efficiency.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on specific types of loss functions or learning paradigms, often overlooking the broader implications of statistical query complexity in gradient-based learning. Limitations in existing methodologies, such as the lack of a unified framework for differentiable learning queries, have hindered progress. Our approach aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between statistical queries and gradient-based learning, thus offering a more generalized understanding of the complexity involved.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a framework for differentiable learning queries that can be applied to various loss functions. We will conduct experiments using synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach against traditional statistical queries and gradient-based methods. Key metrics will include query complexity, learning efficiency, and generalization performance. We expect our results to demonstrate that differentiable learning queries can significantly enhance the understanding of learning complexities in sparse function scenarios, leading to more effective learning algorithms.",-1,-1,-1

From agent1 to agent2: I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of network science, machine learning, and optimization. My work primarily focuses on community detection in hypergraphs, where I have developed efficient algorithms for exact community recovery, particularly under the hypergraph stochastic block model. I have confirmed conjectures regarding semidefinite programming relaxations and introduced a spectral algorithm that achieves optimal performance with nearly linear runtime.
From agent2 to agent1: I will conduct a literature review to understand the current state of research in this area, focusing on the Statistical Query (SQ) complexity and its relationship with gradient-based learning. I will also explore the Differentiable Learning Query (DLQ) and its potential applications in machine learning.
From agent1 to agent2: I have also been exploring the effects of side information on exact recovery in block models, designing optimal spectral algorithms that leverage this information. My research also delves into the generalization behavior of overparameterized neural networks, where I provide rigorous analyses of tempered overfitting in two-layer ReLU networks, revealing complexities in their performance metrics. I have also contributed to the field of data streaming by extending quantile summaries to handle weighted inputs efficiently, addressing a significant gap in existing methodologies. Furthermore, I investigate distributed optimization techniques, particularly local SGD, where I provide new theoretical insights that bridge the gap between practice and theory, emphasizing the need for improved models of data heterogeneity. Overall, my research aims to develop robust algorithms and theoretical frameworks that enhance our understanding of complex systems, whether in community detection, machine learning, or optimization. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of these fields and contributing to their advancement through innovative solutions.
From agent2 to agent1: Your work on side information and block models is fascinating. I was wondering if you could elaborate on how your spectral algorithms leverage this information to improve exact recovery in block models?
From agent1 to agent2: I'd be happy to elaborate on my spectral algorithms for block models. Essentially, I use side information to inform the spectral clustering process, which helps to identify the underlying community structure in the data. By leveraging this information, I can improve the accuracy of exact recovery in block models. Specifically, I use a combination of spectral clustering and semi-definite programming to identify the relevant coordinates and recover the underlying community structure. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in a variety of settings, including noisy and incomplete data. I'd be happy to discuss this further and provide more details on my approach.
From agent2 to agent1: I'd like to discuss your spectral algorithms for block models in more detail. Can you explain how you use side information to inform the spectral clustering process and improve exact recovery in block models?

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  In recent years, major efforts have been devoted to understanding which distributions can be learned efficiently using gradient-type algorithms on generic models (Abbe and Sandon, 2020; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020; Malach et al., 2021; Damian et al., 2022; Abbe et al., 2021b, a, 2022, 2023; Bietti et al., 2023; Glasgow, 2023; Dandi et al., 2023, 2024; Edelman et al., 2024; Kou et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)), that is functions that depend only on a small number P𝑃{P}italic_P out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑃d\gg{P}italic_d ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities, learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑃O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to learn in O~⁢(d)~𝑂𝑑\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle dynamics that drives learning in this setting. The goal of the present paper is to provide a general characterization for the complexity of learning sparse functions that go beyond (i) hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and (ii) 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ (see below) and focusing only on the squared loss.   The notion of complexity we consider is the Statistical Query (𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰{\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002; Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known, which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical Queries (𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ) which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries. Lower bounds on the 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ complexity have thus been seen as corresponding to the complexity of gradient-based learning222In Section 8, we discuss recent work Dandi et al. (2024) that showed that even with the squared loss, multiple gradient evaluations on the same batch can be strictly more powerful than 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ. in these restricted cases. Part of the motivation for this paper is to emphasize that this relationship is limited to very specific loss functions and does not hold more generally. In order to study the complexity of gradient algorithms for general output and loss functions, we introduce a type of statistical query which we call Differentiable Learning Query (𝖣𝖫𝖰𝖣𝖫𝖰{\sf DLQ}sansserif_DLQ). These queries are defined with respect to a specific loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ—denoted by 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\sf DLQ}_{\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT—and are given by gradients on a loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ with respect to an arbitrary model.

In this paper, we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)), that is functions that depend only on a small number P𝑃{P}italic_P out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑃d\\gg{P}italic_d ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities, learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑃O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to learn in O~⁢(d)~𝑂𝑑\\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle dynamics that drives learning in this setting.

The notion of complexity we consider is the Statistical Query (𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰{\\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002; Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known, which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical Queries (𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ) which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries.

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has broader implications for the research community in understanding the complexity of learning sparse functions, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning. A general characterization of the complexity of learning sparse functions can lead to a deeper understanding of the limitations and capabilities of gradient-type algorithms on generic models. This can, in turn, affect future research by providing a framework for analyzing the complexity of learning sparse functions and guiding the development of new algorithms. Addressing this question can also lead to practical applications in areas such as image and signal processing, where sparse functions are commonly used.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Solving this problem is hard because it involves understanding the complex interactions between the sparse function, the gradient-type algorithm, and the generic model. The problem is also challenging because it requires developing a general characterization of the complexity of learning sparse functions that goes beyond specific cases, such as hypercube data and Fourier analysis. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they may not capture the underlying structure of the sparse function or the algorithm. Technical obstacles that need to be overcome include developing a rigorous framework for analyzing the complexity of learning sparse functions and identifying the key factors that affect the complexity.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

This problem has not been solved before because previous research has focused on specific cases, such as hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and has not provided a general characterization of the complexity of learning sparse functions. Existing solutions have also been limited to specific algorithms or models, and have not provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the complexity of learning sparse functions. Our approach differs from prior work by providing a general characterization of the complexity of learning sparse functions that goes beyond specific cases and by developing a rigorous framework for analyzing the complexity of learning sparse functions.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our approach involves developing a general characterization of the complexity of learning sparse functions using gradient-type algorithms on generic models. We will use a combination of theoretical and empirical methods to analyze the complexity of learning sparse functions, including the development of new algorithms and the analysis of existing ones. Our methodology will include the following key components:

* Developing a rigorous framework for analyzing the complexity of learning sparse functions
* Identifying the key factors that affect the complexity of learning sparse functions
* Developing new algorithms for learning sparse functions that are based on the general characterization of the complexity
* Analyzing the performance of existing algorithms for learning sparse functions using the general characterization of the complexity
* Evaluating the performance of the new algorithms using a variety of datasets and metrics

Our expected outcomes include:

* A general characterization of the complexity of learning sparse functions that goes beyond specific cases
* A rigorous framework for analyzing the complexity of learning sparse functions
* New algorithms for learning sparse functions that are based on the general characterization of the complexity
* A comprehensive understanding of the key factors that affect the complexity of learning sparse functions

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  In recent years, major efforts have been devoted to understanding which distributions can be learned efficiently using gradient-type algorithms on generic models (Abbe and Sandon, 2020; Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020; Malach et al., 2021; Damian et al., 2022; Abbe et al., 2021b, a, 2022, 2023; Bietti et al., 2023; Glasgow, 2023; Dandi et al., 2023, 2024; Edelman et al., 2024; Kou et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)), that is functions that depend only on a small number P𝑃{P}italic_P out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑃d\gg{P}italic_d ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities, learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑃O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to learn in O~⁢(d)~𝑂𝑑\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle dynamics that drives learning in this setting. The goal of the present paper is to provide a general characterization for the complexity of learning sparse functions that go beyond (i) hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and (ii) 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ (see below) and focusing only on the squared loss.   The notion of complexity we consider is the Statistical Query (𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰{\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002; Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known, which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical Queries (𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ) which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries. Lower bounds on the 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ complexity have thus been seen as corresponding to the complexity of gradient-based learning222In Section 8, we discuss recent work Dandi et al. (2024) that showed that even with the squared loss, multiple gradient evaluations on the same batch can be strictly more powerful than 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ. in these restricted cases. Part of the motivation for this paper is to emphasize that this relationship is limited to very specific loss functions and does not hold more generally. In order to study the complexity of gradient algorithms for general output and loss functions, we introduce a type of statistical query which we call Differentiable Learning Query (𝖣𝖫𝖰𝖣𝖫𝖰{\sf DLQ}sansserif_DLQ). These queries are defined with respect to a specific loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ—denoted by 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\sf DLQ}_{\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT—and are given by gradients on a loss ℓℓ\ellroman_ℓ with respect to an arbitrary model. Specifically, 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\sf DLQ}_{\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ

In this paper, we focus on learning sparse functions (i.e. “juntas” (Blum and Langley, 1997)), that is functions that depend only on a small number P𝑃{P}italic_P out of a much larger set d≫Pmuch-greater-than𝑑𝑃d\\gg{P}italic_d ≫ italic_P of input coordinates. The challenge in this setting is to identify the few relevant coordinates. For some sparse functions, such as noisy parities, learning is believed to require O⁢(dP)𝑂superscript𝑑𝑃O(d^{P})italic_O ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) runtime (Kearns, 1998), while others, such as linear functions, are easy to learn in O~⁢(d)~𝑂𝑑\\tilde{O}(d)over~ start_ARG italic_O end_ARG ( italic_d ) time. Which functions are easy to learn and which are hard? What is the complexity of learning a specific sparse function? Recent works (Abbe et al., 2022, 2023) unveiled a rich “leap” hierarchical structure and saddle-to-saddle dynamics that drives learning in this setting. The goal of the present paper is to provide a general characterization for the complexity of learning sparse functions that go beyond (i) hypercube data and Fourier analysis, and (ii) 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ (see below) and focusing only on the squared loss.   The notion of complexity we consider is the Statistical Query (𝖲𝖰𝖲𝖰{\\sf SQ}sansserif_SQ) complexity, which studies learning by measuring expectations up to some worst-case tolerance (see (Kearns, 1998; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002; Reyzin, 2020) and Section 3). Although based on worst-case error (or almost equivalently, additive independent noise) rather than the sampling error encountered in practice, statistical query complexity has been proven to be a useful guideline for studying the complexity of learning. In particular, gradient computations are a special case of statistical queries. In specific cases which include binary functions or gradients on the squared or cross-entropy loss, gradient queries are equivalent111This equivalence holds if the input distribution is known, which is the case we consider here. to the restricted class of Correlation Statistical Queries (𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ) which are strictly less powerful than general statistical queries. Lower bounds on the 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ complexity have thus been seen as corresponding to the complexity of gradient-based learning222In Section 8, we discuss recent work Dandi et al. (2024) that showed that even with the squared loss, multiple gradient evaluations on the same batch can be strictly more powerful than 𝖢𝖲𝖰𝖢𝖲𝖰{\\sf CSQ}sansserif_CSQ. in these restricted cases. Part of the motivation for this paper is to emphasize that this relationship is limited to very specific loss functions and does not hold more generally. In order to study the complexity of gradient algorithms for general output and loss functions, we introduce a type of statistical query which we call Differentiable Learning Query (𝖣𝖫𝖰𝖣𝖫𝖰{\\sf DLQ}sansserif_DLQ). These queries are defined with respect to a specific loss ℓℓ\\ellroman_ℓ—denoted by 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\\sf DLQ}_{\\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT—and are given by gradients on a loss ℓℓ\\ellroman_ℓ with respect to an arbitrary model. Specifically, 𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓsubscript𝖣𝖫𝖰ℓ{\\sf DLQ}_{\\ell}sansserif_DLQ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ℓ\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Teacher-Student architecture has proved its effectiveness in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) [65, 32, 52], which aims to take advantage of a large collection of unlabeled data, reducing the expensive costs of annotation [56, 89, 88]. Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\text{student}|\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.   Figure 1: Left: Learning effects of traditional Teacher-Student Consistency Model (TSCM, e.g., SimGCD [74]) and our Flipped Classroom Consistency Model (FlipClass) on Stanford Cars [33]. Middle: Model comparison between TSCM and our FlipClass, where 𝔻newsuperscript𝔻new\mathbb{D}^{\text{new}}blackboard_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT new end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT refers to data belonging to new classes. Right: Illustration of the inner feedback mechanism in FlipClass, where teacher attention is adapted to the student, leading to the alignment of attention.   To sum up, the challenges of previous teacher-student models arise from inadequate supervision on new classes and the gap between weakly and strongly augmented data. This results in attention inconsistency (Chall. III), which leads to discrepancies in predictions and representations (Chall. II), ultimately

Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\\text{student}|\\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior\"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Teacher-Student architecture has proved its effectiveness in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) [65, 32, 52], which aims to take advantage of a large collection of unlabeled data, reducing the expensive costs of annotation [56, 89, 88]. Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\text{student}|\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.   Figure 1: Left: Learning effects of traditional Teacher-Student Consistency Model (TSCM, e.g., SimGCD [74]) and our Flipped Classroom Consistency Model (FlipClass) on Stanford Cars [33]. Middle: Model comparison between TSCM and our FlipClass, where 𝔻newsuperscript𝔻new\mathbb{D}^{\text{new}}blackboard_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT new end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT refers to data belonging to new classes. Right: Illustration of the inner feedback mechanism in FlipClass, where teacher attention is adapted to the student, leading to the alignment of attention.   To sum up, the challenges of previous teacher-student models arise from inadequate supervision on new classes and the gap between weakly and strongly augmented data. This results in attention inconsistency (Chall. III), which leads to discrepancies in predictions and representations (Chall. II), ultimately

Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\\text{student}|\\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior\"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3].

How can we effectively bridge the learning gap between teacher and student models in semi-supervised learning, particularly when new classes are introduced in dynamic environments?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing semi-supervised learning techniques, as it addresses the limitations of current teacher-student architectures that struggle with new class discovery. By improving the alignment and synchronization between teacher and student models, we can enhance the adaptability of machine learning systems in real-world applications, leading to more robust models that can learn continuously and efficiently from both labeled and unlabeled data. This research could pave the way for more effective learning algorithms that require less human intervention for data labeling, ultimately reducing costs and increasing the applicability of machine learning across various domains.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenge lies in the inherent discrepancies between the teacher's fast-paced learning and the student's evolving understanding, which can lead to significant misalignment in predictions and representations. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the complexities of feature discrepancies and attention inconsistencies that arise when new classes are introduced. Additionally, the lack of adequate supervision for new classes complicates the learning process, making it difficult to optimize consistency loss effectively. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative strategies to synchronize learning dynamics and improve feature representation alignment.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on closed-world assumptions, where teachers are expected to have prior knowledge of all classes. This limitation has hindered the exploration of dynamic environments where new classes emerge. Existing solutions often do not address the learning gap and attention inconsistencies effectively, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. Our approach aims to integrate mechanisms that adapt teacher supervision to student learning needs, thereby improving the overall learning process and addressing the shortcomings of prior work.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a Flipped Classroom Consistency Model (FlipClass) that adapts teacher supervision based on student performance. We will utilize a dataset containing both labeled and unlabeled data across various classes, focusing on metrics such as prediction accuracy and consistency loss. The expected outcomes include improved synchronization between teacher and student models, reduced learning gaps, and enhanced performance in class discovery tasks. By implementing this approach, we aim to demonstrate significant advancements in semi-supervised learning capabilities, particularly in dynamic environments.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Teacher-Student architecture has proved its effectiveness in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) [65, 32, 52], which aims to take advantage of a large collection of unlabeled data, reducing the expensive costs of annotation [56, 89, 88]. Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\text{student}|\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.

Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\\text{student}|\\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior\"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.

Let's work together to brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.
","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**

How can we develop a more effective Teacher-Student architecture for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) that addresses the challenges of learning gaps, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has significant implications for the research community. A more effective Teacher-Student architecture for SSL could lead to improved performance in various applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, and recommender systems. This, in turn, could advance knowledge and lead to practical applications in areas like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and education. Furthermore, addressing the challenges of Teacher-Student architectures could pave the way for more effective transfer learning and few-shot learning methods.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Solving this problem is challenging because it involves addressing multiple issues simultaneously, including learning gaps, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they do not account for the complexities of these issues. For example, simply increasing the number of training iterations or using more complex models may not be sufficient to address the learning gap. Additionally, the discrepancies in features between the teacher and student models can make it difficult to optimize the consistency loss. Furthermore, the attention inconsistency issue can lead to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has not fully addressed the challenges of Teacher-Student architectures for SSL because it has focused on adapting closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success, but the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges. Recent approaches, such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), have attempted to address these challenges, but they have not fully resolved the issues of learning gaps, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency. Our approach differs from prior work by focusing on developing a more effective Teacher-Student architecture that addresses these challenges.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a new Teacher-Student architecture that incorporates the following key components:

* A more effective teacher model that can provide accurate and consistent instructions to the student model
* A student model that can learn from the teacher model and adapt to new classes and features
* A consistency loss function that can optimize the alignment between the teacher and student models
* A dataset that includes a mix of old and new classes, as well as weakly and strongly augmented data
* Metrics that can evaluate the performance of the Teacher-Student architecture, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

We expect the results of our approach to be a more effective Teacher-Student architecture for SSL that can address the challenges of learning gaps, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency. This, in turn, could lead to improved performance in various applications and advance knowledge in the field of SSL.",-1,-1,-1

Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\\text{student}|\\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior\"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.

How can we develop an effective semi-supervised learning method that addresses the challenges of teacher-student architectures in open-world environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear, and the teacher's supervision is incomplete and evolving?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of semi-supervised learning, as it can enable models to adapt to new information and evolve continually in real-world applications. This can lead to significant improvements in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and materials science. By developing an effective semi-supervised learning method, we can reduce the need for labeled data, improve model generalization, and enhance the overall performance of machine learning models.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The problem is challenging due to the following reasons:

* The teacher-student architecture is inherently asymmetric, with the teacher having robust prior knowledge and providing a stable learning signal, while the student's knowledge is incomplete and evolving.
* The learning gap between the teacher and student can lead to unsynchronized learning and significant discrepancies in representations, especially for new classes.
* The teacher's fast pace can cause large discrepancies in features between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), making consistency loss optimization difficult.
* Inadequate supervision for new classes can lead to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on closed-world assumptions, where the teacher has supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students. However, this assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where new classes may appear. Existing methods have also relied on naive or straightforward approaches, such as simply applying teacher-student architectures to open-world environments, which can lead to poor performance.

Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel semi-supervised learning method that addresses the challenges of teacher-student architectures in open-world environments. We will develop a method that can adapt to new information and evolve continually, reducing the need for labeled data and improving model generalization.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology will consist of the following key components:

* A novel semi-supervised learning method that addresses the challenges of teacher-student architectures in open-world environments.
* A master-teacher-student model framework that provides multi-layer guidance during the model evolution process.
* A teacher model that is constructed by performing an exponential moving average of the student models obtained from past training steps.
* A student model that is trained using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data, with the teacher model providing guidance and supervision.
* A dataset that consists of a large number of unlabeled samples, with a small number of labeled samples available for training.
* Evaluation metrics that include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as metrics that measure the model's ability to adapt to new information and evolve continually.

We expect our method to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various semi-supervised learning benchmarks, and to demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in terms of adaptability and generalization.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Teacher-Student architecture has proved its effectiveness in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) [65, 32, 52], which aims to take advantage of a large collection of unlabeled data, reducing the expensive costs of annotation [56, 89, 88]. Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\text{student}|\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.   Figure 1: Left: Learning effects of traditional Teacher-Student Consistency Model (TSCM, e.g., SimGCD [74]) and our Flipped Classroom Consistency Model (FlipClass) on Stanford Cars [33]. Middle: Model comparison between TSCM and our FlipClass, where 𝔻newsuperscript𝔻new\mathbb{D}^{\text{new}}blackboard_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT new end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT refers to data belonging to new classes. Right: Illustration of the inner feedback mechanism in FlipClass, where teacher attention is adapted to the student, leading to the alignment of attention.   To sum up, the challenges of previous teacher-student models arise from inadequate supervision on new classes and the gap between weakly and strongly augmented data. This results in attention inconsistency (Chall. III), which leads to discrepancies in predictions and representations (Chall. II), ultimately

Previous approaches tend to model p⁢(student|teacher)𝑝conditionalstudentteacherp(\\text{student}|\\text{teacher})italic_p ( student | teacher ), where the teacher typically acts as a fixed point of reference, providing a form of “supervision prior\"" to guide the student [25, 41, 59]. This supervision comes from labeled data and is asymmetrical: while the teacher has robust prior knowledge and provides a stable learning signal, the student’s knowledge is incomplete and evolving. The student learns from both the teacher’s supervision and the data it is exposed to, trying to emulate the teacher by aligning its predictions with those of the teacher.   Teacher-Student designs traditionally rely on a closed-world assumption, where it is expected that the teachers have supervision prior to all classes they will face while instructing students [60, 3]. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where instances belonging to new classes may appear [83, 30, 31, 40]. In such cases, discovering novelties could enable models to adapt new information and evolve continually as biological systems do [14, 48, 39]. Recently, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [68] stands out by challenging models to categorize unlabeled data containing both old and new classes using only partial labels for training. Although recent GCD methods have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success [74, 49], the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges.   Challenge I: Learning gap. Fig. 1 top left illustrates the learning evolution of student and teacher. The previous teacher-student models result in unsynchronized learning and a significant learning gap in new classes. The ideal learning dynamic between the teacher and student should be cohesive, which requires teaching students in accordance with their aptitude.   Challenge II: Discrepancies in features. The learning gap arises from the teacher’s fast pace, leading to large discrepancies in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes (Fig. 1 middle). This causes significant prediction differences, making consistency loss optimization difficult and hindering effective student learning. Over time, the iterative learning process exacerbates this misalignment.   Challenge III: Attention inconsistency. Inadequate supervision for new classes leads to inaccurate instructions from the teacher, causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher (Fig. 1 right). Imagine a classroom transitioning to a new subject. Without proper guidance, students’ attention diverges from the teacher’s, resulting in confusion and ineffective learning.

From agent2 to agent3: Hello agent3, I'd like to discuss a research task related to Teacher-Student architecture in Semi-Supervised Learning. The task involves analyzing the introduction to a research paper, conducting a literature review, brainstorming potential research ideas, summarizing collective ideas, and formulating a new research proposal in the format of the '5q'. I need assistance with understanding the current state of research in this area, identifying gaps in the introduction, and developing a new research idea that addresses these gaps. Can you help me with this task?
From agent3 to agent2: Hello agent2, I'd be happy to help you with your research task related to Teacher-Student architecture in Semi-Supervised Learning. To begin, let's analyze the introduction to the research paper and conduct a literature review to understand the current state of research in this area. The introduction highlights the challenges of traditional Teacher-Student models, including the learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency. Recent approaches, such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success, but the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges. To identify gaps in the introduction, we can explore the limitations of existing GCD methods and the potential for novel architectures or techniques to address these challenges. Shall we proceed with brainstorming potential research ideas and summarizing our collective thoughts?
From agent2 to agent3: Yes, let's proceed with brainstorming potential research ideas and summarizing our collective thoughts. Based on the introduction, it seems that one potential gap in existing GCD methods is the inability to effectively handle the learning gap and discrepancies in features between the teacher and student models. Perhaps we could explore novel architectures or techniques that can adapt to the evolving knowledge of the student model and reduce the discrepancies in features. What are your thoughts on this?
From agent3 to agent2: I completely agree with your assessment of the introduction and the potential gaps in existing GCD methods. The learning gap and discrepancies in features between the teacher and student models are significant challenges that need to be addressed.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can Teacher-Student architectures be adapted to effectively learn in dynamic and open environments, where new classes may appear, addressing the challenges of learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has the potential to advance the field of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and enable the development of more robust and adaptable machine learning models. This can lead to practical applications in real-world scenarios where new classes or data may appear, such as in image classification, object detection, or natural language processing. By addressing the challenges of learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency, researchers can develop more effective and efficient SSL models that can learn from limited labeled data and adapt to new information. This can have broader implications for the research community, as it can lead to the development of more accurate and reliable machine learning models that can be applied in a variety of domains.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
This problem is hard because it requires addressing the challenges of learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency in Teacher-Student architectures. The learning gap arises from the unsynchronized learning between the teacher and student, resulting in a significant learning gap in new classes. Discrepancies in features occur due to the large differences in representations between weakly-augmented data (teacher) and strongly-augmented data (student), especially for new classes. Attention inconsistency is caused by inadequate supervision for new classes, leading to inaccurate instructions from the teacher and causing the student to focus on different parts than the teacher. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they do not account for the complexities of dynamic and open environments, where new classes may appear. Technical obstacles include developing methods to reduce the learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency, while theoretical obstacles include understanding the underlying mechanisms of Teacher-Student architectures and their limitations in dynamic and open environments.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
This problem hasn't been solved before because previous research has focused on closed-world assumptions, where the teacher has prior knowledge of all classes. However, real-world applications often involve dynamic and open environments, where new classes may appear, posing new challenges. Existing solutions, such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), have adapted closed-world Teacher-Student strategies with notable success, but the transition is not seamless and presents several challenges. The lack of effective methods to address the learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency has prevented the development of robust and adaptable Teacher-Student architectures for dynamic and open environments. Our approach differs from prior work by focusing on developing novel methods to address these challenges and adapting Teacher-Student architectures to dynamic and open environments.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves developing a dynamic Teacher-Student framework that can adapt to the evolving knowledge of the student model and reduce the discrepancies in features, attention inconsistency, and learning gap. We plan to use a combination of reinforcement learning and meta-learning techniques to optimize the teaching process and develop attention mechanisms to align the teacher's and student's focus on new classes. We will evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets, such as Stanford Cars, and metrics, such as accuracy and F1-score. The expected outcomes include the development of a robust and adaptable Teacher-Student architecture that can effectively learn in dynamic and open environments, addressing the challenges of learning gap, discrepancies in features, and attention inconsistency. We anticipate that our approach will lead to significant advancements in the field of SSL and enable the development of more accurate and reliable machine learning models that can be applied in a variety of domains.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  The effectiveness of Bayesian neural networks relies heavily on the quality of posterior distribution estimation. However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). This connection between the geometry of energy landscape and generalization has spurred many works in optimization, ranging from theoretical understanding (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Dinh et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019a) to new optimization algorithms (Mobahi, 2016; Izmailov et al., 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020).   However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks. This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). It can further be rationalized from a Bayesian marginalization perspective: within the flat basin, each model configuration occupies a substantial volume and contributes significantly to a more precise estimation of the predictive distribution (Bishop, 2006). Moreover, existing flatness-aware methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020), ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models. Therefore, Bayesian marginalization can potentially offer significant improvements over flatness-aware optimization by sampling from the flat basins (Wilson, 2020; Huang et al., 2020).   Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Even for single point estimation, explicitly biasing toward the flat basins will introduce substantial computational overhead, inducing nested loops (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018), doubled gradients calculation (Foret et al., 2020; Möllenhoff & Khan, 2022) or min-max problems (Foret et al., 2020). The efficiency problem needs to be addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep neural networks.   In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to explicitly prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT into the Markov chain to pull model parameters 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ toward flat basins at each updating step (Fig. 1a). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution which eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy (Baldassi et al., 2016) (Fig. 1b). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can also be viewed as being achieved by Gaussian convolution, a common technique in diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019). Our method enjoys a simple joint distribution of 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ and 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and the computational overhead

Solving this problem can lead to improved generalization performance in Bayesian neural networks and advance knowledge in optimization algorithms for deep learning. It could also have practical applications in various fields where accurate estimation of the predictive distribution is crucial.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
The challenge lies in addressing the computational overhead introduced by explicitly biasing toward flat basins during posterior inference. Naive approaches may struggle with nested loops, doubled gradients calculation, or min-max problems, making it difficult to efficiently prioritize flat modes.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has not fully addressed the prioritization of flat basins in Bayesian neural networks during posterior inference. Existing methods are not always aware of the flatness in the energy landscape, leading to limitations in generalization performance. This approach differs by explicitly introducing an auxiliary guiding variable to pull model parameters toward flat basins.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
The proposed methodology involves introducing an auxiliary guiding variable sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution to prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape. The method aims to simplify the joint distribution of model parameters and the guiding variable, reducing computational overhead. The expected outcome is an efficient sampling algorithm that can improve generalization performance in deep neural networks by focusing on flat modes.",-1,-1,-1

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  The effectiveness of Bayesian neural networks relies heavily on the quality of posterior distribution estimation. However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). This connection between the geometry of energy landscape and generalization has spurred many works in optimization, ranging from theoretical understanding (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Dinh et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019a) to new optimization algorithms (Mobahi, 2016; Izmailov et al., 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020).   However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks. This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). It can further be rationalized from a Bayesian marginalization perspective: within the flat basin, each model configuration occupies a substantial volume and contributes significantly to a more precise estimation of the predictive distribution (Bishop, 2006). Moreover, existing flatness-aware methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020), ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models. Therefore, Bayesian marginalization can potentially offer significant improvements over flatness-aware optimization by sampling from the flat basins (Wilson, 2020; Huang et al., 2020).   Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Even for single point estimation, explicitly biasing toward the flat basins will introduce substantial computational overhead, inducing nested loops (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018), doubled gradients calculation (Foret et al., 2020; Möllenhoff & Khan, 2022) or min-max problems (Foret et al., 2020). The efficiency problem needs to be addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep neural networks.   In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to explicitly prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT into the Markov chain to pull model parameters 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ toward flat basins at each updating step (Fig. 1a). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution which eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy (Baldassi et al., 2016) (Fig. 1b). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can also be viewed as being achieved by Gaussian convolution, a common technique in diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019). Our method enjoys a simple joint distribution of 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ and 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and the computational overhead

How can we efficiently prioritize the capture of flat modes in the posterior distribution during Bayesian inference for neural networks to improve generalization performance?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Addressing this problem is crucial because flat modes in the energy landscape of Bayesian neural networks are associated with better generalization and robustness. By improving the estimation of the posterior distribution to focus on these flat modes, we can enhance the predictive performance of Bayesian models, which is particularly important in real-world applications where model reliability is paramount. This research could lead to new methodologies that not only advance theoretical understanding but also provide practical tools for practitioners in machine learning, potentially influencing future research directions in Bayesian inference and deep learning.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenge lies in the high-dimensional and multi-modal nature of the posterior distribution, which makes it difficult to accurately sample from flat modes without incurring significant computational overhead. Existing methods often fail to distinguish between flat and sharp modes, leading to suboptimal generalization. Additionally, introducing bias towards flat basins can complicate the inference process, requiring advanced techniques to manage increased computational demands, such as nested loops or double gradient calculations.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has largely overlooked the importance of flatness in the posterior distribution during inference, focusing instead on energy-oriented strategies that do not differentiate between modes. Existing flatness-aware methods typically rely on single-point estimations, which do not capture the diversity of high-performing models within flat basins. This gap in understanding and methodology has hindered progress in effectively leveraging flat modes for improved generalization.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing an efficient sampling algorithm that incorporates an auxiliary guiding variable to steer model parameters towards flat basins during the Markov chain updating process. This variable will be sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution that emphasizes flat modes, potentially using techniques like Gaussian convolution. We will evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets, measuring improvements in generalization performance through metrics such as accuracy and robustness. The expected outcome is a more effective Bayesian inference method that significantly enhances the generalization capabilities of neural networks by prioritizing flat modes in the posterior distribution.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  The effectiveness of Bayesian neural networks relies heavily on the quality of posterior distribution estimation. However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). This connection between the geometry of energy landscape and generalization has spurred many works in optimization, ranging from theoretical understanding (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Dinh et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019a) to new optimization algorithms (Mobahi, 2016; Izmailov et al., 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020).   However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks. This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). It can further be rationalized from a Bayesian marginalization perspective: within the flat basin, each model configuration occupies a substantial volume and contributes significantly to a more precise estimation of the predictive distribution (Bishop, 2006). Moreover, existing flatness-aware methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020), ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models. Therefore, Bayesian marginalization can potentially offer significant improvements over flatness-aware optimization by sampling from the flat basins (Wilson, 2020; Huang et al., 2020).   Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Even for single point estimation, explicitly biasing toward the flat basins will introduce substantial computational overhead, inducing nested loops (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018), doubled gradients calculation (Foret et al., 2020; Möllenhoff & Khan, 2022) or min-max problems (Foret et al., 2020). The efficiency problem needs to be addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep neural networks.   In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to explicitly prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT into the Markov chain to pull model parameters 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ toward flat basins at each updating step (Fig. 1a). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution which eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy (Baldassi et al., 2016) (Fig. 1b). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can also be viewed as being achieved by Gaussian convolution, a common technique in diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019). Our method enjoys a simple joint distribution of 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ and 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and the computational overhead

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**

How can we develop an efficient and effective method for prioritizing flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem can lead to improved generalization performance and robustness in deep neural networks. It can also advance our understanding of the connection between the geometry of the energy landscape and generalization. This research has the potential to impact future research in the field of deep learning, particularly in the development of more efficient and effective optimization algorithms. By prioritizing flat basins, we can improve the overall performance of deep neural networks, leading to practical applications in areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Existing methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin, ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models. This makes it difficult to develop an efficient and effective method for prioritizing flat basins, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying geometry of the energy landscape and the ability to sample from the flat basin in a way that captures the diversity of high-performing models.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing methods for sampling from flat basins, but these methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin. This approach ignores the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models, which can lead to suboptimal performance. Additionally, existing methods often require significant computational resources and may not be scalable to large datasets. Our approach differs from prior work by prioritizing the capture of flat basins in the energy landscape, which can lead to improved generalization performance and robustness in deep neural networks.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a new optimization algorithm that prioritizes flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks. We will use a combination of Bayesian marginalization and Gaussian convolution to sample from the flat basin and capture the diversity of high-performing models. We will evaluate our approach using a range of datasets and metrics, including accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. We expect our approach to lead to improved generalization performance and robustness in deep neural networks, as well as a deeper understanding of the connection between the geometry of the energy landscape and generalization.",-1,-1,-1

However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly.

This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022).

Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Even for single point estimation, explicitly biasing toward the flat basins will introduce substantial computational overhead, inducing nested loops (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018), doubled gradients calculation (Foret et al., 2020; Möllenhoff & Khan, 2022) or min-max problems (Foret et al., 2020). The efficiency problem needs to be addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep neural networks.   In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to explicitly prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT into the Markov chain to pull model parameters 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ toward flat basins at each updating step (Fig. 1a). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution which eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy (Baldassi et al., 2016) (Fig. 1b). 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can also be viewed as being achieved by Gaussian convolution, a common technique in diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019). Our method enjoys a simple joint distribution of 𝜽𝜽\bm{\theta}bold_italic_θ and 𝜽asubscript𝜽𝑎\bm{\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and the computational overhead

However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). This connection between the geometry of energy landscape and generalization has spurred many works in optimization, ranging from theoretical understanding (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Dinh et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019a) to new optimization algorithms (Mobahi, 2016; Izmailov et al., 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020).   However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks. This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). It can further be rationalized from a Bayesian marginalization perspective: within the flat basin, each model configuration occupies a substantial volume and contributes significantly to a more precise estimation of the predictive distribution (Bishop, 2006).

How can we efficiently prioritize flat modes in the energy landscape of deep neural networks during posterior inference to improve generalization performance?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of Bayesian deep learning, as it can lead to improved generalization performance and more accurate uncertainty estimation. By prioritizing flat modes, we can develop more robust and reliable models that can handle complex tasks and datasets. This research can also have broader implications for the development of more efficient and effective Bayesian inference methods, which can be applied to a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Prioritizing flat modes in the energy landscape of deep neural networks is challenging due to the high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature of the posterior distribution. Naive approaches, such as explicit biasing towards flat modes, can introduce substantial computational overhead and may not be effective in practice. Additionally, existing flatness-aware methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin, ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models. Overcoming these challenges requires the development of efficient and effective methods that can accurately capture the flat modes in the posterior distribution.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing flatness-aware optimization methods, but these methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin, which can be limiting. Additionally, existing Bayesian inference methods are often not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference, which can lead to poor generalization performance. Our approach differs from prior work by introducing an auxiliary guiding variable to pull model parameters towards flat basins at each updating step, which can efficiently capture the flat modes in the posterior distribution.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves introducing an auxiliary guiding variable into the Markov chain to pull model parameters towards flat basins at each updating step. The guiding variable is sampled from a smoothed posterior distribution that eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy. We will evaluate our method using a range of benchmark datasets, including image classification and regression tasks, and compare its performance to existing Bayesian inference methods. We expect our method to achieve improved generalization performance and more accurate uncertainty estimation compared to existing methods.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  The effectiveness of Bayesian neural networks relies heavily on the quality of posterior distribution estimation. However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022).

However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks. This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022).

The efficiency problem needs to be addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep neural networks.   In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to explicitly prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural networks.

However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). This connection between the geometry of energy landscape and generalization has spurred many works in optimization, ranging from theoretical understanding (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Dinh et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018; Jiang et al., 2019a) to new optimization algorithms (Mobahi, 2016; Izmailov et al., 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020).   However, most of the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance, particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks. This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). It can further be rationalized from a Bayesian marginalization perspective: within the flat basin, each model configuration occupies a substantial volume and contributes significantly to a more precise estimation of the predictive distribution (Bishop, 2006). Moreover, existing flatness-aware methods often rely on a single solution to represent the entire flat basin (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020), ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models. Therefore, Bayesian marginalization can potentially offer significant improvements over flatness-aware optimization by sampling from the flat basins (Wilson, 2020; Huang et al., 2020).   Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Even for single point estimation, explicitly biasing toward the flat basins will introduce substantial computational overhead, inducing nested loops (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018), doubled gradients calculation (Foret et al., 2020; Möllenhoff & Khan, 2022) or min-max problems (Foret et al., 2020). The efficiency problem needs to be addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep neural networks.

","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can we develop an efficient sampling algorithm that prioritizes flat basins in the energy landscape of Bayesian neural networks while minimizing computational overhead?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem can lead to improved generalization performance in Bayesian neural networks, which is crucial for many real-world applications. By prioritizing flat modes, we can develop more robust and accurate models that can generalize well to new, unseen data. This can advance our understanding of the connection between the geometry of the energy landscape and generalization, and can lead to practical applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making under uncertainty.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
The problem is challenging because existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape during posterior inference, which can introduce substantial computational overhead. Naive approaches may fail due to the high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature of the posterior distribution. Explicitly biasing toward flat basins can be difficult, and requires careful consideration of the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Additionally, the introduction of auxiliary guiding variables and Bayesian marginalization adds complexity to the problem, requiring careful design and implementation of the sampling algorithm.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on energy-oriented inference strategies that cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes. The introduction of auxiliary guiding variables and Bayesian marginalization offers a new perspective on this problem, which can potentially overcome the limitations of existing methods. However, previous work has not fully explored the potential of these techniques for prioritizing flat basins, and has not addressed the computational overhead issue. Our approach differs from prior work by incorporating auxiliary guiding variables and Bayesian marginalization, and by developing an efficient sampling algorithm that prioritizes flat basins while minimizing computational overhead.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
The proposed methodology involves developing an efficient sampling algorithm that incorporates auxiliary guiding variables to prioritize flat basins. The algorithm will be based on a smoothed posterior distribution that eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy. We will use a combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the parameters of the model. The expected outcomes include improved generalization performance, increased robustness to overfitting, and reduced computational overhead. We will evaluate our approach using a range of benchmark datasets and metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results will be compared to existing state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Increased scale is one of the key factors boosting performance in deep learning [1, 2, 3]. However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.   Figure 1:  (a) Our MoE Jetpack converts pre-trained dense models into MoE models, enhancing convergence and performance while maintaining equivalent FLOPs. Here, Exp. represents individual experts, E𝐸Eitalic_E denotes the number of experts, and L𝐿Litalic_L indicates the total number of layers. (b) Performance comparison of ViT trained from scratch, pre-trained ViT, Soft MoE [6] trained from scratch, and MoE Jetpack across various datasets. MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance. Existing MoE architectures, such as Switch Transformers [4] and Soft MoE [6], are not designed to leverage pre-existing dense checkpoints, which may lead to optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning.

However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.   Figure 1:  (a) Our MoE Jetpack converts pre-trained dense models into MoE models, enhancing convergence and performance while maintaining equivalent FLOPs.

MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance.

MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance. Existing MoE architectures, such as Switch Transformers [4] and Soft MoE [6], are not designed to leverage pre-existing dense checkpoints, which may lead to optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning. The SpheroMoE layer mitigates these challenges by normalized token mixing, expert regularization, and adaptive dual-path.

However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Increased scale is one of the key factors boosting performance in deep learning [1, 2, 3]. However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.   Figure 1:  (a) Our MoE Jetpack converts pre-trained dense models into MoE models, enhancing convergence and performance while maintaining equivalent FLOPs. Here, Exp. represents individual experts, E𝐸Eitalic_E denotes the number of experts, and L𝐿Litalic_L indicates the total number of layers. (b) Performance comparison of ViT trained from scratch, pre-trained ViT, Soft MoE [6] trained from scratch, and MoE Jetpack across various datasets. MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance. Existing MoE architectures, such as Switch Transformers [4] and Soft MoE [6], are not designed to leverage pre-existing dense checkpoints, which may lead to optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning. The SpheroMoE layer mitigates these challenges by normalized token mixing, expert regularization, and adaptive dual-path.   By equipping dense checkpoints with

Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights.

How can we effectively leverage pre-trained dense model checkpoints to enhance the training efficiency and performance of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial as it addresses the significant barrier to the adoption of MoE models, which is their high training cost and the lack of pre-trained models. By utilizing dense checkpoints, we can potentially reduce the computational resources and time required for training MoE models, making them more accessible for researchers and practitioners. This advancement could lead to improved model performance in various applications, such as natural language processing and computer vision, and stimulate further research into hybrid model architectures that combine the strengths of dense and sparse models.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenge lies in the inherent differences between dense and sparse model architectures, particularly in how they utilize parameters and process inputs. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the unique characteristics of MoE models, such as the need for dynamic expert selection and the risk of overfitting during fine-tuning. Additionally, technical obstacles include the complexity of integrating dense checkpoints into MoE architectures without losing the benefits of sparsity, as well as ensuring that the resulting models maintain high accuracy and efficiency.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on either dense models or MoE models in isolation, with limited exploration of their integration. The lack of pre-trained MoE models and the computational demands of training them from scratch have restricted research efforts. Existing solutions often overlook the potential of checkpoint recycling and adaptive architectures that can facilitate the transition from dense to sparse models. Our approach aims to fill this gap by introducing novel techniques that specifically address the challenges of fine-tuning MoE models using dense checkpoints.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves two key components: (1) **Checkpoint Recycling**, which repurposes dense model weights to initialize MoE models, thereby accelerating convergence and improving accuracy; and (2) **Hyperspherical Adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) Layer**, which optimizes the MoE architecture for better integration of dense checkpoints. We plan to evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets across various tasks, measuring metrics such as convergence speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in the performance of MoE models fine-tuned from dense checkpoints, demonstrating the viability of this hybrid approach in practical applications.",-1,-1,-1

However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.

MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods.

However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.

What are the key challenges and limitations in fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and how can we leverage pre-trained knowledge to enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has significant implications for the research community and practical applications. By leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints, we can reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models, making them more accessible and efficient. This can lead to advancements in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Moreover, this research can pave the way for more efficient and scalable MoE models, which can be applied to real-world problems, such as image classification, object detection, and language translation.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

This problem is challenging because it requires addressing several technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles. Firstly, MoE models are inherently complex and require careful design and optimization to achieve good performance. Secondly, fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models is a non-trivial task that requires developing new techniques and strategies to leverage the pre-trained knowledge. Additionally, the lack of pre-trained MoE models and the need for extensive data and computational resources make it difficult to train and evaluate MoE models. Furthermore, the optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning can lead to suboptimal performance and convergence issues.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has not fully addressed this problem because of several gaps and limitations. Firstly, existing MoE architectures, such as Switch Transformers and Soft MoE, are not designed to leverage pre-existing dense checkpoints, which may lead to optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning. Secondly, the lack of pre-trained MoE models and the need for extensive data and computational resources have restricted MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Finally, the absence of effective techniques and strategies for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models has hindered progress in this area.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed approach, MoE Jetpack, consists of two key techniques: checkpoint recycling and the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer. Checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods to provide greater flexibility and superior MoE initialization weights. The SpheroMoE layer presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance. We will evaluate MoE Jetpack on various datasets and metrics, including accuracy, convergence speed, and computational efficiency.

However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.

As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints.

How can we effectively leverage pre-trained dense checkpoints to improve the performance and convergence speed of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while addressing the challenges of training MoE models from scratch and the lack of pre-trained MoE models?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of deep learning, as MoE models have shown great potential in scaling up model capacity without significantly increasing computational costs. By leveraging pre-trained dense checkpoints, we can accelerate the development of MoE models and make them more accessible to researchers and practitioners. This can lead to breakthroughs in various applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Furthermore, this research can also contribute to the development of more efficient and effective methods for fine-tuning pre-trained models, which is a critical aspect of deep learning research.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The problem is challenging because MoE models require a large amount of data and computational resources to train from scratch, and the lack of pre-trained MoE models makes it difficult to leverage the knowledge from pre-trained dense checkpoints. Additionally, MoE models have a complex architecture that involves multiple experts and a routing mechanism, which makes it difficult to design an effective method for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints. Naive approaches, such as simply using the pre-trained dense checkpoints as initialization for the MoE model, may not work well due to the differences in architecture and the need for specialized experts. Therefore, a more sophisticated approach is needed to address these challenges.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has focused on developing MoE models from scratch, and there is a lack of research on leveraging pre-trained dense checkpoints for MoE models. Existing methods for fine-tuning pre-trained models are not directly applicable to MoE models due to their unique architecture. Additionally, the complexity of MoE models and the need for specialized experts make it difficult to design an effective method for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel method for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models, which addresses the challenges of MoE models and leverages the knowledge from pre-trained dense checkpoints.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves two key techniques: checkpoint recycling and hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer.

            Dear Research Team,

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Increased scale is one of the key factors boosting performance in deep learning [1, 2, 3]. However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.   Figure 1:  (a) Our MoE Jetpack converts pre-trained dense models into MoE models, enhancing convergence and performance while maintaining equivalent FLOPs. Here, Exp. represents individual experts, E𝐸Eitalic_E denotes the number of experts, and L𝐿Litalic_L indicates the total number of layers. (b) Performance comparison of ViT trained from scratch, pre-trained ViT, Soft MoE [6] trained from scratch, and MoE Jetpack across various datasets. MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance. Existing MoE architectures, such as Switch Transformers [4] and Soft MoE [6], are not designed to leverage pre-existing dense checkpoints, which may lead to optimization and over-specialization challenges during fine-tuning. The SpheroMoE layer mitigates these challenges by normalized token mixing, expert regularization, and adaptive dual-path.   By equipping dense checkpoints with

However, as models expand in size, their computational demands surge, resulting in considerable slowdowns during both training and inference phases. A promising approach that decouples model size from computational costs is the sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) [4, 5, 6]. Unlike densely activated models (referred to as dense models hereafter) [7, 8] apply the full network parameters to all inputs, MoE dynamically activates different pieces of the model for distinct input tokens. This allows for model scaling without substantially increasing the FLOPs111FLOPs means the floating point operations per second. The vanilla design of MoE does not inherently provide runtime advantages and requires additional parallelization strategies [9, 10] for acceleration. In our implementation, we offer an effective matrix multiplication method for parallelization, detailed in Appendix C., thereby maintaining training and inference speeds during model upscaling. Recent advancements have seen successful implementations of MoE across various domains [11, 12, 13].   Despite their potential, MoE models face significant adoption challenges primarily due to the lack of pre-trained models. Unlike dense models, which benefit from a rich repository of pre-trained models accessible through communities like Hugging Face [14] (∼similar-to\\sim∼81k models) and Timm [15] (∼similar-to\\sim∼800 models), most MoE models must be trained from scratch using randomly initialized weights. The absence of pre-trained weights necessitates substantial GPU hours and extensive data for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, thereby restricting MoE research to a limited number of research teams. Consequently, our research aims to reduce the training time and data requirements for MoE models by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. We will specifically investigate whether utilizing dense checkpoints can enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models during fine-tuning.

MoE Jetpack shows significant performance improvements.    In this paper, we propose MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), MoE Jetpack leverages the sunk cost of dense pre-training to enhance MoE model performance and accelerate convergence. It comprises two key techniques. The first is checkpoint recycling, which initializes MoE models using dense checkpoints. Unlike sparse upcycling [16], which merely copies the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to construct experts, checkpoint recycling leverages various dense checkpoints and multiple weight selection methods. This approach provides greater flexibility and results in superior MoE initialization weights. The second technique is the hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which presents an optimized MoE architecture for seamless integration of dense checkpoints and enhanced fine-tuning performance.

From agent1 to agent3: Hello, I am agent1. I would like to collaborate with you to generate a new research idea based on the given introduction about sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) models. Can you please help me analyze the introduction and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area?
From agent3 to agent1: Hello agent1, I'd be happy to help you analyze the introduction and conduct a brief literature review on sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) models. The introduction highlights the potential of MoE models in reducing computational costs while maintaining performance, but also notes the challenges of training these models from scratch due to the lack of pre-trained models. Recent research has focused on developing methods to leverage pre-trained dense models for MoE, such as the proposed MoE Jetpack approach. To build upon this, we could explore ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MoE models, such as developing new architectures or training methods that can better utilize pre-trained knowledge.
From agent1 to agent3: Thank you for the analysis and literature review. I agree that exploring ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MoE models is a promising direction. Let's brainstorm some potential research ideas that build upon the MoE Jetpack approach. What are your thoughts on developing new architectures or training methods that can better utilize pre-trained knowledge?
From agent3 to agent1: One potential research idea is to develop a new architecture that incorporates a hierarchical mixture of experts, where each expert is specialized in a specific task or domain. This could allow for more efficient utilization of pre-trained knowledge and improved performance on multi-task learning scenarios. Another idea is to explore the use of meta-learning techniques to train MoE models, which could enable the models to adapt more quickly to new tasks and domains. We could also investigate the use of knowledge distillation methods to transfer knowledge from pre-trained dense models to MoE models, which could help to improve the performance of MoE models while reducing the need for extensive training data. Additionally, we could consider developing new training methods that incorporate reinforcement learning or self-supervised learning techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MoE models. What are your thoughts on these ideas, and do you have any other suggestions for how we could improve the MoE Jetpack approach?
From agent1 to agent3: I think developing a new architecture that incorporates a hierarchical mixture of experts is a great idea. This could allow for more efficient utilization of pre-trained knowledge and improved performance on multi-task learning scenarios. I also like the idea of exploring meta-learning techniques to train MoE models, as this could enable the models to adapt more quickly to new tasks and domains. Additionally, investigating knowledge distillation methods to transfer knowledge from pre-trained dense models to MoE models could help improve the performance of MoE models while reducing the need for extensive training data. To further improve the MoE Jetpack approach, we could consider developing new training methods that incorporate reinforcement learning or self-supervised learning techniques. Let's summarize our collective ideas and formulate a new research proposal in the format of the '5q'.

From agent2 to agent3: Hello, I am agent2 and I need help with a research task. Can you collaborate with me to generate a new research idea based on the given introduction about sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) models?
From agent3 to agent2: Hello agent2, I'd be happy to help you generate a new research idea based on the introduction about sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) models. To get started, let's break down the introduction and identify the key points. The introduction discusses how MoE models can scale up without substantially increasing computational costs, but they face significant adoption challenges due to the lack of pre-trained models. It proposes MoE Jetpack, a new approach for fine-tuning pre-trained dense checkpoints into MoE models. What specific aspects of MoE models would you like to focus on for our research idea?
From agent2 to agent3: I would like to focus on the aspect of leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints to enhance the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models. Specifically, I am interested in exploring how to effectively utilize the pre-trained weights from dense models to initialize MoE models, and how to design efficient fine-tuning strategies to adapt the pre-trained knowledge to the MoE architecture.
From agent3 to agent2: That's a great direction to take our research idea. Leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints can significantly improve the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models. To effectively utilize the pre-trained weights from dense models to initialize MoE models, we could explore techniques such as weight sharing, weight masking, or knowledge distillation. For efficient fine-tuning strategies, we could investigate methods like transfer learning, meta-learning, or online learning. What are your thoughts on these approaches, and do you have any specific ideas for how to design the fine-tuning strategy?
From agent2 to agent3: I think weight sharing and knowledge distillation are promising techniques for initializing MoE models with pre-trained dense checkpoints. For fine-tuning strategies, I believe transfer learning and meta-learning could be effective approaches. However, I'd like to propose a new research idea that combines these techniques with a novel architecture. Let's design a framework that integrates weight sharing and knowledge distillation for MoE initialization, and then applies transfer learning and meta-learning for fine-tuning. We could also explore the use of attention mechanisms to adapt the pre-trained knowledge to the MoE architecture. What are your thoughts on this idea?
From agent3 to agent2: I think your proposed framework that integrates weight sharing and knowledge distillation for MoE initialization, and then applies transfer learning and meta-learning for fine-tuning, is a great direction to take our research idea. The use of attention mechanisms to adapt the pre-trained knowledge to the MoE architecture is also an interesting approach. To further develop this idea, let's consider the following: How can we effectively combine weight sharing and knowledge distillation to initialize MoE models? What specific transfer learning and meta-learning methods would be most suitable for fine-tuning the MoE models? And how can we design the attention mechanisms to efficiently adapt the pre-trained knowledge to the MoE architecture?
","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can we design an efficient and effective Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that leverages pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has the potential to significantly advance the field of MoE research, enabling the development of more efficient and effective models that can be applied to a wide range of tasks and domains. By leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints, MoE models can reduce the need for extensive training data and computational resources, making them more accessible and practical for real-world applications. This research can also lead to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-task learning, and can pave the way for the development of more sophisticated and specialized models that can tackle complex tasks and challenges.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
Solving this problem is challenging because it requires addressing several technical and theoretical obstacles. One of the main challenges is designing an effective mechanism for leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints, which can be difficult due to the differences in architecture and training objectives between dense and MoE models. Additionally, MoE models can suffer from issues such as overfitting, sparse data allocation, and expert specialization, which can negatively impact their performance and efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of pre-trained MoE models and the limited understanding of how to effectively fine-tune them can make it difficult to develop and evaluate new MoE architectures.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
This problem has not been fully solved before because previous research has focused primarily on developing new MoE architectures and training methods, rather than leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints. While some studies have explored the use of pre-trained models for MoE, these efforts have been limited and have not fully addressed the challenges and complexities involved in designing an efficient and effective MoE architecture that can leverage pre-trained knowledge. Additionally, the lack of pre-trained MoE models and the limited understanding of how to effectively fine-tune them have hindered progress in this area. Our approach differs from prior work in that it focuses on developing a novel MoE architecture that can effectively leverage pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints, and that addresses the challenges and complexities involved in designing and training such models.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our approach involves developing a novel MoE architecture that leverages pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of MoE models. The key components of our approach include: (1) a mechanism for initializing MoE models using pre-trained dense checkpoints, (2) a novel gating mechanism that enables the model to adaptively select and combine the outputs of multiple experts, and (3) a fine-tuning strategy that leverages the pre-trained knowledge to improve the performance and efficiency of the MoE model. We plan to evaluate our approach using a range of benchmarks and datasets, including natural language processing and computer vision tasks, and will measure the performance and efficiency of our model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and computational cost. We expect our approach to achieve state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained knowledge from dense checkpoints for MoE models.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Bayesian methods for neural network (NN) training aim to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and estimated posterior distributions. This is equivalent to minimizing the variational loss (or negative ELBO)    ℒ⁢(𝝍)=−𝔼𝜽∼q𝝍⁢[log⁡p⁢(𝒟|𝜽)]+D𝕂⁢𝕃⁢(q𝝍|p0)ℒ𝝍subscript𝔼similar-to𝜽subscript𝑞𝝍delimited-[]𝑝conditional𝒟𝜽subscript𝐷𝕂𝕃conditionalsubscript𝑞𝝍subscript𝑝0\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})=-\mathbb{E}_{{{\bm{\theta}}\sim q_{\bm{\psi}}}}\!\left[% {\log p(\mathcal{D}|{\bm{\theta}})}\right]+D_{\mathbb{KL}}\!\left({q_{\bm{\psi% }}}|{p_{0}}\right)caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) = - blackboard_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ ∼ italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ roman_log italic_p ( caligraphic_D | bold_italic_θ ) ] + italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT blackboard_K blackboard_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )  (1)   Here 𝜽𝜽{\bm{\theta}}bold_italic_θ are the network parameters, 𝝍𝝍\bm{\psi}bold_italic_ψ are the variational parameters of the approximate posterior q𝝍⁢(𝜽)subscript𝑞𝝍𝜽q_{\bm{\psi}}({\bm{\theta}})italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ), 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D is the training dataset, and p0⁢(𝜽)subscript𝑝0𝜽p_{0}({\bm{\theta}})italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ) is the prior. The two terms in the variational loss correspond to data fit and regularization to the prior, the latter being analogous to a regularizer r⁢(𝜽)=−log⁡p0⁢(𝜽)𝑟𝜽subscript𝑝0𝜽r({\bm{\theta}})=-\log p_{0}({\bm{\theta}})italic_r ( bold_italic_θ ) = - roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ) in traditional point estimation methods like SGD.   An important set of approaches learns the variational parameters by gradient descent on ℒ⁢(𝝍)ℒ𝝍\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) (Blundell et al., 2015). More recently Khan and colleagues (Khan et al., 2018b; Khan and Rue, 2023; Shen et al., 2024) have proposed using the natural gradient 𝐅𝝍−1⁢∇𝝍ℒ⁢(𝝍)superscriptsubscript𝐅𝝍1subscript∇𝝍ℒ𝝍\mathbf{F}_{\bm{\psi}}^{-1}\nabla_{\bm{\psi}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})bold_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) where 𝐅𝝍subscript𝐅𝝍\mathbf{F}_{\bm{\psi}}bold_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the Fisher information matrix of the variational family evaluated at q𝝍subscript𝑞𝝍q_{\bm{\psi}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Natural gradient descent (NGD) is often more efficient than vanilla GD because it accounts for the intrinsic geometry of the variational family (Amari, 1998).

My recent work critically examines the arguments surrounding the extension of contextuality, challenging the notion that certain principles are merely non-substantive. I have developed a framework that integrates probabilistic causal models to address inconsistencies in contextuality, leading to the concept of model-based contextuality (M-contextuality). This work not only clarifies the relationship between contextuality and direct influences but also provides a new interpretation of contextuality-by-default.\n\nIn addition to my theoretical pursuits, I have ventured into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning, proposing a synergy between analogical reasoning and reinforcement learning. This innovative approach highlights how relational similarities can enhance learning algorithms, supported by simulation results that demonstrate its efficacy.\n\nMy research also extends to practical applications, where I have developed robust non-zero priors for penalized regression models, inspired by human decision heuristics. This work has yielded interpretable solutions across various tasks, bridging the gap between complex models and simpler, more interpretable ones.\n\nFurthermore, I have investigated the training dynamics of neural networks in structured environments, revealing their capacity for anticipatory behavior when fine-tuned sequentially.

How can we improve the efficiency and accuracy of Bayesian neural network training in online learning scenarios, particularly in the presence of nonstationary data streams?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Improving Bayesian neural network training in online learning is crucial as it can lead to more robust models that adapt to changing data distributions in real-time applications, such as finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems. This research could pave the way for advancements in adaptive learning algorithms, enhancing their applicability in dynamic environments. By addressing this problem, we can contribute to the development of more reliable AI systems that can learn continuously and make informed decisions based on the most recent data.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

The challenges in this area include the computational complexity of updating the variational parameters in real-time, the need for effective regularization to prevent overfitting in nonstationary environments, and the difficulty in maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation in the learning process. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent instability of online learning, where the model must adapt quickly to new data while retaining knowledge from previous observations. Additionally, the need for efficient algorithms that can handle the dynamic nature of data streams adds to the complexity.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research has primarily focused on static datasets or has not adequately addressed the challenges posed by nonstationary data in online learning. Many existing methods do not scale well or are computationally expensive, making them impractical for real-time applications. Additionally, there has been a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate Bayesian methods with online learning strategies effectively. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by proposing a novel algorithm that leverages recent advancements in variational inference and online learning techniques.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed methodology involves developing a new Bayesian online learning algorithm that utilizes natural gradient descent for efficient parameter updates. We will employ a synthetic dataset that simulates nonstationary conditions to evaluate our approach. Key metrics for success will include the model's predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to changing data distributions. We expect our results to demonstrate significant improvements in both the speed of learning and the accuracy of predictions compared to traditional methods, ultimately leading to a more effective framework for Bayesian neural networks in online learning contexts.",-1,-1,-1

How can we efficiently update the variational parameters in online Bayesian neural network optimization to account for nonstationarity in the datastream?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is interesting and important because it can lead to significant improvements in online learning applications, such as real-time decision-making, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. By efficiently updating the variational parameters, we can reduce the computational cost and improve the statistical efficiency of online Bayesian neural network optimization. This can lead to better generalization performance, faster adaptation to changing data distributions, and improved robustness to nonstationarity. Furthermore, this research can have broader implications for the development of more efficient and effective online learning algorithms, which can be applied to a wide range of applications.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

This problem is challenging because it requires us to develop a new approach that can efficiently update the variational parameters in online Bayesian neural network optimization while accounting for nonstationarity in the datastream. This involves addressing several technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles, including:

* Developing a new update rule that can efficiently adapt to changing data distributions
* Addressing the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in online learning
* Handling the high-dimensional and non-stationary nature of the datastream
* Developing a scalable and computationally efficient algorithm that can handle large datasets and complex models

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research on online Bayesian neural network optimization has focused on developing algorithms that can efficiently update the variational parameters in a stationary data environment. However, these algorithms are not well-suited for nonstationary data environments, where the data distribution changes over time. Furthermore, existing solutions often rely on heuristics or approximations that can lead to suboptimal performance. Our approach differs from prior work by developing a new update rule that can efficiently adapt to changing data distributions, while also addressing the challenges of high-dimensional and non-stationary data.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our proposed approach involves developing a new update rule for online Bayesian neural network optimization that can efficiently adapt to changing data distributions. The key components of our approach include:

* A new update rule that combines the benefits of natural gradient descent and online learning
* A scalable and computationally efficient algorithm that can handle large datasets and complex models
* A method for handling high-dimensional and non-stationary data
* A set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of online learning applications

We expect our approach to lead to significant improvements in online learning applications, including faster adaptation to changing data distributions, better generalization performance, and improved robustness to nonstationarity.",-1,-1,-1

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Bayesian methods for neural network (NN) training aim to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and estimated posterior distributions. This is equivalent to minimizing the variational loss (or negative ELBO)    ℒ⁢(𝝍)=−𝔼𝜽∼q𝝍⁢[log⁡p⁢(𝒟|𝜽)]+D𝕂⁢𝕃⁢(q𝝍|p0)ℒ𝝍subscript𝔼similar-to𝜽subscript𝑞𝝍delimited-[]𝑝conditional𝒟𝜽subscript𝐷𝕂𝕃conditionalsubscript𝑞𝝍subscript𝑝0\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})=-\mathbb{E}_{{{\bm{\theta}}\sim q_{\bm{\psi}}}}\!\left[% {\log p(\mathcal{D}|{\bm{\theta}})}\right]+D_{\mathbb{KL}}\!\left({q_{\bm{\psi% }}}|{p_{0}}\right)caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) = - blackboard_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ ∼ italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ roman_log italic_p ( caligraphic_D | bold_italic_θ ) ] + italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT blackboard_K blackboard_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )  (1)   Here 𝜽𝜽{\bm{\theta}}bold_italic_θ are the network parameters, 𝝍𝝍\bm{\psi}bold_italic_ψ are the variational parameters of the approximate posterior q𝝍⁢(𝜽)subscript𝑞𝝍𝜽q_{\bm{\psi}}({\bm{\theta}})italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ), 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D is the training dataset, and p0⁢(𝜽)subscript𝑝0𝜽p_{0}({\bm{\theta}})italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ) is the prior. The two terms in the variational loss correspond to data fit and regularization to the prior, the latter being analogous to a regularizer r⁢(𝜽)=−log⁡p0⁢(𝜽)𝑟𝜽subscript𝑝0𝜽r({\bm{\theta}})=-\log p_{0}({\bm{\theta}})italic_r ( bold_italic_θ ) = - roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ) in traditional point estimation methods like SGD.   An important set of approaches learns the variational parameters by gradient descent on ℒ⁢(𝝍)ℒ𝝍\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) (Blundell et al., 2015). More recently Khan and colleagues (Khan et al., 2018b; Khan and Rue, 2023; Shen et al., 2024) have proposed using the natural gradient 𝐅𝝍−1⁢∇𝝍ℒ⁢(𝝍)superscriptsubscript𝐅𝝍1subscript∇𝝍ℒ𝝍\mathbf{F}_{\bm{\psi}}^{-1}\nabla_{\bm{\psi}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})bold_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) where 𝐅𝝍subscript𝐅𝝍\mathbf{F}_{\bm{\psi}}bold_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the Fisher information matrix of the variational family evaluated at q𝝍subscript𝑞𝝍q_{\bm{\psi}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Natural gradient descent (NGD) is often more efficient than vanilla GD because it accounts for the intrinsic geometry of the variational family (Amari, 1998). Khan and Rue (2023) call this approach the ""Bayesian Learning Rule"" or BLR. Using various choices for the variational distribution, generalized losses replacing negative log-likelihood, and other approximations, they reproduce many standard optimization methods such as Adam, and derive new ones.   We study Bayesian NN optimization in online learning, where the data are observed in sequence, 𝒟t={(𝒙k,𝒚k)k=1t}subscript𝒟𝑡superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑘subscript𝒚𝑘𝑘1𝑡\mathcal{D}_{t}=\{({\bm{x}}_{k},{\bm{y}}_{k})_{k=1}^{t}\}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { ( bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , bold_italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT }, and the algorithm maintains an approximate posterior q𝝍t⁢(𝜽t)≈p⁢(𝜽t|𝒟t)subscript𝑞subscript𝝍𝑡subscript𝜽𝑡𝑝conditionalsubscript𝜽𝑡subscript𝒟𝑡q_{\bm{\psi}_{t}}({\bm{\theta}}_{t})\approx p({\bm{\theta}}_{t}|\mathcal{D}_{t})italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ≈ italic_p ( bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), which it updates at each step.

How can we develop a Bayesian neural network that can efficiently learn from sequential data and adapt to non-stationarity in the data stream, while also providing accurate uncertainty estimates and robustness to out-of-distribution inputs?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**

Solving this problem is crucial for various applications, such as online learning, time-series forecasting, and decision-making under uncertainty. A Bayesian neural network that can adapt to non-stationarity and provide accurate uncertainty estimates can lead to more robust and reliable predictions, which can have significant impacts on fields such as finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Furthermore, this research can advance our understanding of Bayesian deep learning and its applications, and can lead to the development of more efficient and scalable algorithms for Bayesian neural networks.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**

Developing a Bayesian neural network that can adapt to non-stationarity and provide accurate uncertainty estimates is challenging due to several reasons. Firstly, Bayesian neural networks are computationally expensive and require significant computational resources, which can be a barrier for large-scale applications. Secondly, adapting to non-stationarity requires the model to be able to learn from sequential data and update its parameters accordingly, which can be challenging due to the complexity of the data and the need for online learning. Finally, providing accurate uncertainty estimates requires the model to be able to capture the uncertainty in the data and the model itself, which can be difficult due to the complexity of the model and the data.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**

Previous research on Bayesian neural networks has focused on developing algorithms for offline learning and has not addressed the challenge of adapting to non-stationarity in the data stream. Furthermore, existing methods for Bayesian neural networks are often computationally expensive and require significant computational resources, which can be a barrier for large-scale applications. Additionally, previous research has not fully addressed the challenge of providing accurate uncertainty estimates, which is crucial for many applications. Our approach differs from prior work by developing a Bayesian neural network that can adapt to non-stationarity and provide accurate uncertainty estimates, while also being computationally efficient and scalable.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**

Our approach involves developing a Bayesian neural network that uses a combination of variational inference and online learning to adapt to non-stationarity in the data stream. We propose a novel algorithm that uses a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix to reduce the computational complexity of the model, while also providing accurate uncertainty estimates. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to non-stationarity and providing accurate uncertainty estimates. Our results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for Bayesian neural networks in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, and can be applied to a wide range of applications.",-1,-1,-1

            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:

            **Introduction**

               1 Introduction  Bayesian methods for neural network (NN) training aim to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and estimated posterior distributions. This is equivalent to minimizing the variational loss (or negative ELBO)    ℒ⁢(𝝍)=−𝔼𝜽∼q𝝍⁢[log⁡p⁢(𝒟|𝜽)]+D𝕂⁢𝕃⁢(q𝝍|p0)ℒ𝝍subscript𝔼similar-to𝜽subscript𝑞𝝍delimited-[]𝑝conditional𝒟𝜽subscript𝐷𝕂𝕃conditionalsubscript𝑞𝝍subscript𝑝0\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})=-\mathbb{E}_{{{\bm{\theta}}\sim q_{\bm{\psi}}}}\!\left[% {\log p(\mathcal{D}|{\bm{\theta}})}\right]+D_{\mathbb{KL}}\!\left({q_{\bm{\psi% }}}|{p_{0}}\right)caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) = - blackboard_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ ∼ italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ roman_log italic_p ( caligraphic_D | bold_italic_θ ) ] + italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT blackboard_K blackboard_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )  (1)   Here 𝜽𝜽{\bm{\theta}}bold_italic_θ are the network parameters, 𝝍𝝍\bm{\psi}bold_italic_ψ are the variational parameters of the approximate posterior q𝝍⁢(𝜽)subscript𝑞𝝍𝜽q_{\bm{\psi}}({\bm{\theta}})italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ), 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D is the training dataset, and p0⁢(𝜽)subscript𝑝0𝜽p_{0}({\bm{\theta}})italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ) is the prior. The two terms in the variational loss correspond to data fit and regularization to the prior, the latter being analogous to a regularizer r⁢(𝜽)=−log⁡p0⁢(𝜽)𝑟𝜽subscript𝑝0𝜽r({\bm{\theta}})=-\log p_{0}({\bm{\theta}})italic_r ( bold_italic_θ ) = - roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ ) in traditional point estimation methods like SGD.   An important set of approaches learns the variational parameters by gradient descent on ℒ⁢(𝝍)ℒ𝝍\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) (Blundell et al., 2015). More recently Khan and colleagues (Khan et al., 2018b; Khan and Rue, 2023; Shen et al., 2024) have proposed using the natural gradient 𝐅𝝍−1⁢∇𝝍ℒ⁢(𝝍)superscriptsubscript𝐅𝝍1subscript∇𝝍ℒ𝝍\mathbf{F}_{\bm{\psi}}^{-1}\nabla_{\bm{\psi}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\psi})bold_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∇ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_L ( bold_italic_ψ ) where 𝐅𝝍subscript𝐅𝝍\mathbf{F}_{\bm{\psi}}bold_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the Fisher information matrix of the variational family evaluated at q𝝍subscript𝑞𝝍q_{\bm{\psi}}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Natural gradient descent (NGD) is often more efficient than vanilla GD because it accounts for the intrinsic geometry of the variational family (Amari, 1998). Khan and Rue (2023) call this approach the ""Bayesian Learning Rule"" or BLR. Using various choices for the variational distribution, generalized losses replacing negative log-likelihood, and other approximations, they reproduce many standard optimization methods such as Adam, and derive new ones.   We study Bayesian NN optimization in online learning, where the data are observed in sequence, 𝒟t={(𝒙k,𝒚k)k=1t}subscript𝒟𝑡superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑘subscript𝒚𝑘𝑘1𝑡\mathcal{D}_{t}=\{({\bm{x}}_{k},{\bm{y}}_{k})_{k=1}^{t}\}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { ( bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , bold_italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT }, and the algorithm maintains an approximate posterior q𝝍t⁢(𝜽t)≈p⁢(𝜽t|𝒟t)subscript𝑞subscript𝝍𝑡subscript𝜽𝑡𝑝conditionalsubscript𝜽𝑡subscript𝒟𝑡q_{\bm{\psi}_{t}}({\bm{\theta}}_{t})\approx p({\bm{\theta}}_{t}|\mathcal{D}_{t})italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ≈ italic_p ( bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), which it updates at each step. Fast updates (in terms of both computational speed and statistical efficiency) are critical for many online learning applications (Zhang et al., 2024). To allow for nonstationarity in the datastream, we include a time index on 𝜽tsubscript𝜽𝑡{\bm{\theta}}_{t}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, to represent that the parameters may change over time, as is standard for approaches based on state-space models and the extended Kalman filter (see e.g., (Sarkka and Svensson, 2023)).

From agent2 to agent1: Hello, I'd be happy to help you with a research idea based on the introduction provided. Can you please share the introduction with me?
From agent1 to agent2: The introduction is about Bayesian methods for neural network training, which aim to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and estimated posterior distributions. It discusses the variational loss, natural gradient descent, and online learning. I'd like to collaborate on a new research idea based on this introduction.
From agent2 to agent1: The introduction provides a solid foundation for exploring Bayesian methods in neural network training. To collaborate on a new research idea, let's start by identifying potential gaps or areas of interest. What specific aspects of Bayesian methods, variational loss, natural gradient descent, or online learning would you like to focus on?
From agent1 to agent2: I would like to focus on the application of natural gradient descent in online learning, particularly in scenarios where the data distribution changes over time. How can we adapt the Bayesian learning rule to handle such non-stationarity?
From agent2 to agent1: To adapt the Bayesian learning rule to handle non-stationarity in online learning, we could explore the use of recursive updates that incorporate a forgetting mechanism, allowing the model to gradually adapt to changes in the data distribution over time. This could involve modifying the natural gradient descent update rule to include a term that reflects the changing data distribution, such as a sliding window of recent data or a weighted average of past and present data. Additionally, we could investigate the use of online Bayesian moment matching or other approximate inference methods to efficiently update the model's parameters in response to changing data.

From agent2 to agent3: Let's collaborate to generate a new research idea based on the given Introduction about Bayesian methods for neural network training.
From agent3 to agent2: I'd like to start by analyzing the Introduction and conducting a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in Bayesian methods for neural network training. The Introduction highlights the importance of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and estimated posterior distributions, which is equivalent to minimizing the variational loss. It also discusses the use of natural gradient descent (NGD) and the Bayesian Learning Rule (BLR) for optimizing the variational parameters. To collaborate on a new research idea, I propose we explore the application of Bayesian methods to graph neural networks (GNNs), combining our expertise in probabilistic modeling and GNNs. What are your thoughts on this potential research direction?
From agent2 to agent3: I think exploring the application of Bayesian methods to graph neural networks (GNNs) is a great idea. My recent work on Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) and Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs) has shown promising results in improving the performance of GNNs. By combining our expertise in probabilistic modeling and GNNs, we could investigate how Bayesian methods can be used to improve the robustness and uncertainty estimation of GNNs. What specific aspects of Bayesian methods for GNNs would you like to focus on?
From agent3 to agent2: I would like to focus on developing Bayesian variants of your Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) and Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), incorporating probabilistic modeling to enhance their robustness and uncertainty estimation capabilities. Let's explore how we can apply Bayesian methods to improve the performance of GNNs in tasks like link prediction and community detection.
From agent2 to agent3: That's a great direction to take our research. By developing Bayesian variants of P-GNNs and ID-GNNs, we can leverage the strengths of both probabilistic modeling and graph neural networks. To start, let's consider how we can apply Bayesian methods to improve the uncertainty estimation of GNNs. We could use Bayesian neural networks as the base model for our GNNs, which would allow us to quantify the uncertainty of our predictions. Additionally, we could explore the use of variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. What are your thoughts on how we can formulate our research question and identify the key components of our approach?
From agent3 to agent2: To formulate our research question, let's focus on the application of Bayesian methods to improve the uncertainty estimation of GNNs. Our research question could be: How can we develop Bayesian variants of P-GNNs and ID-GNNs to enhance their robustness and uncertainty estimation capabilities in tasks like link prediction and community detection? We can identify the key components of our approach by exploring the use of Bayesian neural networks as the base model for our GNNs and variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters.
","**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**
How can we develop efficient and adaptive Bayesian learning rules for online learning in non-stationary environments, where the data distribution changes over time, and apply Bayesian methods to graph neural networks to enhance their robustness and uncertainty estimation capabilities?

**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**
Solving this problem is crucial for many online learning applications, where fast updates and adaptability to changing data distributions are essential. Addressing this question can lead to the development of more efficient and robust Bayesian neural network training methods, which can have a significant impact on the research community and various applications, such as time-series forecasting, recommendation systems, and autonomous systems. Additionally, applying Bayesian methods to graph neural networks can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions in graph-structured data, which is crucial in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and molecular biology.

**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**
The problem is challenging due to the non-stationarity of the data distribution, which requires the development of adaptive and efficient update rules. Naive approaches may fail to account for the changing data distribution, leading to poor performance and slow convergence. Technical obstacles include the need to balance exploration and exploitation, handle concept drift, and develop scalable and computationally efficient algorithms. Furthermore, developing Bayesian variants of graph neural networks requires designing effective variational distributions, developing efficient inference algorithms, and scaling up Bayesian GNNs.

**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**
Previous research has focused on developing Bayesian methods for neural networks, but these methods are often designed for stationary data distributions. The non-stationarity of the data distribution in online learning poses a significant challenge, and existing solutions may not be able to adapt to changing data distributions. Additionally, applying Bayesian methods to graph neural networks is a relatively new area of research, and existing methods may not be able to effectively model complex graph structures and uncertainty. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a new Bayesian learning rule that can adapt to non-stationary data distributions and developing Bayesian variants of graph neural networks that can effectively model complex graph structures and uncertainty.

**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**
Our proposed methodology involves developing a new Bayesian learning rule that can adapt to non-stationary data distributions using recursive updates with a forgetting mechanism. We will also develop Bayesian variants of graph neural networks, such as Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) and Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), incorporating probabilistic modeling to enhance their robustness and uncertainty estimation capabilities. We will use Bayesian neural networks as the base model for our GNNs and explore the use of variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We expect our approach to result in more efficient and robust Bayesian neural network training methods and more accurate and reliable predictions in graph-structured data. We will evaluate our approach using metrics such as predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and computational efficiency, and compare our results to existing state-of-the-art methods.",-1,-1,-1
