due to the frequent execution of vacuuming operations.\n2. **FETCH_LARGE_DATA** - based on the execution times of SELECT queries.\n\nPlease make the decision after exploring all root causes, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions. Therefore, the final choice of the two most likely causes of the database performance issues is **VACUUM** and **FETCH_LARGE_DATA**.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": []}]}
