# BudgetBuddy - Finance Management System

# Frontend: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to input and manage their financial data, visualize their savings and expenses through interactive charts and graphs, and receive personalized financial advice. The frontend should be responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Backend: Implement a robust backend system that securely handles user data, including saving, retrieving, and processing financial information from various sources. The backend should support real-time data synchronization and provide APIs for data exchange with third-party financial services.

# Database: Design a scalable and secure database schema to store user profiles, financial transactions, savings goals, and expense categories. Ensure the database supports efficient querying and data retrieval to facilitate real-time updates and reporting.

# Multi-Agent Collaboration: The system should support collaboration between frontend and backend developers to ensure seamless integration of user interface components and backend services. Additionally, the system should facilitate collaboration between data analysts and financial advisors to provide users with accurate and actionable financial advice based on their data.
