# Frontend Implementation
# Frontend code can be implemented using a web framework like Flask or Django to create the interactive map interface.

# Database Implementation
# Database can be implemented using a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store game data, player information, etc.

# Main Implementation
