However, both queries returned no data, indicating that there are currently no lock contention issues in the database.

Here are the details of the queries executed:

1. **Query:** `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;`
   - **Result:** No data returned.

2. **Query:** `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE granted = false;`
   - **Result:** No data returned.

This suggests that there are no active lock waits or contention issues at this time. If you need further investigation or have other areas to explore, please let me know!
