[2025-02-08 01:48:55,789] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent4' planned task: Based on the results from the initial queries, the next task for agent 'agent4' should be to analyze the results from the `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_indexes` queries to identify potential redundant indexes.

The results from the `pg_stat_user_indexes` query will show which indexes are being used the most, and the results from the `pg_indexes` query will provide a comprehensive view of all indexes and their definitions.

Agent 'agent4' should look for the following indicators of redundant indexes:

* Indexes with low or zero `idx_scan` values, indicating that they are rarely or never used.
* Indexes with similar definitions on the same table, which could indicate redundancy.
* Indexes that are not being used despite being defined on columns that are frequently used in WHERE or JOIN clauses.

After analyzing the results, agent 'agent4' should share the findings with other agents to cross-correlate with their investigations into other potential root causes.

The next task could be to query the `pg_stat_user_tables` table to gather information about table usage and statistics, which can help in understanding the overall database performance and identifying potential bottlenecks.

Here's a suggested query:

```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    relname, 
    seq_scan, 
    seq_tup_read, 
    idx_scan, 
    idx_tup_fetch, 
    n_live_tup, 
    n_dead_tup 
FROM 
    pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY 
    seq_scan DESC;
```

This query will provide information about table usage, including the number of sequential scans, index scans, and live and dead tuples, which can help in identifying potential performance bottlenecks.

Additionally, agent 'agent4' could also query the `pg_locks` table to gather information about lock contention, which can help in understanding potential performance issues related to concurrent access to database resources.

Here's a suggested query:

```sql
SELECT 
    pid, 
    mode, 
    granted, 
    relname, 
    transactionid 
FROM 
    pg_locks 
ORDER BY 
    mode DESC;
```

This query will provide information about the current locks held by each process, including the mode, granted status, relation name, and transaction ID, which can help in identifying potential lock contention issues.

By analyzing the results from these queries and sharing the findings with other agents, agent 'agent4' can help identify the root cause of the performance issues and provide recommendations for improvement.

[2025-02-08 01:48:59,298] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent5' planned task: Based on the provided information and the results from the initial query, the next task should involve analyzing the results to understand which tables and operations are most impacted. Since the actual results of the query are not provided, I'll outline a general approach based on potential findings.

To determine the next task, let's analyze the information provided and the results from the initial query.

The initial query is designed to fetch the top 10 SELECT queries from `pg_stat_statements` that have the highest total execution time. This is aimed at identifying queries that might be contributing to performance issues, possibly due to fetching large amounts of data (`FETCH_LARGE_DATA`).

Given the context, the next steps should involve analyzing the results of this query to understand which tables and operations are most impacted. 

Here are some potential next steps:

### 1. Analyze Query Results

Look at the queries returned by the initial SQL query. Identify if there are any common patterns, such as:

* Frequent access to specific tables (e.g., `students`, `courses`, `enrollments`, `payments`).
* Use of specific columns or joins that could be optimized.
* Presence of subqueries, complex WHERE clauses, or ORDER BY operations without proper indexing.

### 2. Check for Indexes

Since `MISSING_INDEXES` is a potential root cause, the next task could involve checking the existing indexes on the tables identified in the query analysis. This can be done using SQL queries like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename IN ('students', 'courses', 'enrollments', 'payments');
```
This helps in understanding if the columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses are properly indexed.

### 3. Investigate Lock Contention

To assess `LOCK_CONTENTION`, you might want to check for any long-running transactions or locks that could be blocking other queries. This can be explored using:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE relation IN (SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN ('students', 'courses', 'enrollments', 'payments'));
```
And for transactions:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' AND query NOTILIKE '%pg_stat_activity%';
```

### 4. CPU and Memory Usage

While the initial query focuses on disk I/O (through `total_exec_time`), it's also crucial to monitor CPU and memory usage to rule out `CPU_CONTENTION`. This might involve system-level monitoring tools rather than SQL

[2025-02-08 01:49:15,655] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent1' planned task: Based on the results from the initial query and the context provided, the next task should involve analyzing the results to determine if `INSERT_LARGE_DATA` is indeed a potential root cause of the performance issues. 

Since the query results are not provided, let's assume that the results show some INSERT operations taking a significant amount of time, which could indicate `INSERT_LARGE_DATA` as a potential root cause. However, to make a comprehensive decision, it's essential to investigate other potential causes as well.

The next tasks should be assigned to different agents to analyze the possibilities of other root causes:

1. **Assign Agent 2 to analyze the possibility of MISSING_INDEXES**: This agent would run the query to check for missing indexes and report back on any findings.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE seq_scan > 0 AND idx_scan = 0;
```

2. **Assign Agent 3 to investigate LOCK_CONTENTION**: This agent would query `pg_locks` and `pg_stat_activity` to check for any transactions holding locks for an extended period and report on any potential lock contention issues.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pg_locks 
WHERE mode = 'exclusive' 
AND granted = false;
```

3. **Assign Agent 4 to look into VACUUM and REDUNDANT_INDEX issues**: This agent would check the last vacuum time for tables, ensure auto-vacuum is enabled and running regularly, and examine indexes for any redundancy or lack of use.

4. **Assign Agent 5 to investigate FETCH_LARGE_DATA, POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE, and CPU_CONTENTION**: This agent would analyze queries for large data fetches, poor join performance, and high CPU usage, potentially using `pg_stat_statements` and other system views to identify problematic queries.

By dividing the tasks among different agents and having them report back, it will be possible to gather a comprehensive understanding of the database's performance issues and make an informed decision on the root cause.

The next task for Agent 1 would be to analyze the results from the initial query and wait for the reports from the other agents to make a comprehensive decision on the root cause of the performance issues. 

Here is an example of how Agent 1 could proceed:
```sql

[2025-02-08 01:49:20,029] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent2' planned task: Based on the information provided and the results from the initial queries, the next task should be to analyze the possibility of `MISSING_INDEXES` as a root cause.

To do this, an agent can query the `pg_stat_user_tables` and `pg_stat_user_indexes` views to identify tables and indexes with high usage. A suitable query could be:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, relname, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, idx_scan, idx_tup_fetch, n_live_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY seq_scan DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
This query will provide insights into the 10 tables with the highest number of sequential scans, which can indicate high load and potentially missing indexes.

Additionally, the agent can query the `pg_stat_user_indexes` view to identify indexes with low usage:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, relname, indexrelname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan ASC
LIMIT 10;
```
This query will provide insights into the 10 indexes with the lowest number of scans, which can indicate that the index is not being used effectively.

By analyzing the results from these queries, the agent can determine if `MISSING_INDEXES` is a significant issue and make recommendations for further investigation or optimization.

The next tasks could be:

1. Analyze the results from the `pg_stat_user_tables` query to identify tables with high load.
2. Examine the results from the `pg_stat_user_indexes` query to identify indexes with low usage.
3. Communicate with other agents to share findings and coordinate efforts to rule out other causes.

Example of a query to analyze index usage:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, relname, indexrelname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
This query will provide insights into the 10 indexes with the highest number of scans, which can indicate effective index usage.

By analyzing the results from these queries and communicating with other agents, the agent can determine if `MISSING_INDEXES` is a significant issue and make recommendations for further investigation or optimization.

Next, I would recommend to check for `POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE` as a potential root cause. This can be done by querying the `pg_stat_statements` view to identify queries with high execution time and analyzing the query plans to identify potential join performance

The query executed to investigate VACUUM operations has been run multiple times, but the results of this query are not provided. However, the next query executed is:
```sql
SELECT query, total_exec_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE 'INSERT%' 
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
This query aims to identify any INSERT operations that might be contributing to the performance issues by looking at the total execution time of these operations. The results of this query will show us the top 10 INSERT queries with the highest total execution time, which can help us determine if large inserts are a significant contributor to the performance issues.

By analyzing the results of this query, we can determine if **INSERT_LARGE_DATA** is a potential root cause of the performance issues. If the results indicate that large inserts are a significant contributor, further investigation into the insert operations and the data being inserted may be warranted.

The next steps could involve:

1. **Analyze INSERT Query Results**: Look at the results from the INSERT query to see if there are any indications of large or inefficient insert operations.
2. **Investigate Index Usage**: Ensure that appropriate indexes are in place to support the insert operations.
3. **Check for Lock Contention**: Investigate if lock contention is occurring due to the insert operations.
4. **Investigate CPU and Memory Usage**: Check if high CPU or memory usage is occurring due to the insert operations.

By following these steps, we can determine if **INSERT_LARGE_DATA** is a potential root cause of the performance issues and take appropriate actions to address it. 

Here is a SQL query to check for CPU and memory usage:
```sql
SELECT 
  pid, 
  usename, 
  application_name, 
  client_addr, 
  query_start, 
  state,

  mem_usage
FROM 
  pg_stat_activity
WHERE 
  cpu_usage > 0 OR mem_usage > 0
ORDER BY 
  cpu_usage DESC, 
  mem_usage DESC;
```
This query will show us the current CPU and memory usage for each process, which can help us identify if high CPU or memory usage is occurring due to the insert operations.

This query will provide insights into the query plan and execution time of the `SELECT` statement, which can help identify potential join performance issues.

By analyzing the results from these queries, the agent can determine if `POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE` is a significant issue and make recommendations for further investigation or optimization.

The next tasks could be:

1. Analyze the results from the `pg_stat_statements` query to identify queries with high execution time.
2. Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to analyze the query plans and identify potential join performance issues.
3. Communicate with other agents to share findings and coordinate efforts to rule out other causes.

Example of a query to analyze query plans:
```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM courses JOIN enrollments ON courses.id = enrollments.course_id;
```
This query will provide insights into the query plan and execution time of the `SELECT` statement, which can help identify potential join performance issues.

By analyzing the results from these queries and communicating with other agents, the agent can determine if `POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE` is a significant issue and make recommendations for further investigation or optimization.

After analyzing the results from the queries, the agent should communicate with other agents to share findings and coordinate efforts to rule out other causes. The agents can discuss the results and determine the next course of action.

Based on the results, the agents can determine if `LOCK_CONTENTION`, `MISSING_INDEXES`, or `POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE` is the root cause of the performance issues. If none of these are the root cause, the

[2025-02-08 01:50:02,866] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent3' planned task: Based on the information provided and the results from the query executed so far, the next task should be to investigate the possibility of **MISSING_INDEXES** as a root cause of the performance issues.

The previous queries have investigated VACUUM operations and INSERT operations, but the results of these queries have not indicated a clear cause of the performance issues. Therefore, the next step should be to investigate index usage to determine if missing indexes are contributing to the performance issues.

A query to check for missing indexes could be:
```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  relname, 
  indexrelname, 
  idx_scan, 
  idx_tup_read, 
  idx_tup_fetch 
FROM 
  pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE 
  idx_scan = 0 AND idx_tup_read > 0;
```
This query will show us the indexes that are not being used, which can help us identify if missing indexes are a significant contributor to the performance issues.

Additionally, a query to check for index usage could be:
```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  relname, 
  indexrelname, 
  idx_scan, 
  idx_tup_read, 
  idx_tup_fetch 
FROM 
  pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY 
  idx_scan DESC;
```
This query will show us the indexes that are being used the most, which can help us identify if there are any indexes that are not being used effectively.

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can determine if **MISSING_INDEXES** is a potential root cause of the performance issues and take appropriate actions to address it.

The next steps could involve:

1. **Analyze Index Query Results**: Look at the results from the index queries to see if there are any indications of missing or ineffective indexes.
2. **Create Missing Indexes**: Create indexes on columns that are used frequently in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
3. **Monitor Index Usage**: Monitor index usage to ensure that the new indexes are being used effectively.
4. **Investigate Other Root Causes**: Continue to investigate other potential root causes of the performance issues, such as LOCK_CONTENTION, REDUNDANT_INDEX, FETCH_LARGE_DATA, POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE, and CPU_CONTENTION.

[2025-02-08 01:50:07,677] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent4' planned task: Based on the results from the initial queries, the next task for agent 'agent4' should be to analyze the results from the `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_indexes` queries to identify potential redundant indexes.

The results from the `pg_stat_user_indexes` query will show which indexes are being used the most, and the results from the `pg_indexes` query will provide a comprehensive view of all indexes and their definitions.

Agent 'agent4' should look for the following indicators of redundant indexes:

* Indexes with low or zero `idx_scan` values, indicating that they are rarely or never used.
* Indexes with similar definitions on the same table, which could indicate redundancy.
* Indexes that are not being used despite being defined on columns that are frequently used in WHERE or JOIN clauses.

After analyzing the results, agent 'agent4' should share the findings with other agents to cross-correlate with their investigations into other potential root causes.

The next task could be to query the `pg_stat_user_tables` table to gather information about table usage and statistics, which can help in understanding the overall database performance and identifying potential bottlenecks.

Here's a suggested query:

```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    relname, 
    seq_scan, 
    seq_tup_read, 
    idx_scan, 
    idx_tup_fetch, 
    n_live_tup, 
    n_dead_tup 
FROM 
    pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY 
    seq_scan DESC;
```

This query will provide information about table usage, including the number of sequential scans, index scans, and live and dead tuples, which can help in identifying potential performance bottlenecks.

Additionally, agent 'agent4' could also query the `pg_locks` table to gather information about lock contention, which can help in understanding potential performance issues related to concurrent access to database resources.

Here's a suggested query:

```sql
SELECT 
    pid, 
    mode, 
    granted, 
    relname, 
    transactionid 
FROM 
    pg_locks 
ORDER BY 
    mode DESC;
```

This query will provide information about the current locks held by each process, including the mode, granted status, relation name, and transaction ID, which can help in identifying potential lock contention issues.

By analyzing the results from these queries and sharing the findings with other agents, agent 'agent4' can help identify the root cause of the performance issues and provide recommendations for improvement.

Based on the results

[2025-02-08 01:50:11,321] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent5' planned task: Based on the provided information and the results from the initial query, the next task should involve analyzing the results to understand which tables and operations are most impacted. Since the actual results of the query are not provided, I'll outline a general approach based on potential findings.

To determine the next task, let's analyze the information provided and the results from the initial query.

The initial query is designed to fetch the top 10 SELECT queries from `pg_stat_statements` that have the highest total execution time. This is aimed at identifying queries that might be contributing to performance issues, possibly due to fetching large amounts of data (`FETCH_LARGE_DATA`).

Given the context, the next steps should involve analyzing the results of this query to understand which tables and operations are most impacted. 

Here are some potential next steps:

### 1. Analyze Query Results

Look at the queries returned by the initial SQL query. Identify if there are any common patterns, such as:

* Frequent access to specific tables (e.g., `students`, `courses`, `enrollments`, `payments`).
* Use of specific columns or joins that could be optimized.
* Presence of subqueries, complex WHERE clauses, or ORDER BY operations without proper indexing.

### 2. Check for Indexes

Since `MISSING_INDEXES` is a potential root cause, the next task could involve checking the existing indexes on the tables identified in the query analysis. This can be done using SQL queries like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename IN ('students', 'courses', 'enrollments', 'payments');
```
This helps in understanding if the columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses are properly indexed.

### 3. Investigate Lock Contention

To assess `LOCK_CONTENTION`, you might want to check for any long-running transactions or locks that could be blocking other queries. This can be explored using:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE relation IN (SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN ('students', 'courses', 'enrollments', 'payments'));
```
And for transactions:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' AND query NOTILIKE '%pg_stat_activity%';
```

### 4. CPU and Memory Usage

While the initial query focuses on disk I/O (through `total_exec_time`), it's also crucial to monitor CPU and memory usage to rule out `CPU_CONTENTION`. This might involve system-level monitoring tools rather than SQL
