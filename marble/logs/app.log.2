Message(content="The agents' results summary for the task is as follows:\n\n**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\nHow can we induce selective task-specific representations to filter irrelevant sensory input and retain only necessary stimuli?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\nSolving this problem can advance knowledge in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, leading to more efficient AI agents. It can also have practical applications in improving AI performance in goal-directed tasks.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\nThe challenge lies in developing a mechanism that can accurately filter out irrelevant information while retaining task-relevant stimuli. Naive approaches may struggle to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant details in complex environments.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\nPrevious research has focused on general-purpose visual encoders without specific mechanisms for filtering out irrelevant information. The proposed approach differs by incorporating selective attention mechanisms inspired by cognitive psychology and neuroscience.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\nThe proposed methodology involves integrating a codebook bottleneck into visual encoders to retain task-relevant information.

Message(content='**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively recognize harmful or inappropriate visual content, especially in the context of underage children encountering such materials online?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for ensuring online safety, particularly for vulnerable populations like children. Addressing this issue can lead to the development of more effective recognition methods and contribute to the broader research community by advancing knowledge in the field of harmful content detection.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity lies in the need for high-quality training datasets, the ambiguity in defining "harmful" content, and the challenges of detecting synthesized harmful materials. Naive approaches may fail due to the diverse nature of harmful content and the limitations of existing datasets.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn\'t it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by narrow datasets, lack of consideration for context in harmful content detection, and a focus on real-world images rather than synthesized or video content. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing a scalable multimodal dataset and a novel annotation framework that addresses these limitations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves collecting raw images and videos, utilizing pretrained vision-language models for annotation, and employing a "debate" framework to enhance the reliability of the dataset. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive dataset with diverse aspects of harmful content detection and the identification of 10 harmful categories representing the contents of all images and videos.', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None)
