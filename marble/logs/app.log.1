[2024-12-14 14:34:58,055] [DEBUG] [EnginePlanner]: Created prompt for task assignment:
You are an orchestrator assigning tasks to a group of agents based on their profiles and current progress and task description.

Task Description:
This database is used for a Manufacturing system that tracks customers, products, suppliers, orders, inventory, raw materials, manufacturing orders, and payments. It includes relationships between orders, manufacturing, and inventory management to ensure smooth manufacturing operations.
Recently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and query the RAG system to get related information, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA,CORRELATED_SUBQUERY', 'POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.

  Profile: agent5 will explore the possibility of FETCH_LARGE_DATA as a root cause. Recommended to search for SELECTs from `pg_stat_statements`.
Based on the current progress and agent profiles, assign the next task to each agent that needs to perform an action.
Provide the assignments in the following JSON format:

{
  "tasks": {
    "agent1": "...", 
    "agent2": "...", 
    // Add more agents as needed
  },
  "continue": true // Set to false if the task is completed
}

If an agent does not need to be assigned a task, you can omit it from the 'tasks' section.

[2024-12-14 14:35:22,615] [DEBUG] [EnginePlanner]: Created prompt for task assignment:
You are an orchestrator assigning tasks to a group of agents based on their profiles and current progress and task description.

Task Description:
This database is used for a Manufacturing system that tracks customers, products, suppliers, orders, inventory, raw materials, manufacturing orders, and payments. It includes relationships between orders, manufacturing, and inventory management to ensure smooth manufacturing operations.
Recently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and query the RAG system to get related information, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA,CORRELATED_SUBQUERY', 'POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.


Current Progress: Starting the simulation.

- {'agent2': 'Result from the model:I have investigated the lock contention by querying the `pg_locks` table.

However, since there are no locks not granted, it seems that the system is currently stable without any contention issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt this moment, there is no evidence of lock contention causing issues in the database. The locks that are granted are functioning as expected, and there are no blocked transactions. If lock contention were to arise, it would typically be indicated by a significant number of locks not granted, which is not the case here. \n\nIf you need further analysis or specific queries, please let me know!\n'}
- {'agent3': 'Result from the model:I have conducted an analysis regarding the VACUUM operations in the database. Here are the findings:\n\n1. **VACUUM Statistics**:\n   - The query to retrieve statistics from `pg_stat_statements` for VACUUM operations returned no data. This indicates that there have been no recorded VACUUM operations in the query statistics, suggesting that either VACUUM has not been executed recently or it has not been logged.\n\n2. **Dead Tuples Analysis**:\n   - The query on `pg_stat_all_tables` revealed several tables with dead tuples, which are records that have been deleted or obsoleted by an update but are still occupying space until a VACUUM operation is performed. Here are the details:\n     - `pg_authid`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 1 dead tuple.\n     - `pg_database`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 5 dead tuples.\n     - Other tables like `pg_toast_2619`, `pg_class`, `pg_rewrite`, etc., have varying numbers of dead tuples but have not been vacuumed recently.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The absence of recorded VACUUM operations in `pg_stat_statements` combined with the presence of dead tuples in several tables suggests that the database may not be performing VACUUM operations as needed.

You are an orchestrator assigning tasks to a group of agents based on their profiles and current progress and task description.

Task Description:
This database is used for a Manufacturing system that tracks customers, products, suppliers, orders, inventory, raw materials, manufacturing orders, and payments. It includes relationships between orders, manufacturing, and inventory management to ensure smooth manufacturing operations.
Recently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and query the RAG system to get related information, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA,CORRELATED_SUBQUERY', 'POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.


Current Progress: Starting the simulation.

However, since there are no locks not granted, it seems that the system is currently stable without any contention issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt this moment, there is no evidence of lock contention causing issues in the database. The locks that are granted are functioning as expected, and there are no blocked transactions. If lock contention were to arise, it would typically be indicated by a significant number of locks not granted, which is not the case here. \n\nIf you need further analysis or specific queries, please let me know!\n'}
- {'agent3': 'Result from the model:I have conducted an analysis regarding the VACUUM operations in the database. Here are the findings:\n\n1. **VACUUM Statistics**:\n   - The query to retrieve statistics from `pg_stat_statements` for VACUUM operations returned no data. This indicates that there have been no recorded VACUUM operations in the query statistics, suggesting that either VACUUM has not been executed recently or it has not been logged.\n\n2. **Dead Tuples Analysis**:\n   - The query on `pg_stat_all_tables` revealed several tables with dead tuples, which are records that have been deleted or obsoleted by an update but are still occupying space until a VACUUM operation is performed. Here are the details:\n     - `pg_authid`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 1 dead tuple.\n     - `pg_database`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 5 dead tuples.\n     - Other tables like `pg_toast_2619`, `pg_class`, `pg_rewrite`, etc., have varying numbers of dead tuples but have not been vacuumed recently.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The absence of recorded VACUUM operations in `pg_stat_statements` combined with the presence of dead tuples in several tables suggests that the database may not be performing VACUUM operations as needed. This could lead to performance degradation over time due to the accumulation of dead tuples.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- It is advisable to manually trigger a VACUUM operation on the tables with significant dead tuples to reclaim space and improve performance.\n- Additionally, reviewing the autovacuum settings and ensuring that it is properly configured to run regularly could help mitigate this issue in the future.\n'}

However, since there are no locks not granted, it seems that the system is currently stable without any contention issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt this moment, there is no evidence of lock contention causing issues in the database. The locks that are granted are functioning as expected, and there are no blocked transactions. If lock contention were to arise, it would typically be indicated by a significant number of locks not granted, which is not the case here. \n\nIf you need further analysis or specific queries, please let me know!\n'}
- {'agent3': 'Result from the model:I have conducted an analysis regarding the VACUUM operations in the database. Here are the findings:\n\n1. **VACUUM Statistics**:\n   - The query to retrieve statistics from `pg_stat_statements` for VACUUM operations returned no data. This indicates that there have been no recorded VACUUM operations in the query statistics, suggesting that either VACUUM has not been executed recently or it has not been logged.\n\n2. **Dead Tuples Analysis**:\n   - The query on `pg_stat_all_tables` revealed several tables with dead tuples, which are records that have been deleted or obsoleted by an update but are still occupying space until a VACUUM operation is performed.

- {'agent2': 'Result from the model:I have investigated the lock contention by querying the `pg_locks` table. Here are the results:\n\n1. **Locks Granted**: \n   - There are currently granted locks in the system:\n     - **AccessShareLock** on relation with ID `16384` and transaction ID `125/2`.\n     - **ExclusiveLock** on virtual transaction ID `125/2`.\n\n2. **Locks Not Granted**: \n   - There are no locks that are currently not granted, indicating that there are no active lock waits at this moment.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The presence of an `AccessShareLock` suggests that there are ongoing read operations on the specified relation, which is normal in a database environment.\n- The `ExclusiveLock` indicates that a transaction is holding an exclusive lock, which may be preventing other transactions from acquiring locks on the same resource. However, since there are no locks not granted, it seems that the system is currently stable without any contention issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt this moment, there is no evidence of lock contention causing issues in the database. The locks that are granted are functioning as expected, and there are no blocked transactions. If lock contention were to arise, it would typically be indicated by a significant number of locks not granted, which is not the case here. \n\nIf you need further analysis or specific queries, please let me know!\n'}

[2024-12-14 14:36:48,843] [DEBUG] [EnginePlanner]: Created prompt for task assignment:
You are an orchestrator assigning tasks to a group of agents based on their profiles and current progress and task description.

Task Description:
This database is used for a Manufacturing system that tracks customers, products, suppliers, orders, inventory, raw materials, manufacturing orders, and payments. It includes relationships between orders, manufacturing, and inventory management to ensure smooth manufacturing operations.
Recently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and query the RAG system to get related information, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA,CORRELATED_SUBQUERY', 'POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.


Current Progress: Starting the simulation.

- {'agent3': 'Result from the model:I have conducted an analysis regarding the VACUUM operations in the database. Here are the findings:\n\n1. **VACUUM Statistics**:\n   - The query to retrieve statistics from `pg_stat_statements` for VACUUM operations returned no data. This indicates that there have been no recorded VACUUM operations in the query statistics, suggesting that either VACUUM has not been executed recently or it has not been logged.\n\n2. **Dead Tuples Analysis**:\n   - The query on `pg_stat_all_tables` revealed several tables with dead tuples, which are records that have been deleted or obsoleted by an update but are still occupying space until a VACUUM operation is performed. Here are the details:\n     - `pg_authid`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 1 dead tuple.\n     - `pg_database`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 5 dead tuples.\n     - Other tables like `pg_toast_2619`, `pg_class`, `pg_rewrite`, etc., have varying numbers of dead tuples but have not been vacuumed recently.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The absence of recorded VACUUM operations in `pg_stat_statements` combined with the presence of dead tuples in several tables suggests that the database may not be performing VACUUM operations as needed. This could lead to performance degradation over time due to the accumulation of dead tuples.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- It is advisable to manually trigger a VACUUM operation on the tables with significant dead tuples to reclaim space and improve performance.\n- Additionally, reviewing the autovacuum settings and ensuring that it is properly configured to run regularly could help mitigate this issue in the future.\n'}

This could be due to:\n  - The queries not filtering on the indexed columns.\n  - The application logic not requiring these indexes.\n  - Potential redundancy if multiple indexes exist on the same columns.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Review Query Patterns**: Analyze the queries being executed against these tables to determine why these indexes are not being used.\n2. **Consider Dropping Unused Indexes**: If certain indexes are confirmed to be unnecessary, consider dropping them to improve performance and reduce storage overhead.\n3. **Consolidate Indexes**: If there are multiple indexes on similar columns, consider consolidating them into a single index to reduce redundancy.\n\nThis investigation highlights the importance of regularly reviewing index usage to ensure optimal database performance.\n'}

- {'agent3': 'Result from the model:I have conducted an analysis regarding the VACUUM operations in the database. Here are the findings:\n\n1. **VACUUM Statistics**:\n   - The query to retrieve statistics from `pg_stat_statements` for VACUUM operations returned no data. This indicates that there have been no recorded VACUUM operations in the query statistics, suggesting that either VACUUM has not been executed recently or it has not been logged.\n\n2. **Dead Tuples Analysis**:\n   - The query on `pg_stat_all_tables` revealed several tables with dead tuples, which are records that have been deleted or obsoleted by an update but are still occupying space until a VACUUM operation is performed. Here are the details:\n     - `pg_authid`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 1 dead tuple.\n     - `pg_database`: Last vacuumed on December 14, 2024, with 5 dead tuples.\n     - Other tables like `pg_toast_2619`, `pg_class`, `pg_rewrite`, etc., have varying numbers of dead tuples but have not been vacuumed recently.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The absence of recorded VACUUM operations in `pg_stat_statements` combined with the presence of dead tuples in several tables suggests that the database may not be performing VACUUM operations as needed. This could lead to performance degradation over time due to the accumulation of dead tuples.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- It is advisable to manually trigger a VACUUM operation on the tables with significant dead tuples to reclaim space and improve performance.\n- Additionally, reviewing the autovacuum settings and ensuring that it is properly configured to run regularly could help mitigate this issue in the future.\n'}
- {'agent4': 'Result from the model:### Redundant Index Analysis Report\n\n#### Redundant Indexes Identified\nThe following indexes have not been scanned at all (`idx_scan = 0`):\n\n1. **customers_contact_email_key** on the `customers` table\n2. **suppliers_pkey** on the `suppliers` table\n3. **suppliers_contact_email_key** on the `suppliers` table\n4. **order_items_pkey** on the `order_items` table\n5. **inventory_pkey** on the `inventory` table\n6. **manufacturing_inventory_pkey** on the `manufacturing_inventory` table\n7. **payments_pkey** on the `payments` table\n\n#### Index Definitions\nThe indexes are defined as follows:\n\n- **customers_contact_email_key**: Unique index on `contact_email` in the `customers` table.\n- **suppliers_pkey**: Unique index on `supplier_id` in the `suppliers` table.\n- **suppliers_contact_email_key**: Unique index on `contact_email` in the `suppliers` table.\n- **order_items_pkey**: Unique index on `order_item_id` in the `order_items` table.\n- **inventory_pkey**: Unique index on `inventory_id` in the `inventory` table.\n- **manufacturing_inventory_pkey**: Unique index on `manufacturing_inventory_id` in the `manufacturing_inventory` table.\n- **payments_pkey**: Unique index on `payment_id` in the `payments` table.\n\n#### Analysis\nThe presence of indexes with zero scans indicates that these indexes are not being utilized by any queries. This could be due to:\n- The queries not filtering on the indexed columns.\n- The application logic not requiring these indexes.\n- Potential redundancy if multiple indexes exist on the same columns.\n\n#### Recommendations\n1. **Review Query Patterns**: Analyze the queries being executed against these tables to determine why these indexes are not being used.\n2. **Consider Dropping Unused Indexes**: If certain indexes are confirmed to be unnecessary, consider dropping them to improve performance and reduce storage overhead.\n3. **Consolidate Indexes**: If there are multiple indexes on similar columns, consider consolidating them into a single index to reduce redundancy.\n\nThis investigation highlights the importance of regularly reviewing index usage to ensure optimal database performance.\n'}
