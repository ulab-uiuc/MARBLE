It consists of five main tables: customers, products, orders, order items, and payments, with foreign key relationships between them.
Recently, during operation, the database has seen performance issues. Use sql queries to find out what is wrong, and find out the reason that caused it. The root cause can be only two of the following: 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA', 'MISSING_INDEXES', 'LOCK_CONTENTION', 'VACUUM', 'REDUNDANT_INDEX', 'FETCH_LARGE_DATA', 'POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE,CPU_CONTENTION'. The planner should assign different agent to analyze possbility for each root cause and make final decision. Agents can also chat with each other to share information.  Please make the decision after using all these tools, as a premature decision may lead to incorrect conclusions.
