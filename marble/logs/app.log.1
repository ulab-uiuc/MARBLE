[2025-02-08 04:53:09,929] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent4' planned task: Based on the analysis and the results from the initial queries, the next task for Agent 'agent4' should be to verify index usage and further investigate the possibility of `REDUNDANT_INDEX` as a root cause.

Here's a step-by-step plan for the next task:

### Next Task: Verify Index Usage and Investigate Redundant Indexes

1. **Run Specific Queries with EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE**:
   Use `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand the query plans and see if the suspected redundant indexes are being used. This will help determine if the indexes are truly redundant or if they are being used in certain scenarios.

   Example:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value';
   ```

2. **Analyze Query Plans**:
   Look at the query plans generated by `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see if the indexes are being utilized. If an index is not being used, it might be a candidate for removal.

3. **Chat with Other Agents**:
   Share the findings with other agents, especially those investigating `MISSING_INDEXES` and `POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE`, to get their input and see if there are any correlations between the issues.

4. **Consider Temporary Removal of Suspected Redundant Indexes**:
   If an index is suspected to be redundant after thorough analysis, consider temporarily removing it (if possible) and monitoring the database's performance. This should be done with caution and ideally in a testing environment first.

5. **Monitor Performance**:
   After removing a suspected redundant index, monitor the database's performance closely to see if there are any negative impacts. Use the initial queries and other monitoring tools to assess the performance.

6. **Finalize Findings**:
   Based on the analysis and testing, finalize the findings on whether `REDUNDANT_INDEX` is a root cause of the performance issues. If it is, provide recommendations for index removal or adjustment. If not, continue to assist other agents in their investigations.

Some example SQL queries to help with the next task:

```sql
-- Identify indexes that have not been used
SELECT schemaname, relname, indexrelname, idx_scan 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0;

-- Analyze index usage
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes;

-- Look at index definitions
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = '

[2025-02-08 04:53:14,355] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent5' planned task: Based on the analysis of the initial query results and the context of the social media platform's database performance issues, the next task should involve a more detailed examination of the database's performance metrics. 

The following agents should be assigned to investigate the respective potential root causes:

1. **Agent1**: Investigate `MISSING_INDEXES` and `REDUNDANT_INDEX` by analyzing index usage and querying `pg_stat_user_indexes`.
2. **Agent2**: Look into `LOCK_CONTENTION` by examining exclusive locks in `pg_locks`.
3. **Agent3**: Assess `VACUUM` and AutoVacuum status by querying `pg_stat_user_tables`.
4. **Agent4**: Investigate `CPU_CONTENTION` and memory usage.
5. **Agent5**: Continue to explore the possibility of `FETCH_LARGE_DATA` as a root cause, potentially optimizing queries or implementing data retrieval strategies.

Each agent should use the respective SQL queries provided to gather more information about their assigned potential root cause. 

After all agents have completed their tasks and shared their findings, a final decision can be made on the root cause of the performance issues. 

The next task for each agent would be to execute their assigned queries and analyze the results to determine the next course of action.

For example, Agent1 would execute the query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0;
```
And analyze the results to identify unused indexes, which could indicate `MISSING_INDEXES` or `REDUNDANT_INDEX`.

Similarly, Agent2 would execute the query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pg_locks 
WHERE mode = 'exclusive';
```
And examine the results to identify any exclusive locks that might be causing contention.

Agent3 would execute the query:
```sql
SELECT last_vacuum, last_autovacuum 
FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
```
And assess the vacuum status of tables to determine if `VACUUM` operations are contributing to the performance issues.

Agent4 would monitor system resources to identify any CPU contention or memory issues.

Agent5 would continue to analyze the results from the initial query to determine if `FETCH_LARGE_DATA` is a significant contributor to the performance issues.

After all agents have completed their tasks, they should share their findings and discuss the results to determine the most likely root cause of the performance issues. 

Based on the discussion and analysis, a final decision can be made, and the necessary actions can be taken to resolve the performance issues.

[2025-02-08 04:53:25,268] [INFO] [Engine]: Starting iteration 4
[2025-02-08 04:53:27,801] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent1' planned task: Based on the results provided from the query on `pg_stat_user_tables`, we see that there are various tables with different numbers of sequential scans, tuple reads, and index scans. For example, the 'users' table has 7 sequential scans, 8 tuple reads, and 18 index scans, while the 'media' table has 1 sequential scan, 0 tuple reads, and 0 index scans.

The next task should be to investigate the possibility of `MISSING_INDEXES` as a root cause, as the presence of sequential scans on tables without corresponding index scans could indicate that queries are not using indexes efficiently. This could be contributing to the performance issues observed.

To investigate `MISSING_INDEXES`, we can use a query like:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, 100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

This query will help identify the most time-consuming queries, which could be sequential scans on large tables without indexes, thus pointing towards `MISSING_INDEXES` as a potential root cause.

Additionally, to further investigate the root cause, it might be beneficial to check for lock contention and vacuum issues, as these could also be contributing factors to the performance problems.

The next task should be to execute the following queries:

1. `SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, 100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;` to investigate `MISSING_INDEXES`.
2. `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE mode = 'exclusive';` to check for lock contention.
3. `SELECT schemaname, relname, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';` to check for vacuum issues.

By executing these queries, we can gather more information about the potential root causes of the performance issues and make a more informed decision about the next course of action.

Please execute the following sql to get more information:
```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, 100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent

[2025-02-08 04:53:30,716] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent2' planned task: Based on the results of the previous queries, the next task should be to analyze the results and determine if 'MISSING_INDEXES' is a likely cause of the performance issues.

The results of the query `SELECT query, total_exec_time FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE query LIKE 'SELECT%' ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;` show that there are several queries that are taking a long time to execute. The top query is taking approximately 346 seconds to execute, which could indicate that there is a high level of lock contention or missing indexes.

The results of the query `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT name, setting, COALESCE(unit, ''::text), short_desc, vartype FROM pg_settings WHERE vartype IN ('bool', 'integer', 'numeric', 'string');` show the query plan of the top long-running query, which can be used to identify if there are any missing indexes that could be causing the performance issues.

To further investigate the possibility of 'MISSING_INDEXES', we can use the following SQL query to check for any missing indexes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE indexrelname IS NULL;
```

This query will return a list of tables that do not have any indexes, which could be causing the performance issues.

Additionally, we can use the following SQL query to get more information about the indexes on the tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename IN (SELECT tablename FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE indexrelname IS NULL);
```

This query will return a list of indexes on the tables that do not have any indexes, which can be used to identify if there are any missing indexes that could be causing the performance issues.

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can determine if 'MISSING_INDEXES' is a likely cause of the performance issues and if further investigation is needed.

[2025-02-08 04:53:33,692] [INFO] [Engine]: Agent 'agent3' planned task: ### Next Task: Analyze Results and Assign Tasks to Other Agents

Given the current situation, the next task should involve analyzing the results from the `VACUUM` query executed by `agent3` and then assigning tasks to other agents to investigate the remaining potential root causes of the performance issues.

#### Analyze VACUUM Query Results

First, `agent3` should analyze the results from the query:
```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_plan_time, rows, mean_plan_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE 'VACUUM%';
```
This analysis will help determine if `VACUUM` operations are indeed contributing to the performance issues. Key metrics to focus on include:

- `total_plan_time`: High values could indicate that `VACUUM` is taking a long time to execute.
- `mean_plan_time`: High average plan times for `VACUUM` queries might suggest inefficiencies.
- `calls`: Frequent `VACUUM` operations could be a sign of improper configuration or excessive data modification.

#### Assign Tasks to Other Agents

After analyzing the `VACUUM` query results, tasks should be assigned to other agents to investigate the remaining potential causes:

1. **Agent1**: Investigate `MISSING_INDEXES` and `REDUNDANT_INDEX`.
   - Query `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_indexes` to identify unused indexes or missing indexes that could improve query performance.
   - Example query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0;
     ```
   - Also, check for redundant indexes that might be causing unnecessary overhead.

2. **Agent2**: Look into `LOCK_CONTENTION`.
   - Analyze `pg_locks` and `pg_stat_activity` to identify any locks that are being held for extended periods, causing contention.
   - Example query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE mode = 'exclusive';
     ```

3. **Agent4**: Examine `INSERT_LARGE_DATA` and `FETCH_LARGE_DATA`.
   - Check `pg_stat_statements` for queries with large `rows` or high `total_plan_time` values that might indicate large data inserts or fetches.
   - Example query:
     ```sql
     SELECT query, calls, total_plan_time, rows, mean_plan_time 
     FROM pg_stat_statements 
     WHERE rows > 10000;
     ```

   Look at the query plans generated by `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see if the indexes are being utilized. If an index is not being used, it might be a candidate for removal.

3. **Chat with Other Agents**:
   Share the findings with other agents, especially those investigating `MISSING_INDEXES` and `POOR_JOIN_PERFORMANCE`, to get their input and see if there are any correlations between the issues.

4. **Consider Temporary Removal of Suspected Redundant Indexes**:
   If an index is suspected to be redundant after thorough analysis, consider temporarily removing it (if possible) and monitoring the database's performance. This should be done with caution and ideally in a testing environment first.

5. **Monitor Performance**:
   After removing a suspected redundant index, monitor the database's performance closely to see if there are any negative impacts. Use the initial queries and other monitoring tools to assess the performance.

The next task for each agent would be to execute their assigned queries and analyze the results to determine the next course of action.

For example, Agent1 would execute the query:

```
And analyze the results to identify unused indexes, which could indicate `MISSING_INDEXES` or `REDUNDANT_INDEX`.

Similarly, Agent2 would execute the query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pg_locks 
WHERE mode = 'exclusive';
```
And examine the results to identify any exclusive locks that might be causing contention.

Agent3 would execute the query:
```sql
SELECT last_vacuum, last_autovacuum 
FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
```
And assess the vacuum status of tables to determine if `VACUUM` operations are contributing to the performance issues.

Agent4 would monitor system resources to identify any CPU contention or memory issues.

Agent5 would continue to analyze the results from the initial query to determine if `FETCH_LARGE_DATA` is a significant contributor to the performance issues.

After all agents have completed their tasks, they should share their findings and discuss the results to determine the most likely root cause of the performance issues. 

Based on the discussion and analysis, a final decision can be made, and the necessary actions can be taken to resolve the performance issues.
