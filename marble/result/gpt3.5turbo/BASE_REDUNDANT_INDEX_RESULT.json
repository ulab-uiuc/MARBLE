'INSERT_LARGE_DATA': Agent 1's query on the database returned a large insert statement as the top query by execution time, indicating a potential issue with inserting large amounts of data.\n2. 'LOCK_CONTENTION': Agent 2's query on the database returned lock information, suggesting potential contention and waiting on locks within the database.\n\nTherefore, the root causes of the database anomaly are likely 'INSERT_LARGE_DATA' and 'LOCK_CONTENTION'. Further investigation and analysis should be conducted to confirm these root causes before making a final decision."}}
