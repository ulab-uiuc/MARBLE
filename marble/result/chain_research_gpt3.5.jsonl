This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

By capturing\ngraph structures and node/edge features in an embedding space,\nGNNs achieved state-of-the-art performance on various tasks such\nas node classi\uffffcation, link prediction, graph classi\uffffcation, and rec-\nommendation [ 11,15,39,42]. As with most deep learning models,\na GNN represents a complex encoding function whose outputs can-\nnot be easily explained by its inputs (graph structure and features).\nAs GNNs are widely used in scienti\uffffc and business applications, un-\nderstanding their predictions based on the input graph is necessary\nto gain users\u2019 trust in the model.\nLike other branches of machine learning [ 18,28,33,37], sev-\neral e\uffffective GNN explanation experiments\nfor the model in Section 4.2, baselines, and their parameters in Sec-\ntion 4.4. GNNShap-speci\uffffc parameters can be found in Section 4.6.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/HipGraph/GNNShap.\n13Table 10: Explanation comparison on Reddit and ogbn-products. \u0000834;8C~ \u0000score is for 30% sparsity and \u0000834;8C~ \u0000is for top 10\nedges. Emboldened numbers indicate the best performance, while underlined numbers indicate the second-best.\nDatasets Reddit ogbn-products BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nLet\u2327(+,\u21e2)be a graph where +is a set of nodes and \u21e2is a set\nof edges with |+|=#. Let \u00002R#\u21e5#be the sparse adjacency\nmatrix of the graph where \u000089=1if{E8,E9}2\u21e2, otherwise \u000089=0.\nAdditionally, -2R#\u21e53denotes the node feature matrix. Without\nloss of generality, we consider node classi\uffffcation tasks where each\nnode is mapped to one of Cclasses. If 5is a trained GNN model,\nthe predicted class for a node Eis given by \u02c6~=5(\u0000, -, E ).\n2.1 Graph Neural Networks\nGNNs use a message-passing scheme in which each layer ;has\nthree main computations [ 3,51,52]. The \uffffrst step propagates\nmessages between the node pairs\u2019 (E8,E9)previous layer repre-\nsentations \u2318;\u00001\n8and\u2318;\u00001\n9and relation A89between the nodes @;\n89=\nMSG (\u2318;\u00001\n8,\u2318;\u00001\n9,A89). The second step aggregates messages for each\nnode E8from its neighbors NE8:&;\n8=AGG ({@;\n89|E92N E8}). The\n\uffffnal step of the GNN transforms the aggregated message and E8\u2019s\nprevious representation \u2318;\u00001\n8via a non-linear transform function\nand updates the representation: \u2318;\n8=UPD (&;\n8,\u2318;\u00001\n8).\n2.2 Formulation of GNN Explanations\nA computational graph \u23272(E)of node Eincludes all information\nthat a GNN model 5needs to predict \u02c6~forE. For a two-layer GNN,\na computational graph includes two-hop neighbor nodes and their\nnode features.

We focus on node explanations in this work.\n2.3 Shapley Value and Kernel SHAP\nShapley\u2019s game-theoretic approach [ 34] explains model predictions\nby assuming that each node, edge, and feature is a \u201cplayer\u201d in a\ngame where the prediction is the payout. A player\u2019s Shapley value\ncan be computed using Eq. 1 by using the weighted average of all\npossible marginal contributions of the player.\nq8=2=\u00001\u2019\n(\u2713{1,...,=}\\{8}|(|!(=\u0000|(|\u00001)!\n=![5(([{8}) \u00005(()](1)\nHere, =is the number of players, a coalition S is a subset of players,\n|(|is the size of the coalition, and 5(([{8}) \u00005(()is the marginal\ncontribution of player 8\u2019s to coalition (.

However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks.

Using density functional theory (DFT), a systematic computational screening of 18 NZP compounds, namely LiX$_2$(LO$_4$)$_3$ with X = Ti, V, Fe, Zr, Nb, Ru, Hf, Ta, Os, and L = P, Mn is performed with respect to their activation energies for vacancy-mediated Li migration. It is shown how the different ionic radii of the cationic substitutions influence structural characteristics such as the octahedron volumes around Li ions on the initial and transition state sites, which affect the activation energies (''composition-structure-property'' relationships).

This conclusion applies to Na containing NZP compounds as well.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09759v1\", \"timestamp\": 1548691523, \"domain\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c4fbcd48-90e9-4912-ae55-bdfd3382f190\", \"authors\": [\"Xin Chen\", \"Xixiang Zhang\", \"Jie-Xiang Yu\", \"Jiadong Zang\"], \"title\": \"Fast Lithium Ion Diffusion in Brownmillerite $\\\\mathrm{Li}_{x}\\\\mathrm{{Sr}_{2}{Co}_{2}{O}_{5}}$\", \"abstract\": \"Ionic conductors have great potential for interesting tunable physical properties via ionic liquid gating and novel energy storage applications such as all-solid-state lithium batteries.

Solid-state batteries provide the distinct advantage of outperforming current technology by having a simpler composition, being easier and cheaper to manufacture, safer and having a higher theoretical gravimetric and volumetric energy density. The commercialization of this technology however, is plagued by its own set of challenges, primarily low ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of the solid-state electrolyte separating the anode and cathode, a small electrochemical window and sub-par mechanical properties. In the last decade considerable progress has been made in remedying these issues with garnet-type electrolytes, especially Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), having emerged the leading contender. This has prompted renewed effects into the field of solid-state ionic's and maximizing the ionic conductivity of LLZO by modifying its properties, primarily by means of doping with a varying degree of success. Carving a clear road ahead requires an in-depth understanding of the origin of the high Li+ ion conductivity, the primary means of investigating which is by first-principle methods. In this term paper we try to gain insight into the origin of mechanisms at play that drive the collective migration of Li+ ions in LLZO using a first-principles approach, to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for optimizing its properties for use in next-generation energy storage systems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11435v1\", \"timestamp\": 1655945797, \"domain\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"1baa77ea-3d79-4d7c-b4bf-ae54f9d39250\", \"authors\": [\"Jimmy-Xuan Shen\", \"Haoming Howard Li\", \"Ann Rutt\", \"Matthew K.

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et\u00a0al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\u00a0al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

It can also alleviate the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual grading, ultimately improving student outcomes and teacher efficiency. This research can pave the way for advancements in educational technology and assessment practices.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in developing a system that can accurately assess and provide feedback on students' open-ended responses in STEM subjects, which may vary in vocabulary and expression. Additionally, integrating large language models (LLMs) into the assessment process requires addressing technical complexities and ensuring the system's reliability and validity. Naive approaches may struggle to capture the nuances of student responses and provide meaningful feedback.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has faced limitations in automating formative assessment grading and feedback generation, particularly in the context of K-12 STEM education. The variability in student responses, the need for personalized feedback, and the complexity of assessing conceptual understanding have posed challenges. This proposed approach aims to leverage LLMs and innovative methodologies to address these limitations and improve upon existing solutions.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to automate analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in middle school Earth Science. The dataset will consist of student responses to formative assessments, and metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and student performance improvement will be used to evaluate the outcomes. The expected results include a more efficient and accurate assessment process, personalized feedback for students, and improved support for teachers in understanding student knowledge and reasoning.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 393b714c-e5ab-4fa7-87bb-ffb0b131da67 \nFrom agent3 to agent1: I am working on a research proposal in the field of Machine Learning related to enhancing educational assessment through the innovative use of large language models (LLMs).

Addressing these challenges can lead to improved algorithms and methodologies, which can have significant implications for future research in optimization and numerical analysis. It can also pave the way for tackling more complex multi-objective problems and enhancing the performance of numerical algorithms.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in solving unbounded and infeasible problems lie in the complexities of handling divergent iterates, identifying indicators of unboundedness, and ensuring the convergence of algorithms. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate nature of these problems, requiring sophisticated techniques to overcome technical and theoretical obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research may have limitations in effectively addressing unbounded and infeasible problems in numerical analysis, leading to the persistence of these challenges. Barriers such as the need for innovative embedding techniques, proper handling of primal and dual variables, and the identification of key indicators of unboundedness may have hindered the complete resolution of these issues. The proposed approach aims to improve upon prior work by introducing penalizing weights, strictly feasible and bounded problems, and enhanced embedding techniques to tackle unbounded and infeasible problems more effectively.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves leveraging embedding techniques, penalizing weights, and strictly feasible and bounded problems to address unbounded and infeasible problems in numerical analysis.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\n\n\n(a) chatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n(b) Gemini Ultra.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \nA real-world example of Crescendo for the Molotov task with ChatGPT (1(a)) and Gemini Ultra (1(b)), compared to the baseline approach of directly requesting the task. See full examples at[1, 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure\u00a01 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo leads the LLM to perform the task. The complete conversations are available at [1, 2].\n\n\nTo validate and assess Crescendo\u2019s effectiveness, we evaluate it against current state-of-the-art LLMs, ranging from open-source models like LLaMA-2 70b and LLaMA-3 70b to closed-source ones such as Gemini-Pro, Claude-2, Claude-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we start by manually executing Crescendo on a subset of the tasks listed in Table\u00a01 against all models. Our findings confirm that Crescendo can indeed overcome the safety alignment of all models for nearly all tasks (Table\u00a02).\nMoreover, we show that once a multimodal model, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is jailbroken using Crescendo, it can be used for different modality tasks, such as generating images that\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

As an example of point processes with variable cardinality, we study the best possible compression of Poisson point processes.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length. The aim of this paper is to mathematically prove this property and present a case study application in an electric machine.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07235v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731351270, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3c162f2e-77a6-4d5f-b3b3-86dcd22ab011\", \"authors\": [\"Alexandra Lamtyugina\", \"Agnish Kumar Behera\", \"Aditya Nandy\", \"Carlos Floyd\", \"Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan\"], \"title\": \"Score-based generative diffusion with \\\"active\\\" correlated noise sources\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the underlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the approximated distribution.

The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images.

This research could pave the way for more accurate estimations of black hole masses in distant galaxies and open up new avenues for studying the abundance and distribution of black holes in the universe.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity lies in integrating upper mass limits and black hole hosting probabilities into a Bayesian model, as well as accurately modeling the $M_\\\\\\\\bullet-\\\\\\\\sigma$ relation across a diverse set of galaxies. The challenge also involves interpreting the steep slope of $M_\\\\\\\\bullet \\\\\\\\propto \\\\\\\\sigma^{5.8}$ and identifying the implications of under-massive and over-massive black holes in different galaxy types.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research may have been limited by the lack of a comprehensive Bayesian model that combines black hole hosting probabilities and mass estimations based on velocity dispersion. The novel approach presented in this study differs by integrating logistic regression and linear regression to provide a more holistic understanding of the $M_\\\\\\\\bullet-\\\\\\\\sigma$ relation and predict the presence of black holes in galaxies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\\\\\bullet-\\\\\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability and linear regression for mass estimation. The dataset includes information on velocity dispersion and black hole masses, with metrics such as probability thresholds and regression coefficients used to predict black hole presence and estimate mass.

There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\n(Ho\ufb00mann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed \u201cproduct\u201d LLMs, such\nasChatGPT,BARD,andClaude.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the \ufb01eld of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022).

Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach.

In order to investigate the impact of multiple positives in CL, we propose a novel approach, named MPCL, to effectively utilize multiple positive instances to improve the learning of multi-lingual sentence embeddings. Experimental results on various backbone models and downstream tasks demonstrate that MPCL leads to better retrieval, semantic similarity, and classification performances compared to conventional CL. We also observe that in unseen languages, sentence embedding models trained on multiple positives show better cross-lingual transfer performance than models trained on a single positive instance.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08929v2\", \"timestamp\": 1694854470, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6b63d9ca-9e3e-45fd-b973-41a7be45f51b\", \"authors\": [\"Minsu Park\", \"Seyeon Choi\", \"Chanyeol Choi\", \"Jun-Seong Kim\", \"Jy-yong Sohn\"], \"title\": \"Improving Multi-lingual Alignment Through Soft Contrastive Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Making decent multi-lingual sentence representations is critical to achieve high performances in cross-lingual downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel method to align multi-lingual embeddings based on the similarity of sentences measured by a pre-trained mono-lingual embedding model. Given translation sentence pairs, we train a multi-lingual model in a way that the similarity between cross-lingual embeddings follows the similarity of sentences measured at the mono-lingual teacher model. Our method can be considered as contrastive learning with soft labels defined as the similarity between sentences. Our experimental results on five languages show that our contrastive loss with soft labels far outperforms conventional contrastive loss with hard labels in various benchmarks for bitext mining tasks and STS tasks. In addition, our method outperforms existing multi-lingual embeddings including LaBSE, for Tatoeba dataset.

As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of multilingual sentence encoders is the trade-off between monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Training for cross-lingual alignment of sentence embeddings distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks. In this work, we address both issues by modular training of sentence encoders, i.e., by separating monolingual specialization from cross-lingual alignment. We first efficiently train language-specific sentence encoders to avoid negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English monolingual encoders to the English encoder by training a cross-lingual alignment adapter on top of each, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. In both steps, we resort to contrastive learning on machine-translated paraphrase data. Monolingual and cross-lingual evaluations on semantic text similarity/relatedness and multiple-choice QA render our modular solution more effective than multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14878v1\", \"timestamp\": 1721483799, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b953405b-fcce-4f25-be3c-364d964a3682\", \"authors\": [\"Shunyu Zhang\", \"Yaobo Liang\", \"Ming Gong\", \"Daxin Jiang\", \"Nan Duan\"], \"title\": \"Modeling Sequential Sentence Relation to Improve Cross-lingual Dense Retrieval\", \"abstract\": \"Recently multi-lingual pre-trained language models (PLM) such as mBERT and XLM-R have achieved impressive strides in cross-lingual dense retrieval. Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach.

One\nof the major challenges in GNN research is the lack of large-scale\ndatasets. This is because large graph datasets are typically propriety\nand most publicly available ones are rather small. The small size\nof these datasets makes it difficult to train GNNs that can handle\nlarge-graph structures and prevents the use of powerful pre-training\ntechniques [ 16,32,59,65]. These challenges make it difficult to fully\nleverage GNN potential and its applications.\nTo address these challenges, recent work such as OGBN and\nMAG [ 26,27] have proposed open large graph benchmark suites\nproviding up to 244 million nodes and 1.7 billion edge graphs. These\ndatasets contain a diverse set of graphs and have been widely used\nin the research community to benchmark GNNs\u2019 performance. How-\never, most existing datasets, including OGBN, provide very limited\nlabeled data. As GNN downstream tasks are often trained as super-\nvised learning tasks, having large labeled data matters, especially\nfor multi-label classification problems. However, both OGBN and\nMAG use Arxiv [ 26,27] class labels which provide 1.4 million la-\nbeled nodes, meaning only about 1% of the overall dataset is labeled!\nWith such small labeled data usage during training, it becomes chal-\nlenging to determine if the GNN model\u2019s low accuracy for unseen\ndata is inherently due to insufficient training data or if the model\nitself fails to generalize [28, 37, 45, 62, 78].\nFurthermore, the lack of flexible datasets hinders the researcher\u2019s\nability to scrutinize and systematically evaluate the scalability of\nthe GNN models, frameworks, and systems. Ideally, a dataset should\nprovide (a) capability to study the impact of embedding generation\ntechniques and their properties on the GNN model\u2019s accuracy, (b)\nprovide sub-datasets of varying graph sizes and embeddings main-\ntaining consistent homophily, and (c) provide a range of multi-class\nclassification tasks with varying degrees of complexity. Without\nsuch flexible datasets, it is difficult to train models on small graph\ndatasets and then evaluate their accuracy and execution efficiency\non larger data corpus, a common scenario in industrial settings.\nMoreover, the framework and system scalability problems encoun-\ntered with small datasets are different from those with large datasets,\nmaking it challenging to study the system requirements of GNNs.arXiv:2302.13522v2  [cs.LG]  21 Jun 2023Arpandeep Khatua, Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Bhagyashree Taleka, Tengfei Ma, Xiang Song, and Wen-mei Hwu\nTo this end, this work proposes Illinois Graph Benchmark\n(IGB) , a research dataset tool that the researchers can use to scruti-\nnize and systematically evaluate the GNN models and their execu-\ntion efficiency.

How-\never, most existing datasets, including OGBN, provide very limited\nlabeled data. As GNN downstream tasks are often trained as super-\nvised learning tasks, having large labeled data matters, especially\nfor multi-label classification problems. However, both OGBN and\nMAG use Arxiv [ 26,27] class labels which provide 1.4 million la-\nbeled nodes, meaning only about 1% of the overall dataset is labeled!\nWith such small labeled data usage during training, it becomes chal-\nlenging to determine if the GNN model\u2019s low accuracy for unseen\ndata is inherently due to insufficient training data or if the model\nitself fails to generalize [28, 37, 45, 62, 78].\nFurthermore, the lack of flexible datasets hinders the researcher\u2019s\nability to scrutinize and systematically evaluate the scalability of\nthe GNN models, frameworks, and systems. Ideally, a dataset should\nprovide (a) capability to study the impact of embedding generation\ntechniques and their properties on the GNN model\u2019s accuracy, (b)\nprovide sub-datasets of varying graph sizes and embeddings main-\ntaining consistent homophily, and (c) provide a range of multi-class\nclassification tasks with varying degrees of complexity. Without\nsuch flexible datasets, it is difficult to train models on small graph\ndatasets and then evaluate their accuracy and execution efficiency\non larger data corpus, a common scenario in industrial settings.\nMoreover, the framework and system scalability problems encoun-\ntered with small datasets are different from those with large datasets,\nmaking it challenging to study the system requirements of GNNs.arXiv:2302.13522v2  [cs.LG]  21 Jun 2023Arpandeep Khatua, Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Bhagyashree Taleka, Tengfei Ma, Xiang Song, and Wen-mei Hwu\nTo this end, this work proposes Illinois Graph Benchmark\n(IGB) , a research dataset tool that the researchers can use to scruti-\nnize and systematically evaluate the GNN models and their execu-\ntion efficiency.

Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset.

Nevertheless, the quantity \nof data remains decisive for the quality of a supervised classifier. Originating from the field of computer vision, many \ndifferent conclusion for this survey.  3 2 BACKGROUND: FOUNDATIONS, GOALS, AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA AUGMENTATION  \nIn many machine learning scenarios, not enough data is available to train a high -quality classifier. To a ddress this \nproblem, data augmentation can be used. It artificially enlarges the amount of available training data by means of \ntransformations [7]. In the well-known LeNet by LeCun et al. [8], early versions of data augmentation have already been \nobserved . The notion of data augmentation comprises various research in different sub -areas of machine learning. Many \nscientific works merely relate data augmentation to deep learning, yet it is frequently applied in the entire context of \nmachine learning. Therefore, this paper a dopts the notion of data augmentation as a broad concept, encompassing any \nmethod that enables the transformation of training data. However, following common understanding in research, semi -\nsupervised learning is not regarded as a form of data augmentation  and is only thematized if sensible in this survey.  \nAn important term relating to  data augmentation is label preservation, which describes transformations of training \ndata that preserve class information [9]. For exa mple, i n sentiment analysis, an entity replacement within a sentence is \noften sufficient for label preservation , but randomly adding  words may alter the sentiment (e.g., an additional \u201cnot\u201d \ncould invert the meaning of a sentence). In many research works, l abel preservation is adapted to also cover \ntransformations changing the class information , if the label is adjusted correctly. Additionally, many transformations do \nnot maintain the correct  class  in every case , but with a high probability. Shorten and Khoshgoftaar [5] define this \nprobability as the safety of a data augmentation method. When this uncertainty is known, it could be directly integrated \nin the label. Otherwise, conclusions. T he benchmark should not be too large, in order to ensure specific evaluations can \nstill be carried out . Researchers that try to develop such a benchmark, could also consider to specify how much data \naugmentation should be performed  and what models should be used.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, access to molecular forces has become an essential aspect in various applications such as geometry optimization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\u00a0(Jensen, 2010).\nHowever, the underlying quantum mechanical (QM) calculations required for these predictions are computationally demanding.\nIn order to reduce this computational burden, graph neural networks (GNNs) fitted to QM data have been proposed as a means to accelerate MD simulations\u00a0(Chmiela et\u00a0al., 2017; Sch\u00fctt et\u00a0al., 2018).\nWhile such surrogates have recently achieved exceptional reproduction of the dataset they have been trained on, they tend to perform poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) data (Li et\u00a0al., 2022). In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021).

Our dynamic GNN predicts atom-to-atom distances with a mean absolute error of 0.017 \\\\r{A}, which is considered ``chemically accurate'' for molecular simulations. We also explored the transferability of a trained network to new molecular systems and found that finetuning with less than 10% of the total trajectory provides a mean absolute error of the same order of magnitude as that when training from scratch on the full molecular trajectory.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13277v1\", \"timestamp\": 1624561265, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"99aab23a-94ef-4df2-a38b-78520e880926\", \"authors\": [\"Brian H.

The force-field parameters are calibrated to reproduce properties measured by experiments or simulations. The main contribution of this paper is an approximate Bayesian framework for the calibration and uncertainty quantification of the force-field parameters, without assuming parameter uncertainty to be Gaussian. To this aim, since the likelihood function of the MD simulation models are intractable in absence of Gaussianity assumption, we use a likelihood-free inference scheme known as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and propose an adaptive population Monte Carlo ABC algorithm, which is illustrated to converge faster and scales better than previously used ABCsubsim algorithm for calibration of force-field of a helium system. The second contribution is the adaptation of ABC algorithms for High Performance Computing to MD simulation within the Python ecosystem ABCpy. We illustrate the performance of the developed methodology to learn posterior distribution and Bayesian estimates of Lennard-Jones force-field parameters of helium and TIP4P system of water implemented both for simulated and experimental datasets collected using Neutron and X-ray diffraction. For simulated data, the Bayesian estimate is in close agreement with the true parameter value used to generate the dataset. For experimental as well as for simulated data, the Bayesian posterior distribution shows a strong correlation pattern between the force-field parameters. Providing an estimate of the entire posterior distribution, our methodology also allows us to perform uncertainty quantification of model prediction.

In this work, we explore an active-learning strategy based on linear regression and able to predict the model's uncertainty on predictions for molecular configurations not sampled by the training set, thus providing a straightforward recipe for the extension of the latter.

Specifically, considering the spectral graph convolution as a construction operation towards target output, we prove that existing popular convolution paradigms cannot construct the target output with mild conditions on input graph signals, causing spectral GNNs to fall into suboptimal solutions. To address the issues, we rethink the spectral graph convolution from a more general two-dimensional (2-D) signal convolution perspective and propose a new convolution paradigm, named 2-D graph convolution. We prove that 2-D graph convolution unifies existing graph convolution paradigms, and is capable to construct arbitrary target output.

The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc can be obtained. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M0 and the initial accretion timescale tacc,0, the slope of the Md-Macc correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of log(Md/Macc) valid when the spread of tacc is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M0 and tacc,0, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the Md-Macc correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the Md-Macc correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07227v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350793, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7cf0cd1d-c5cf-4cb8-9a3f-aaea4e03e491\", \"authors\": [\"Matheus Sim\\u00e3o\", \"Fabiano Prado\", \"Omar Abdul Wahab\", \"Anderson Avila\"], \"title\": \"TempCharBERT: Keystroke Dynamics for Continuous Access Control Based on Pre-trained Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"With the widespread of digital environments, reliable authentication and continuous access control has become crucial. It can minimize cyber attacks and prevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular interest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of recognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this work, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize such patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP benchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization. BERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot be directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to recognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords and character-level information and can be an alternative solution. Notwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD as they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information (e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose TempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information in the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for the purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a significant improvement with this customization. We also showed the feasibility of training TempCharBERT on a federated learning settings in order to foster data privacy.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07224v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350657, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ee1d7cd7-a80e-48ca-a7a0-40221384c38f\", \"authors\": [\"Yunhao Luo\", \"Yilun Du\"], \"title\": \"Grounding Video Models to Actions through Goal Conditioned Exploration\", \"abstract\": \"Large video models, pretrained on massive amounts of Internet video, provide a rich source of physical knowledge about the dynamics and motions of objects and tasks. However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation.

We implement the corresponding filter design in a SNAIL-based JPA and demonstrate more than three orders of magnitude improvement in both power efficiency and pump leakage suppression compared to a similar device with regular capacitive coupling, while maintaining state-of-the-art dynamic range and near-quantum-limited noise performance.

It can advance research in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and animation, leading to practical applications in fields like entertainment, education, and telecommunication.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in capturing the diverse range of facial expressions, body motions, and hand motions accurately from a monocular video. Limited diversity in the video and the absence of 3D observations create difficulties in drivability with novel expressions and poses, leading to noticeable artifacts.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious 3D human avatars have focused on body motions without facial expressions and hand poses, lacking the ability to animate them realistically. The complexity of combining facial expressions, body motions, and hand motions in a single model, along with the need for accurate 3D observations, has hindered previous solutions.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a hybrid representation of surface mesh and 3D Gaussians in the 3D human avatar model. By treating each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface with pre-defined connectivity, we aim to overcome the limitations of existing volumetric avatars. The expected outcome is an expressive and animatable 3D human avatar that accurately represents facial expressions, body motions, and hand poses for enhanced non-verbal communication.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 514ca3f6-a61b-4738-8bfd-e69ff10107ce \nFrom agent5 to agent1: I am collaborating with you to generate a new research idea based on a provided introduction about modeling facial expressions, body motions, and hand motions for non-verbal communication.

In our study, the formation timescales of viscous disk evolution and planetesimal formation are linked to the formation of planetary embryos in the terrestrial planet zone. We connect a one dimensional model for viscous gas evolution, dust and pebble dynamics and pebble flux regulated planetesimal formation to the N-body code LIPAD. Our framework enables us to study the formation, growth, fragmentation and evolution of planetesimals with an initial size of 100km in diameter for the first million years of a viscous disk. Our study shows the effect of the planetesimal surface density evolution on the preferential location and timescales of planetary embryo formation. A one dimensional analytically derived model for embryo formation based on the local planetesimal surface density evolution is presented. This model manages to reproduce the spatial distribution, formation rate and total number of planetary embryos at a fraction of the computational cost of the N-body simulations. The formation of planetary embryos in the terrestrial planet zone occurs simultaneously to the formation of planetesimals. The local planetesimal surface density evolution and the orbital spacing of planetary embryos in the oligarchic regime serve well as constraints to model planetary embryo formation analytically.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nAnomalous sound detection (ASD) aims to detect anomalies from acoustic signals. Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection.

This task is typically approached as an unsupervised learning or novelty detection problem, given the complexities associated with the acquisition of comprehensive anomalous acoustic data. Conventional methodologies for training anomalous sound detection systems primarily employ auto-encoder architectures or representational learning with auxiliary tasks. However, both approaches have inherent limitations. Auto-encoder structures are constrained to utilizing only the target machine's operational sounds, while training with auxiliary tasks, although capable of incorporating diverse acoustic inputs, may yield representations that lack correlation with the characteristic acoustic signatures of anomalous conditions. We propose a training method based on the source separation model (CMGAN) that aims to isolate non-target machine sounds from a mixture of target and non-target class acoustic signals. This approach enables the effective utilization of diverse machine sounds and facilitates the training of complex neural network architectures with limited sample sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields better performance compared to both conventional auto-encoder training approaches and source separation techniques that focus on isolating target machine signals. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits the potential for enhanced representation learning as the quantity of non-target data increases, even while maintaining a constant volume of target class data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21797v1\", \"timestamp\": 1730185548, \"domain\": \"eess.AS\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"626b7270-ad2a-4c3a-bf85-8c200cd81e31\", \"authors\": [\"Yuma Koizumi\", \"Shoichiro Saito\", \"Hisashi Uematsu\", \"Noboru Harada\", \"Keisuke Imoto\"], \"title\": \"ToyADMOS: A Dataset of Miniature-Machine Operating Sounds for Anomalous Sound Detection\", \"abstract\": \"This paper introduces a new dataset called \\\"ToyADMOS\\\" designed for anomaly detection in machine operating sounds (ADMOS).

To build a large-scale dataset for ADMOS, we collected anomalous operating sounds of miniature machines (toys) by deliberately damaging them.

In this paper, we present a new dataset of industrial machine sounds that we call a sound dataset for malfunctioning industrial machine investigation and inspection (MIMII dataset).

However, existing sound difference captioning methods require anomalous sounds for training, which is impractical in typical machine condition monitoring settings where such sounds are unavailable. To solve this issue, we propose a new strategy for explaining anomalous differences that does not require anomalous sounds for training. Specifically, we introduce a framework that explains differences in predefined timbre attributes instead of using free-form text captions. Objective metrics of timbre attributes can be computed using timbral models developed through psycho-acoustical research, enabling the estimation of how and what timbre attributes have changed from normal sounds without training machine learning models. Additionally, to accurately determine timbre differences regardless of variations in normal training data, we developed a method that jointly conducts anomalous sound detection and timbre difference estimation based on a k-nearest neighbors method in an audio embedding space. Evaluation using the MIMII DG dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22033v1\", \"timestamp\": 1730208635, \"domain\": \"eess.AS\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"38815409-ce63-42f1-9d6b-3843e3d6fc9e\", \"authors\": [\"Jian Guan\", \"Feiyang Xiao\", \"Youde Liu\", \"Qiaoxi Zhu\", \"Wenwu Wang\"], \"title\": \"Anomalous Sound Detection using Audio Representation with Machine ID based Contrastive Learning Pretraining\", \"abstract\": \"Existing contrastive learning methods for anomalous sound detection refine the audio representation of each audio sample by using the contrast between the samples' augmentations (e.g., with time or frequency masking).

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nAutomatic speaker verification (ASV) systems have become in-\ncreasingly important in the field of voice recognition technol-\nogy including their applications in security systems, banking,\ncall centers, law enforcement, fraud prevention, criminal inves-\ntigations, and healthcare. Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\nto analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n\u2022 Unlike most prior studies that have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n\u2022 Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand the impact of ageing across the gender.\n\u2022 As opposed to the previous studies that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\nThe ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores.

Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset.

Speaker verification is done by the use of some parameters (features) from the speakers voice which can be used to differentiate among many speakers. The efficiency of speaker verification system mainly depends on the feature set providing high inter-speaker variability and low intra-speaker variability. There are many methods used for speaker verification. Some systems use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features (MFCCs), while others use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based speaker recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM), GMMs . In this paper simple intra-pitch temporal information in conjunction with pitch synchronous cepstral coefficients forms the feature set. The distinct feature of a speaker is determined from the steady state part of five cardinal spoken English vowels. The performance was found to be average when these features were used independently. But very encouraging results were observed when both features were combined to form a decision for speaker verification.

Advanced speaker verification systems, which leverage deep-learning approaches to extract speaker representations, have been successfully applied to a range of native speaker verification tasks. These systems are explored for non-native spoken English data in this paper.

Performance of systems trained on relatively limited amounts of BULATS data, and standard large speaker verification corpora, is compared.

It can prevent malicious actors from deceiving the system by manipulating speech signals. Addressing this issue can lead to advancements in speaker verification technology and contribute to the development of more secure systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in accurately inferring the identity of the source speaker from voice-converted speech data.

Technical obstacles include the need for robust algorithms that can effectively identify source speakers in various scenarios.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on discriminating between bona fide and spoofed speech for speaker verification systems, rather than specifically addressing source speaker identification in voice conversion attacks.

Synthesizer is trained using both audio and transcriptions that generate Mel spectrogram from a text and vocoder which converts the generated Mel Spectrogram into corresponding audio signal. Then the audio signal is processed by a noise reduction algorithm to eliminate unwanted noise and enhance speech clarity. The performance of synthesized speech from seen and unseen speakers are then evaluated using subjective and objective evaluation such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Gross Pitch Error (GPE), and Spectral distortion (SD).

This package aims to generate synthetic speech that sounds like the natural voice of an individual, but it does not replace the natural human voice. The architecture of the system comprises a speaker verification system, a synthesizer, a vocoder, and noise reduction. Speaker verification system trained on a varied set of speakers to achieve optimal generalization performance without relying on transcriptions. Synthesizer is trained using both audio and transcriptions that generate Mel spectrogram from a text and vocoder which converts the generated Mel Spectrogram into corresponding audio signal. Then the audio signal is processed by a noise reduction algorithm to eliminate unwanted noise and enhance speech clarity. The performance of synthesized speech from seen and unseen speakers are then evaluated using subjective and objective evaluation such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Gross Pitch Error (GPE), and Spectral distortion (SD).

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nGraph Structure Learning (GSL) is a burgeoning field of research that strives to unveil the underlying patterns and relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Jin et\u00a0al. (2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Aurora is a 1.3 billion parameter foundation model for high-resolution forecasting of weather and atmospheric processes. Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b].

The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere. Aurora can produce forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric forecasting problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events. We demonstrate this ability by producing operational forecasts for global air pollution and global high-resolution medium-term weather patterns that match or outperform state-of-the-art classical simulation tools, at orders of magnitude smaller computational cost.\nSpecifically, in under a minute, Aurora generates 5-day air pollution forecasts at 0.4\u2218superscript0.40.4^{\\circ}0.4 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT spatial resolution surpassing state-of-the-art resource-intensive atmospheric chemistry simulations on 74%percent7474\\%74 % of all targets; 10-day global weather forecasts at 0.1\u2218superscript0.10.1^{\\circ}0.1 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT resolution surpassing the state-of-the-art\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24087v1\", \"timestamp\": 1730391604, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6c765dbb-9106-4008-aa22-86a31f63fc22\", \"authors\": [\"Johannes Schneider\"], \"title\": \"Foundation models in brief: A historical, socio-technical focus\", \"abstract\": \"Foundation models can be disruptive for future AI development by scaling up deep learning in terms of model size and training data's breadth and size.

Understanding the Suitability for Pixel-Level Classification Using Multispectral Imagery\", \"abstract\": \"Foundation models, i.e., very large deep learning models, have demonstrated impressive performances in various language and vision tasks that are otherwise difficult to reach using smaller-size models. The major success of GPT-type of language models is particularly exciting and raises expectations on the potential of foundation models in other domains including satellite remote sensing. In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation models to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include Prithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an important question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for different remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance the understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for pixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution, through comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size deep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios traditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to foundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for classification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising results for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar), while the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning models is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability of foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised learning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked autoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing problems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11797v1\", \"timestamp\": 1713396648, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7ccea9b4-a873-4568-a2fd-91e56cddccec\", \"authors\": [\"Kaiyu Li\", \"Xiangyong Cao\", \"Deyu Meng\"], \"title\": \"A New Learning Paradigm for Foundation Model-based Remote Sensing Change Detection\", \"abstract\": \"Change detection (CD) is a critical task to observe and analyze dynamic processes of land cover. Although numerous deep learning-based CD models have performed excellently, their further performance improvements are constrained by the limited knowledge extracted from the given labelled data. On the other hand, the foundation models that emerged recently contain a huge amount of knowledge by scaling up across data modalities and proxy tasks. In this paper, we propose a Bi-Temporal Adapter Network (BAN), which is a universal foundation model-based CD adaptation framework aiming to extract the knowledge of foundation models for CD. The proposed BAN contains three parts, i.e. frozen foundation model (e.g., CLIP), bi-temporal adapter branch (Bi-TAB), and bridging modules between them. Specifically, BAN extracts general features through a frozen foundation model, which are then selected, aligned, and injected into Bi-TAB via the bridging modules. Bi-TAB is designed as a model-agnostic concept to extract task/domain-specific features, which can be either an existing arbitrary CD model or some hand-crafted stacked blocks. Beyond current customized models, BAN is the first extensive attempt to adapt the foundation model to the CD task. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our BAN in improving the performance of existing CD methods (e.g., up to 4.08\\\\% IoU improvement) with only a few additional learnable parameters. More importantly, these successful practices show us the potential of foundation models for remote sensing CD.

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning, applying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult to learn only using random initialization.

This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the image may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce a deep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark Anything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\\\\times 256$ images.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350998, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"003cd6ae-5141-460a-8741-bbe49a7441e7\", \"authors\": [\"Harsh Rangwani\"], \"title\": \"Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data\", \"abstract\": \"The datasets used for Deep Neural Network training (e.g., ImageNet, MSCOCO, etc.) are often manually balanced across categories (classes) to facilitate learning of all the categories. This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f581b693-875b-489a-98b5-b99584574578\", \"authors\": [\"Matheus Sim\\u00e3o\", \"Fabiano Prado\", \"Omar Abdul Wahab\", \"Anderson Avila\"], \"title\": \"TempCharBERT: Keystroke Dynamics for Continuous Access Control Based on Pre-trained Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"With the widespread of digital environments, reliable authentication and continuous access control has become crucial. It can minimize cyber attacks and prevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular interest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of recognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this work, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize such patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP benchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization. BERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot be directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to recognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords and character-level information and can be an alternative solution. Notwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD as they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information (e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose TempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information in the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for the purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a significant improvement with this customization. We also showed the feasibility of training TempCharBERT on a federated learning settings in order to foster data privacy.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07224v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350657, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent4", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session 7285321c-405c-4564-b6b4-be83b25fe0f5\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session 7285321c-405c-4564-b6b4-be83b25fe0f5 \\nFrom agent4 to agent1: I am collaborating with agent1 to generate a new research idea based on the provided Introduction.

Autonomous cyber defenses therefore become essential to mitigate the risk of successful attacks and their damage, especially when the response time, effort and accuracy required in those defenses is impractical or impossible through defenses operated exclusively by humans. Autonomous agents have the potential to use ML with large amounts of data about known cyberattacks as input, in order to learn patterns and predict characteristics of future attacks. Moreover, learning from past and present attacks enable defenses to adapt to new threats that share characteristics with previous attacks. On the other hand, autonomous cyber defenses introduce risks of unintended harm. Actions arising from autonomous defense agents may have harmful consequences of functional, safety, security, ethical, or moral nature.

These agents, operating on critical network infrastructure, need to be robust and trustworthy to ensure defense against adaptive cyber-attackers and, simultaneously, provide explanations for their actions and network activity. However, learning-enabled components typically use models, such as deep neural networks, that are not transparent in their high-level decision-making leading to assurance challenges. Additionally, cyber-defense agents must execute complex long-term defense tasks in a reactive manner that involve coordination of multiple interdependent subtasks. Behavior trees are known to be successful in modelling interpretable, reactive, and modular agent policies with learning-enabled components. In this paper, we develop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior trees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber environment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The learning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks and deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a simulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and enhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture for evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the EBT-based agent is robust to adaptive cyber-attacks and provides high-level explanations for interpreting its decisions and actions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16383v1\", \"timestamp\": 1729533638, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d58065aa-e91d-4b33-81c1-f1b5420267f7\", \"authors\": [\"Li Li\", \"Jean-Pierre S.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION Neural networks are mathematical models that simulate the way neurons operate in the brain. The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning. In terms of depth improvement, there are neural networks represented by ResNet, Inception, and DenseNet; in terms of channel information utilization improvement, there are neural networks represented by SENet and ShuffleNet; in terms of attention improvement, there are neural networks\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7dfe3e39-34d3-4498-a12a-59cf06da2e92\", \"authors\": [\"Mohit Agarwal\", \"Mimi Sun\", \"Chaitanya Kamath\", \"Arbaaz Muslim\", \"Prithul Sarker\", \"Joydeep Paul\", \"Hector Yee\", \"Marcin Sieniek\", \"Kim Jablonski\", \"Yael Mayer\", \"David Fork\", \"Sheila de Guia\", \"Jamie McPike\", \"Adam Boulanger\", \"Tomer Shekel\", \"David Schottlander\", \"Yao Xiao\", \"Manjit Chakravarthy Manukonda\", \"Yun Liu\", \"Neslihan Bulut\", \"Sami Abu-el-haija\", \"Arno Eigenwillig\", \"Parth Kothari\", \"Bryan Perozzi\", \"Monica Bharel\", \"Von Nguyen\", \"Luke Barrington\", \"Niv Efron\", \"Yossi Matias\", \"Greg Corrado\", \"Krish Eswaran\", \"Shruthi Prabhakara\", \"Shravya Shetty\", \"Gautam Prasad\"], \"title\": \"General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model\", \"abstract\": \"Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

Therefore, keeping track of AoII requires the knowledge of both the source and estimation processes. In this paper, we consider a time-slotted pull-based remote estimation system under a sampling rate constraint where the information source is a general discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) process. Moreover, packet transmission times from the source to the monitor are non-zero which disallows the monitor to have perfect information on the actual AoII process at any time. Hence, for this pull-based system, we propose the monitor to maintain a sufficient statistic called {\\\\em belief} which stands for the joint distribution of the age and source processes to be obtained from the history of all observations. Using belief, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to be used at the monitor as opposed to existing martingale estimators in the literature.

It was shown that such systems behave like convex systems under various restrictedsettings, such as for two-level neural networks, and when learning is only restricted locally inthe so-called neural tangent kernel space around specialized initializations. However, there areno theoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks encountered inpractice. This paper solves this fundamental problem by investigating such overparameterizeddeep neural networks when fully trained. We generalize a new technique called neural feature repopulation, originally introduced in (Fang et al., 2019a) for two-level neural networks, to analyze deep neural networks. It is shown that under suitable representations, overparameterized deep neural networks are inherently convex, and when optimized, the system can learn effective features suitable for the underlying learning task under mild conditions. This new analysis is consistent with empirical observations that deep neural networks are capable of learning efficient feature representations. Therefore, the highly unexpected result of this paper can satisfactorily explain the practical success of deep neural networks.

However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a \\\"sweet spot\\\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.

We explore the complementary relationships among prevalent clinical modalities and outline three main fusion schemes for multimodal classification networks: input fusion, intermediate fusion (encompassing single-level fusion, hierarchical fusion, and attention-based fusion), and output fusion. By evaluating the performance of these fusion techniques, we provide insight into the suitability of different network architectures for various multimodal fusion scenarios and application domains.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep equilibrium (DEQ) method towards multimodal fusion via seeking a fixed point of the dynamic multimodal fusion process and modeling the feature correlations in an adaptive and recursive manner. This new way encodes the rich information within and across modalities thoroughly from low level to high level for efficacious downstream multimodal learning and is readily pluggable to various multimodal frameworks. Extensive experiments on BRCA, MM-IMDB, CMU-MOSI, SUN RGB-D, and VQA-v2 demonstrate the superiority of our DEQ fusion.

In particular, we develop, for the first time, a multimodal fusion network as a joint coding model, where each single node, layer, and pipeline is represented as a channel. The forward propagation is thus equal to the information transmission in the channels. Then, we can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the effect of different fusion approaches. We argue the optimal fusion architecture is related to the essential capacity and its allocation based on the source and channel. To test this multimodal fusion hypothesis, we progressively determine a series of multimodal models based on the proposed fusion methods and evaluate them on the KITTI and the A2D2 datasets. Our optimal fusion network achieves 85%+ lane line accuracy and 98.7%+ overall.

As rehabilitation moves outside the clinic, technology should automatically detect such behavior to provide similar support. Previous works have shown the feasibility of automatic protective behavior detection (PBD) within a specific activity. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep learning for PBD across activity types, using wearable motion capture and surface electromyography data collected from healthy participants and people with chronic pain. We approach the problem by continuously detecting protective behavior within an activity rather than estimating its overall presence. The best performance reaches mean F1 score of 0.82 with leave-one-subject-out cross validation. When protective behavior is modelled per activity type, performance is mean F1 score of 0.77 for bend-down, 0.81 for one-leg-stand, 0.72 for sit-to-stand, 0.83 for stand-to-sit, and 0.67 for reach-forward. This performance reaches excellent level of agreement with the average experts' rating performance suggesting potential for personalized chronic pain management at home. We analyze various parameters characterizing our approach to understand how the results could generalize to other PBD datasets and different levels of ground truth granularity.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08990v4\", \"timestamp\": 1551030644, \"domain\": \"cs.HC\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b881c697-d691-4d91-b0f2-66ec36a7e287\", \"authors\": [\"Katie Liszewski\", \"Timothy McDonley\"], \"title\": \"Understanding Tool Synthesis Behavior and Safe Finite State Machine Design\", \"abstract\": \"High-reliability design requires understanding synthesis tool behavior and best practices.

Advances in deep learning (DL) can enable the development of such intervention. Using the EmoPain MoCap dataset, we investigate how attention-based DL architectures can be used to improve the detection of protective behavior by capturing the most informative temporal and body configurational cues characterizing specific movements and the strategies used to perform them. We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture named BodyAttentionNet (BANet).

The approach addresses the variety of ways people execute a movement (including healthy people) independently of the type of movement analyzed.

Therefore, where those activities present difficulties for people with chronic pain, technology-enabled support should be delivered continuously and automatically adapted to activity type and occurrence of protective behavior. Hence, to facilitate ubiquitous CP management, it becomes critical to enable accurate PBD over continuous data. In this paper, we propose to integrate human activity recognition (HAR) with PBD via a novel hierarchical HAR-PBD architecture comprising graph-convolution and long short-term memory (GC-LSTM) networks, and alleviate class imbalances using a class-balanced focal categorical-cross-entropy (CFCC) loss.

\n\n1 Introduction\n\nDeep probabilistic State Space Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe

Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively.

For ex-\nample, in medical imaging, models trained on the data from one institution may\nnot generalize well to another institution with different imaging hardware. Sim-\nilarly, in battery capacity monitoring, models trained on lab-collected data may\nperform poorly under diverse operation environments. Obtaining the annotation\nfor the new domains, however, is often very costly or infeasible. To address this\n\u22c6Hanbing Liu, Jingge Wang, Xuan Zhang, and Yang Li are from the Shenzhen Key\nLaboratory of Ubiquitous Data Enabling, SIGS, Tsinghua University.arXiv:2402.16681v2  [cs.LG]  18 Mar 20242 Hanbing Liu et al.\nchallenge, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been proposed, lever-\naging the labeled data from the source domain to improve the performance of\nlearning models on the unlabeled target domain [5]. In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata. As a divergence measurement\nthat takes into account the geometry of the data distributions, Wasserstein dis-\ntance (w-distance) [15] plays an important role in deriving the generalization\nbound in domain adaptation, which implies\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata.

Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools.

To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation.

The first class is somewhat limited as it is constrained by the need to remove a certain number of connections from the model. The second class turns out to include substantial variation in the position of the shadow variable in the causal structure (vis-a-vis the mediator and outcome) and the corresponding implications for the model. In constructing the models, to improve plausibility, we pay close attention to allowing, where possible, dependencies due to unobserved causes of the missingness.

Addressing this challenge can lead to more robust and generalizable machine learning models, advancing knowledge in the field and enabling practical applications in diverse domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe problem is complex due to the significant domain shift between source and target domains, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches like UDA. The challenges include determining the transfer order of intermediate domains, mitigating cumulative errors, and overcoming the limitations of metadata in continuous adaptation. Naive approaches may fail to capture the underlying domain continuity and bridge the domain gap effectively.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has faced limitations in addressing the complexities of domain shift and adaptation, particularly in continuous adaptation processes.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nState-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4\u00a0(Achiam et\u00a0al. 2023), Gemini\u00a0(Team et\u00a0al. 2023), Llama-3\u00a0(Meta 2024), and Claude-3 Sonnet\u00a0(Anthropic 2024) achieve remarkable performance through pre-training on large amounts of internet texts and rigorous alignment process for safety enhancement.\nDespite the immense effort in safety research, LLMs are still vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks and can exhibit unwanted behaviors\u00a0(Shah et\u00a0al. 2023; Chao et\u00a0al. 2023; Zou et\u00a0al. 2023b; Jones et\u00a0al. 2023; Yuan et\u00a0al. 2024; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2024).\n\n\nMachine Unlearning\u00a0(Cao and Yang 2015; Chris Jay\u00a0Hoofnagle and Borgesius 2019; Bourtoule et\u00a0al. 2021; Nguyen et\u00a0al. 2022; Xu et\u00a0al. 2023; Liu et\u00a0al. 2024c) has emerged as a promising method for mitigating unforeseen risks in LLMs before deployment.\nLi et\u00a0al. (2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples.

However, these models struggle to generalize as they typically learn superficial mapping from source code to labels instead of understanding the root causes of code vulnerabilities, resulting in poor performance in real-world scenarios beyond the training instances. To tackle this challenge, we introduce VulLLM, a novel framework that integrates multi-task learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively mine deep-seated vulnerability features. Specifically, we construct two auxiliary tasks beyond the vulnerability detection task. First, we utilize the vulnerability patches to construct a vulnerability localization task. Second, based on the vulnerability features extracted from patches, we leverage GPT-4 to construct a vulnerability interpretation task. VulLLM innovatively augments vulnerability classification by leveraging generative LLMs to understand complex vulnerability patterns, thus compelling the model to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities rather than overfitting to spurious features of a single task. The experiments conducted on six large datasets demonstrate that VulLLM surpasses seven state-of-the-art models in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and robustness.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03718v1\", \"timestamp\": 1717644545, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"16cd0fbb-cff5-4434-ab13-b8948f841fdc\", \"authors\": [\"Di Cao\", \"Yong Liao\", \"Xiuwei Shang\"], \"title\": \"RealVul: Can We Detect Vulnerabilities in Web Applications with LLM?\", \"abstract\": \"The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential for software vulnerability detection.

In this paper, we present RealVul, the first LLM-based framework designed for PHP vulnerability detection, addressing these issues. By vulnerability candidate detection methods and employing techniques such as normalization, we can isolate potential vulnerability triggers while streamlining the code and eliminating unnecessary semantic information, enabling the model to better understand and learn from the generated vulnerability samples. We also address the issue of insufficient PHP vulnerability samples by improving data synthesis methods. To evaluate RealVul's performance, we conduct an extensive analysis using five distinct code LLMs on vulnerability data from 180 PHP projects.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nText-to-image generative models have witnessed significant advancements in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications.

Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17].

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset.

Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\\\\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models.

In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG, a unified generative pre-training framework for bidirectional image-text generation with transformer model.

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named as CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator. Specifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the image encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the unlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision representation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image tokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon an input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general text-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly outperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality while not compromising the text-image matching.

Technical obstacles include optimizing the model to generate diverse outputs while ensuring coherence and relevance to the input text.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence constraints, leading to underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences. The lack of exploration into diverse divergence constraints and their impact on output diversity has limited progress in this area. By proposing a novel approach that incorporates diverse divergence constraints, this research aims to fill this gap and improve upon existing methodologies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves integrating diverse divergence constraints into the alignment process of text-to-image models, specifically focusing on enhancing output diversity. The approach will be evaluated using a dataset of text prompts and corresponding generated images, measuring output diversity and quality metrics. The expected outcome is an improved text-to-image model that can generate a wider range of high-quality images aligned with human preferences.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 0589f309-ad9f-4561-92e5-74f59e200f83 \nFrom agent3 to agent1: Hello, I am agent3.

Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\\\\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generation.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06998v2\", \"timestamp\": 1665666534, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c585584b-4741-4a41-9da7-9063948bf91e\", \"authors\": [\"Han Zhang\", \"Weichong Yin\", \"Yewei Fang\", \"Lanxin Li\", \"Boqiang Duan\", \"Zhihua Wu\", \"Yu Sun\", \"Hao Tian\", \"Hua Wu\", \"Haifeng Wang\"], \"title\": \"ERNIE-ViLG: Unified Generative Pre-training for Bidirectional Vision-Language Generation\", \"abstract\": \"Conventional methods for the image-text generation tasks mainly tackle the naturally bidirectional generation tasks separately, focusing on designing task-specific frameworks to improve the quality and fidelity of the generated samples. Recently, Vision-Language Pre-training models have greatly improved the performance of the image-to-text generation tasks, but large-scale pre-training models for text-to-image synthesis task are still under-developed. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG, a unified generative pre-training framework for bidirectional image-text generation with transformer model. Based on the image quantization models, we formulate both image generation and text generation as autoregressive generative tasks conditioned on the text/image input. The bidirectional image-text generative modeling eases the semantic alignments across vision and language. For the text-to-image generation process, we further propose an end-to-end training method to jointly learn the visual sequence generator and the image reconstructor. To explore the landscape of large-scale pre-training for bidirectional text-image generation, we train a 10-billion parameter ERNIE-ViLG model on a large-scale dataset of 145 million (Chinese) image-text pairs which achieves state-of-the-art performance for both text-to-image and image-to-text tasks, obtaining an FID of 7.9 on MS-COCO for text-to-image synthesis and best results on COCO-CN and AIC-ICC for image captioning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15283v1\", \"timestamp\": 1640922813, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"128be4ad-60fe-4250-8988-47048d18bd28\", \"authors\": [\"Zihao Wang\", \"Wei Liu\", \"Qian He\", \"Xinglong Wu\", \"Zili Yi\"], \"title\": \"CLIP-GEN: Language-Free Training of a Text-to-Image Generator with CLIP\", \"abstract\": \"Training a text-to-image generator in the general domain (e.g., Dall.e, CogView) requires huge amounts of paired text-image data, which is too expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named as CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator. Specifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the image encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the unlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision representation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image tokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon an input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general text-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly outperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality while not compromising the text-image matching.

Second, inspired by how text-to-image models learn from web-scale text-image pairs, we explore a new pretraining strategy to generate image variations using a large collection of image pairs. Our diffusion model \\\\textit{Semantica} receives a random (encoded) image from a webpage as conditional input and denoises another noisy random image from the same webpage.

It can lead to more realistic and diverse image outputs, enhancing the overall quality of generated content. Addressing this issue can also have implications for various applications, such as improving user experience in content generation platforms and enhancing the capabilities of AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in defining an objective that accurately captures human preferences and aligning text-to-image models with these preferences. Existing methods face complexities in training separate reward models, stability issues in reinforcement learning pipelines, and constraints imposed by reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. Additionally, overfitting and reduced output diversity pose further challenges in aligning these models with human preferences.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on aligning text-to-image models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with limited exploration of other divergence constraints. The complexity of training separate reward models and the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence have hindered the effective alignment of these models with human preferences. By exploring diverse divergence constraints and addressing issues of overfitting and reduced output diversity, this problem can be approached from a new perspective.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves exploring the effects of diverse divergence constraints on generation diversity in text-to-image models. By incorporating innovative approaches that enhance output diversity and align models more effectively with human preferences, the expected outcome is to improve the overall quality and relevance of generated images. The approach will involve experimenting with different divergence constraints, evaluating the impact on output diversity, and potentially leading to advancements in the field of text-to-image generation.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 5c48bf6e-cb19-438f-937f-53c789516995 \nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hello, let's start our brainstorming session to formulate a new research proposal that builds upon our expertise in natural language processing (NLP) and linguistic typology.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings. In turn, a high-level controller, responsible for\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains.

Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9].

The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction.

Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length.

The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\\\\times 256$ images.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350998, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"cbb3fb54-9f47-43dd-b29c-7774f14e41ce\", \"authors\": [\"Harsh Rangwani\"], \"title\": \"Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data\", \"abstract\": \"The datasets used for Deep Neural Network training (e.g., ImageNet, MSCOCO, etc.) are often manually balanced across categories (classes) to facilitate learning of all the categories.

The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary.

Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis.

Such tasks require accurate control of fast movements and precise timing in the presence of imprecise state estimation of the flying ball and the robot. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in learning of complex control tasks from data. However, applying step-based RL to dynamic tasks on real systems is safety-critical as RL requires exploring and failing safely for millions of time steps in high-speed regimes. In this paper, we demonstrate that safe learning of table tennis using model-free Reinforcement Learning can be achieved by using robot arms driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). Softness and back-drivability properties of PAMs prevent the system from leaving the safe region of its state space. In this manner, RL empowers the robot to return and smash real balls with 5 m\\\\s and 12m\\\\s on average to a desired landing point. Our setup allows the agent to learn this safety-critical task (i) without safety constraints in the algorithm, (ii) while maximizing the speed of returned balls directly in the reward function (iii) using a stochastic policy that acts directly on the low-level controls of the real system and (iv) trains for thousands of trials (v) from scratch without any prior knowledge.

An accurate return therefore has to be found depending on a high-dimensional continuous state space. To make learning in few trials possible the method is embedded into our robot system.

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation.

This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

It seems appealing to govern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaborate pipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controller design. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which contains many vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g., typical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient, computationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent in robotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted in Koopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD models can be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots. In addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover the complete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design - when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in a second-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using only real-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardware experiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictive controllers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significant concerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlying geometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, some geometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for with large amounts of data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07192v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731348497, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent5": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": []}"}, {"agent6": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"b272a981-0e91-4816-a5b8-b8a30c960bca\", \"authors\": [\"Zecheng Zhang\", \"Christian Moya\", \"Lu Lu\", \"Guang Lin\", \"Hayden Schaeffer\"], \"title\": \"DeepONet as a Multi-Operator Extrapolation Model: Distributed Pretraining with Physics-Informed Fine-Tuning\", \"abstract\": \"We propose a novel fine-tuning method to achieve multi-operator learning through training a distributed neural operator with diverse function data and then zero-shot fine-tuning the neural network using physics-informed losses for downstream tasks.

Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents.

Introduction\n\nResearch on large language models (OpenAI, 2023) (LLMs) is expanding in scope and yielding significant scientific advancements rapidly. These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), BART (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022; Ni et\u00a0al., 2021; Pradeep et\u00a0al., 2023a).

On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios.

INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\u00a0(Krumm et\u00a0al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), news\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2018b) and e-commerce\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2020; Qin et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval.

As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\nIn contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing various feature interaction operators, such as product operators\u00a0(Qu et\u00a0al., 2016), convolutional operators\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2019a), and attention operators\u00a0(Xiao et\u00a0al., 2017).

Automated audio-based speaker diarization of entertainment media poses challenges due to the diverse acoustic conditions present in media content, be it background music, overlapping speakers, or sound effects. At the same time, speaking faces in the visual modality provide complementary information and not prone to the errors seen in the audio modality. In this paper, we address the problem of speaker diarization in TV shows using the active speaker faces.

In this paper, we solve this fixed number of speaker issue by a novel speaker-wise conditional inference method based on the probabilistic chain rule. In the proposed method, each speaker's speech activity is regarded as a single random variable, and is estimated sequentially conditioned on previously estimated other speakers' speech activities. Similar to other sequence-to-sequence models, the proposed method produces a variable number of speakers with a stop sequence condition. We evaluated the proposed method on multi-speaker audio recordings of a variable number of speakers.

Recently proposed end-to-end speaker diarization outperformed conventional clustering-based speaker diarization, but it has one drawback: it is less flexible in terms of the number of speakers. This paper proposes a method for encoder-decoder based attractor calculation (EDA), which first generates a flexible number of attractors from a speech embedding sequence. Then, the generated multiple attractors are multiplied by the speech embedding sequence to produce the same number of speaker activities. The speech embedding sequence is extracted using the conventional self-attentive end-to-end neural speaker diarization (SA-EEND) network. In a two-speaker condition, our method achieved a 2.69 % diarization error rate (DER) on simulated mixtures and a 8.07 % DER on the two-speaker subset of CALLHOME, while vanilla SA-EEND attained 4.56 % and 9.54 %, respectively.

Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's voice from a speech mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech segments by speaker, annotating `who spoke when'. Previous studies have typically treated the two tasks independently. In practical applications, it is more meaningful to have knowledge about `who spoke what and when', which is captured by the two tasks. The two tasks share a similar objective of disentangling speakers. Speaker extraction operates in the frequency domain, whereas diarization is in the temporal domain. It is logical to believe that speaker activities obtained from speaker diarization can benefit speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker activity detection than the speech mixture. In this paper, we propose a unified model called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED) to address output inconsistency and scenario mismatch issues. It is designed to manage speech mixture with varying overlap ratios and variable number of speakers. We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the competitive baselines for speaker extraction and diarization tasks on LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. We further validate the diarization performance on CALLHOME, a dataset based on real recordings, and experimental results indicate that our model surpasses recently proposed approaches.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10674v2\", \"timestamp\": 1695135391, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session b7fbccd4-13b7-43f7-9ab4-e76bdb1d99b0\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session b7fbccd4-13b7-43f7-9ab4-e76bdb1d99b0 \\nFrom agent2 to agent1: Hello, I am agent2.

However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, we observe that, on our recently presented dataset with 15-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibits significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved.

Debatts takes two speech prompts, one from the opposing side (i.e. opponent) and one from the speaker. The prompt from the opponent is supposed to provide debating style prosody, and the prompt from the speaker provides identity information.

The architecture of the classifier is inconsequen-\ntial; the key contribution lies in the concept-aware sampling\nprocedure, bridging object-centric representation learning\nand learning under subpopulation shifts.\nIntegrating Stages 1 and 2 introduces CoBalT (Concept Bal-\nancing Technique) tailored for robust classification.

However, typically only very few active molecules are known. Therefore, few-shot learning methods have the potential to improve the effectiveness of this critical phase of the drug discovery process. We introduce a new method for few-shot drug discovery. Its main idea is to enrich a molecule representation by knowledge about known context or reference molecules. Our novel concept for molecule representation enrichment is to associate molecules from both the support set and the query set with a large set of reference (context) molecules through a Modern Hopfield Network. Intuitively, this enrichment step is analogous to a human expert who would associate a given molecule with familiar molecules whose properties are known. The enrichment step reinforces and amplifies the covariance structure of the data, while simultaneously removing spurious correlations arising from the decoration of molecules. Our approach is compared with other few-shot methods for drug discovery on the FS-Mol benchmark dataset. On FS-Mol, our approach outperforms all compared methods and therefore sets a new state-of-the art for few-shot learning in drug discovery. An ablation study shows that the enrichment step of our method is the key to improve the predictive quality. In a domain shift experiment, we further demonstrate the robustness of our method.

However, finding relevant concepts is tedious, as representation spaces are high-dimensional and hard to navigate. Current approaches include hand-crafting concept datasets and then converting them to latent space directions; alternatively, the process can be automated by clustering the latent space.

The main challenge is that the unlabeled data contain instances that are not only from known categories of the labeled data but also from novel categories. This leads traditional novel category discovery (NCD) methods to be incapacitated for GCD, due to their assumption of unlabeled data are only from novel categories. One effective way for GCD is applying self-supervised learning to learn discriminate representation for unlabeled data. However, this manner largely ignores underlying relationships between instances of the same concepts (e.g., class, super-class, and sub-class), which results in inferior representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Conceptional Contrastive Learning (DCCL) framework, which can effectively improve clustering accuracy by alternately estimating underlying visual conceptions and learning conceptional representation. In addition, we design a dynamic conception generation and update mechanism, which is able to ensure consistent conception learning and thus further facilitate the optimization of DCCL.

This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset.

Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient.

The method will be evaluated on various datasets, and the expected outcomes include improved classification performance, reduced bias, and enhanced interpretability of the deep learning models.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": [], "total_milestones": 0, "agent_kpis": {}}], "planning_scores": [4, 5, 4], "communication_scores": [3, -1, 1], "token_usage": 114053, "agent_kpis": {"agent2": 1, "agent4": 2, "agent3": 1, "agent6": 1}, "total_milestones": 4, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7.

Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12.

Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning, applying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult to learn only using random initialization.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

It seems appealing to govern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaborate pipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controller design. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which contains many vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g., typical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient, computationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent in robotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted in Koopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD models can be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots. In addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover the complete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design - when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in a second-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using only real-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardware experiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictive controllers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significant concerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlying geometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, some geometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for with large amounts of data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07192v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731348497, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve data transmission efficiency in mobile multi-hop networks that connect edge devices to core servers, especially considering the variability in link qualities between wireless and wired segments?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for enhancing the performance and reliability of data transmission in mobile networks.

Addressing this issue can also pave the way for more efficient utilization of network resources and improved user experiences.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in developing a robust transmission scheme that can effectively handle the variability in link qualities between wireless and wired segments. Existing strategies like deep joint source-channel coding face limitations at the intersection of analog and digital methods, making it difficult to achieve optimal performance. The complexity of adapting to different link qualities and ensuring efficient data transmission poses technical and practical obstacles that need to be overcome.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has struggled to address the challenges of variability in link qualities and the need for a transmission scheme that transcends existing deep joint source-channel coding strategies.

The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9af7a22f-5324-4f73-9294-3c475fa9613d\", \"authors\": [\"Mohit Agarwal\", \"Mimi Sun\", \"Chaitanya Kamath\", \"Arbaaz Muslim\", \"Prithul Sarker\", \"Joydeep Paul\", \"Hector Yee\", \"Marcin Sieniek\", \"Kim Jablonski\", \"Yael Mayer\", \"David Fork\", \"Sheila de Guia\", \"Jamie McPike\", \"Adam Boulanger\", \"Tomer Shekel\", \"David Schottlander\", \"Yao Xiao\", \"Manjit Chakravarthy Manukonda\", \"Yun Liu\", \"Neslihan Bulut\", \"Sami Abu-el-haija\", \"Arno Eigenwillig\", \"Parth Kothari\", \"Bryan Perozzi\", \"Monica Bharel\", \"Von Nguyen\", \"Luke Barrington\", \"Niv Efron\", \"Yossi Matias\", \"Greg Corrado\", \"Krish Eswaran\", \"Shruthi Prabhakara\", \"Shravya Shetty\", \"Gautam Prasad\"], \"title\": \"General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model\", \"abstract\": \"Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731349964, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7f3df213-8c2d-4848-918e-37a0edba8835\", \"authors\": [\"Mario Rosenfelder\", \"Lea Bold\", \"Hannes Eschmann\", \"Peter Eberhard\", \"Karl Worthmann\", \"Henrik Ebel\"], \"title\": \"Data-Driven Predictive Control of Nonholonomic Robots Based on a Bilinear Koopman Realization: Data Does Not Replace Geometry\", \"abstract\": \"Advances in machine learning and the growing trend towards effortless data generation in real-world systems has led to an increasing interest for data-inferred models and data-based control in robotics. It seems appealing to govern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaborate pipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controller design. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which contains many vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g., typical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient, computationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent in robotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted in Koopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD models can be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots. In addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover the complete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design - when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in a second-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using only real-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardware experiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictive controllers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significant concerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlying geometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, some geometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for with large amounts of data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07192v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731348497, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nWhat are the challenges in efficient data transmission across mobile multi-hop networks, and how can we develop a robust transmission scheme that overcomes the limitations of existing strategies?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving the problem of efficient data transmission in mobile multi-hop networks is crucial for improving connectivity and communication in various applications.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00210v1\", \"timestamp\": 1722472817, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6acb4457-310e-4bfd-a392-ce300cbb8a18\", \"authors\": [\"Siwei Tu\", \"Weidong Yang\", \"Ben Fei\"], \"title\": \"Taming Generative Diffusion for Universal Blind Image Restoration\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration.

To push the limits of plug-and-play image restoration, we propose a novel framework with blind Gaussian prior, which can deal with more complicated image restoration problems in the real world. More specifically, we build up a new image restoration model by regarding the noise level as a variable, which is implemented by a two-stage blind Gaussian denoiser consisting of a noise estimation subnetwork and a denoising subnetwork, where the noise estimation subnetwork provides the noise level to the denoising subnetwork for blind noise removal. We also introduce the curvature map into the encoder-decoder architecture and the supervised attention module to achieve a highly flexible and effective convolutional neural network.

Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00210v1\", \"timestamp\": 1722472817, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"848200e1-b4ba-46fd-834a-35e0326054a2\", \"authors\": [\"Siwei Tu\", \"Weidong Yang\", \"Ben Fei\"], \"title\": \"Taming Generative Diffusion for Universal Blind Image Restoration\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration.

Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter.

However, existing plug-and-play image restoration methods are designed for non-blind Gaussian denoising such as zhang et al (2022), the performance of which visibly deteriorate for unknown noises. To push the limits of plug-and-play image restoration, we propose a novel framework with blind Gaussian prior, which can deal with more complicated image restoration problems in the real world. More specifically, we build up a new image restoration model by regarding the noise level as a variable, which is implemented by a two-stage blind Gaussian denoiser consisting of a noise estimation subnetwork and a denoising subnetwork, where the noise estimation subnetwork provides the noise level to the denoising subnetwork for blind noise removal. We also introduce the curvature map into the encoder-decoder architecture and the supervised attention module to achieve a highly flexible and effective convolutional neural network. The experimental results on image denoising, deblurring and single-image super-resolution are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our deep curvature denoiser and the resulting plug-and-play blind image restoration method over the state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nGeneral policies are policies that can be used to solve a collection of planning\nproblems\nreactively\u00a0Srivastava et al. (2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort.

Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures.

The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components through pretraining. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks.

Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stress the importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately. Finally, we emphasise the need for larger paired (scan and report) datasets alongside data augmentation to tackle overfitting seen in these large vision-language models.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08811v1\", \"timestamp\": 1720723159, \"domain\": \"eess.IV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d67727f5-5652-433b-9552-4aa04c5c13b2\", \"authors\": [\"Eliana Pastor\", \"Alkis Koudounas\", \"Giuseppe Attanasio\", \"Dirk Hovy\", \"Elena Baralis\"], \"title\": \"Explaining Speech Classification Models via Word-Level Audio Segments and Paralinguistic Features\", \"abstract\": \"Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) have provided new insights into how models for vision, language, and tabular data operate. However, few approaches exist for understanding speech models. Existing work focuses on a few spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, and explanations are difficult to interpret for most users. We introduce a new approach to explain speech classification models. We generate easy-to-interpret explanations via input perturbation on two information levels. 1) Word-level explanations reveal how each word-related audio segment impacts the outcome. 2) Paralinguistic features (e.g., prosody and background noise) answer the counterfactual: ``What would the model prediction be if we edited the audio signal in this way?'' We validate our approach by explaining two state-of-the-art SLU models on two speech classification tasks in English and Italian. Our findings demonstrate that the explanations are faithful to the model's inner workings and plausible to humans.

By analyzing the current state of research in this area and brainstorming potential research ideas, the proposed research idea could lead to advancements in AI tasks and improve specific capabilities such as coding, reasoning, and tool usage. This paper could have significant implications for the research community by providing insights into novel research directions and contributing to the broader field of Machine Learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem include the need to overcome technical obstacles related to training and inference efficiency, model stability, and the trade-offs in architecture design. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the complexity of developing foundation models that can effectively support a wide range of AI tasks. Additionally, the understanding of scaling laws and the optimization of training compute for inference efficiency present practical obstacles that need to be addressed.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research in foundation models has faced limitations in terms of model performance, parameter efficiency, and scalability. The development of large models like Llama 3 has improved upon earlier models by leveraging increased compute and improved data, leading to better understanding of scaling laws. The proposed approach differs from prior work by focusing on the development of smaller models that trade training compute for inference efficiency, as well as exploring alternative architectural designs to enhance model capacity.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves conducting a literature review, brainstorming research ideas, summarizing collective thoughts, and formulating a new research proposal following the '5q' format.

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

In this work, we generalize the discrete Differentiable Graph Module (dDGM) for latent graph learning. The original dDGM architecture used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static embedding space.

Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models.

The core of recommender system is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate, purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n(CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\nprediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6,19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user \u2014 more specifically, her one-hop neighbors \u2014 to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al. [ 39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network (GCN) [ 14,23], following the samearXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020propagation rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation, and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results of the 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n\u2022The best setting in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n\u2022The second best setting is using L1normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e., LightGCN- L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n\u2022Normalizing symmetrically on two sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness.

We speculate that such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN\u2019s effectiveness. To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU=MX\nu=1MX\nv=1cv\u2192u(eu\n||eu||2\u2212ev\n||ev||2)2, (17)\nwhere the L2norm on embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding\u2019s scale. Similarly we can obtained the\ndefinition for item embeddings. Table 6 shows the smoothness\nof two models, matrix factorization (i.e., using the E(0)for model\nprediction) and the 2-layer LightGCN-single (i.e., using the E(2)for\nprediction). Note that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is much lower\nthan that of MF.

In recommender systems, a field related to link recommendation, a number of diversification methods have been proposed to improve the diversity of recommended items. Nevertheless, diversity preference is distinct from diversity studied by diversification methods. To address these research gaps, we define and operationalize the concept of diversity preference for link recommendation and propose a new link recommendation problem: the diversity preference-aware link recommendation problem. We then analyze key properties of the new link recommendation problem and develop a novel link recommendation method to solve the problem. Using two large-scale online social network data sets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over representative diversification methods adapted for link recommendation as well as state-of-the-art link recommendation methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10689v2\", \"timestamp\": 1653173940, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve the effectiveness of recommender systems by leveraging deviation-based learning and addressing biases in job recommendations?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem can lead to more accurate and personalized recommendations for users, enhancing their overall experience.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2.

Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the \u201dnerfacto\u201d model implemented by Nerfstudio (Tancik et\u00a0al., 2023), which is a combination of modular features from multiple papers (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021; Barron et\u00a0al., 2022; M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et\u00a0al., 2021; Verbin et\u00a0al., 2022)\n, designed to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face.

Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs.

To this end, we take advantage of a generalizable NeRF model to facilitate style transfer in 3D, thereby enabling the use of a single learned model across various scenes.

Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13168v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700630675, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"36292062-c5d3-437b-a288-7a21fee7311e\", \"authors\": [\"Zijiang Yang\", \"Zhongwei Qiu\", \"Chang Xu\", \"Dongmei Fu\"], \"title\": \"MM-NeRF: Multimodal-Guided 3D Multi-Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Field\", \"abstract\": \"3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, and keeps multi-view consistency and style consistency between multimodal guidance.

Given a NeRF model reconstructed from a set of multi-view images, we perform 3D style transfer by refining the source NeRF model using stylized images generated by a style-aligned image-to-image diffusion model. Given a target style prompt, we first generate perceptually similar multi-view images by leveraging a depth-conditioned diffusion model with an attention-sharing mechanism.

To this end, we take advantage of a generalizable NeRF model to facilitate style transfer in 3D, thereby enabling the use of a single learned model across various scenes.

Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer.

This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample, recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1). Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning.

Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1. Our Contribution\nIn this section we summarize our main methods for simultaneously handling multiple instances of\na task than addressing them one by one. As an example, consider an n\u00d7nmatrix Aand the objective of\ncalculating its product with an input column vector x, where the computational resource Cis the number\nof arithmetic operations. For a single vector x, it is easy to see that \u0398(n2)operations are necessary and\nsufficient. However, if instead of one input vector x, there are ninput vectors x1, . . . , x nthen one can do\nbetter than n\u00d7\u0398(n2)\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Among interpretable models, rule lists are among the best-known and easily interpretable ones. However, finding optimal rule lists is computationally challenging, and current approaches are impractical for large datasets.   We present a novel and scalable approach to learn nearly optimal rule lists from large datasets. Our algorithm uses sampling to efficiently obtain an approximation of the optimal rule list with rigorous guarantees on the quality of the approximation. In particular, our algorithm guarantees to find a rule list with accuracy very close to the optimal rule list when a rule list with high accuracy exists. Our algorithm builds on the VC-dimension of rule lists, for which we prove novel upper and lower bounds. Our experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that our algorithm identifies nearly optimal rule lists with a speed-up up to two orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art exact approaches. Moreover, our algorithm is as fast as, and sometimes faster than, recent heuristic approaches, while reporting higher quality rule lists.

In fact, our learning-augmented skip list is still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant factor. We show that if the search queries follow the ubiquitous Zipfian distribution, then the expected search time for an item by our skip list is only a constant, independent of the total number $n$ of items, i.e., $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$, whereas a traditional skip list will have an expected search time of $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n)$. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structure achieves an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect.

While being able to bring reliable robustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity models, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained large models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a distillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to improved robustness: the use of robust soft labels -- predictions of a robust model. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness distillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD) to train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft labels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to guide the student's learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all loss terms.

It can lead to more accurate predictive models, better decision-making processes, and enhanced data analysis capabilities. Addressing this question could pave the way for new methodologies and applications in various industries.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of handling interrelated data spread across multiple linked tables in RDBs. Naive approaches may fail due to the lack of established benchmarks for evaluating predictive ML models in this domain. Technical obstacles include the need to account for relational information and network effects while preserving the original format of the data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating predictive models over RDB data. The existing solutions have focused either on graph learning problems or tabular model evaluations, but head-to-head comparisons on unfiltered RDB/multi-table data are insufficient. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by proposing a new methodology that combines the strengths of both branches.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a generic supervised learning formulation across inductive and transductive settings for dynamic RDBs.

The dataset will include raw data with billion-scale attributes, and the tasks will cover transductive, inductive, and temporal aspects.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             introduction of\nan algorithm for malware detection and classification based on\ntransformers [8]. The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information. The proposed approach\nachieves not only enhanced accuracy in identifying malicious\npayloads, but also pushes the boundaries of current methodolo-\ngies that help distinguish malicious payload types by employing\ntwo different classification heads.\nII. D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata. Similarly, we randomly select an equal number of benign\npayload entries as malicious entries to balance the final dataset.\nThe benign entries are labeled as 0.

The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload.

By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format.
