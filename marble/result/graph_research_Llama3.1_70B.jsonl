This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node classification.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15487v3\", \"timestamp\": 1679903623, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9c12de9a-904b-4382-ae64-7c4322444991\", \"authors\": [\"Zheyi Qin\", \"Randy Paffenroth\", \"Anura P.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and especially those algorithms that capture graph topology through message passing for neighborhood aggregation, have been a leading solution. However, these networks often require substantial computational resources and may not optimally leverage the information contained in the graph's topology, particularly for large-scale or complex graphs. We propose Topology Coordinate Neural Network (TCNN) and Directional Virtual Coordinate Neural Network (DVCNN) as novel and efficient alternatives to message passing GNNs, that directly leverage the graph's topology, sidestepping the computational challenges presented by competing algorithms. Our proposed methods can be viewed as a reprise of classic techniques for graph embedding for neural network feature engineering, but they are novel in that our embedding techniques leverage ideas in Graph Coordinates (GC) that are lacking in current practice. Experimental results, benchmarked against the Open Graph Benchmark Leaderboard, demonstrate that TCNN and DVCNN achieve competitive or superior performance to message passing GNNs.

However, the lack of interpretability and explainability in GNNs hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and finance. By developing a more interpretable and explainable GNN model, we can increase trust in these models and enable their wider adoption. This research can also advance knowledge in the field of graph machine learning and lead to practical applications in various domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping an interpretable and explainable GNN model is challenging due to the complex nature of graph-structured data and the non-linear transformations used in GNNs. Naive approaches, such as feature importance or saliency maps, may not be effective in capturing the complex relationships between nodes and edges in a graph. Additionally, the lack of a clear definition of interpretability and explainability in GNNs makes it difficult to develop a universally accepted evaluation metric. Technical obstacles, such as the need for efficient and scalable algorithms, also need to be overcome.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing GNN models that achieve high accuracy on various tasks, but interpretability and explainability have been largely overlooked. Existing methods for interpretability and explainability in GNNs are limited and often rely on simplifying assumptions or heuristics. For example, some methods focus on explaining the importance of individual nodes or edges, but neglect the complex relationships between them. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that integrates interpretability and explainability into the GNN architecture, rather than treating them as separate post-processing steps.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach, called Explainable Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs), consists of three key components:\n\n1. **Graph Attention Mechanism**: We propose a novel graph attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific nodes and edges when making predictions.\n2. **Interpretability Module**: We develop an interpretability module that provides insights into the decision-making process of the model by highlighting the most important nodes and edges.\n3. **Explainability Framework**: We propose a framework for evaluating the explainability of GNN models, which includes metrics for evaluating the accuracy and fidelity of the explanations.\n\nWe evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including social networks, biological networks, and chemical networks.

Such a representation works nicely with\nalgebraic manipulations. Here we introduce a sim-\nple method to augment an attributed graph with a\nvirtual node that is bidirectionally connected to all\nexisting nodes. The virtual node represents the la-\ntent aspects of the graph, which are not immediately\navailable from the attributes and local connectivity\nstructures. The expanded graph is then put through\nany node representation method. The representation\nof the virtual node is then the representation of the\nentire graph. In this paper, we use the recently in-\ntroduced Column Network for the expanded graph,\nresulting in a new end-to-end graph classi\ufb01cation\nmodel dubbed Virtual Column Network (VCN). The\nmodel is validated on two tasks: (i) predicting bio-\nactivity of chemical compounds, and (ii) \ufb01nding\nsoftware vulnerability from source code.Results\nFig. 3 reports the performance on Code classi\ufb01cation task in\nAUC and F1-score. VCN outperforms all the baselines on\nboth measures.\n4results in a new graph classi\ufb01cation method called\nVirtual Column Network (VCN). We demonstrate the power\nof the VCN on two tasks: (i) classi\ufb01cation of bio-activity of\nchemical compounds against a given cancer; (ii) detecting soft-\nware vulnerability from source code. Overall, the automatic\nrepresentation learning is more powerful than state-of-the art\nfeature engineering.\nThere are rooms open for further investigations. First, we\ncan use multiple virtual nodes instead of just one.The graph\nis then embedded into a matrix whose columns are vector\nrepresentation of virtual nodes. This will be bene\ufb01cial in sev-\neral ways. For multitask learning, each virtual node will be\nused for a task and all tasks share the same node represen-\ntations. For big graphs with tight subgraph structures, each\nvirtual node can target a subgraph.

Notably, applying node-level GSL to graph classification is non-trivial due to the lack of find-grained guidance for intricate structure learning. Inspired by the vital role of subgraph in graph classification, in this paper we explore the potential of subgraph structure learning for graph classification by tackling the challenges of key subgraph selection and structure optimization. We propose a novel Motif-driven Subgraph Structure Learning method for Graph Classification (MOSGSL).

Existing methods are either tailored for non-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalanced node classification while few focus on imbalanced graph classification. To this end, we introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN), which alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision globally from neighboring graphs and locally from stochastic augmentations of graphs.

Firstly, Carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) classification can help people to understand the properties of enzymes. However, one CAZyme may belong to several classes. This leads to Multi-label CAZyme classification. Secondly, to capture information from the secondary structure of protein, protein classification is modeled as graph classification problem. Thirdly, compound-protein interactions prediction employs graph learning for compound with sequential embedding for protein. This can be seen as classification task for compound-protein pairs. This paper proposes three models for protein classification. Firstly, this paper proposes a Multi-label CAZyme classification model using CNN-LSTM with Attention mechanism. Secondly, this paper proposes a variational graph autoencoder based subspace learning model for protein graph classification. Thirdly, this paper proposes graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and Attention-based CNN-LSTM for compound-protein interactions prediction, as well as comparing GIN with graph convolution networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in this task.

Despite the proposal of numerous GSL methods, the progresses in this field mostly concentrated on node-level tasks, while graph-level tasks (e.g., graph classification) remain largely unexplored. Notably, applying node-level GSL to graph classification is non-trivial due to the lack of find-grained guidance for intricate structure learning. Inspired by the vital role of subgraph in graph classification, in this paper we explore the potential of subgraph structure learning for graph classification by tackling the challenges of key subgraph selection and structure optimization. We propose a novel Motif-driven Subgraph Structure Learning method for Graph Classification (MOSGSL). Specifically, MOSGSL incorporates a subgraph structure learning module which can adaptively select important subgraphs. A motif-driven structure guidance module is further introduced to capture key subgraph-level structural patterns (motifs) and facilitate personalized structure learning.

However, most existing graph classification problems with GNNs follow the protocol of balanced data splitting, which misaligns with many real-world scenarios in which some classes have much fewer labels than others. Directly training GNNs under this imbalanced scenario may lead to uninformative representations of graphs in minority classes, and compromise the overall classification performance, which signifies the importance of developing effective GNNs towards handling imbalanced graph classification. Existing methods are either tailored for non-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalanced node classification while few focus on imbalanced graph classification. To this end, we introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN), which alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision globally from neighboring graphs and locally from stochastic augmentations of graphs. Globally, we construct a graph of graphs (GoG) based on kernel similarity and perform GoG propagation to aggregate neighboring graph representations. Locally, we employ topological augmentation via masking node features or dropping edges with self-consistency regularization to generate stochastic augmentations of each graph that improve the model generalibility.

However, most existing graph classification models are designed for balanced data and may not perform well on imbalanced datasets. Developing an effective model for imbalanced graph classification can advance knowledge in this area and lead to practical applications, such as improving the accuracy of drug classification and toxicity detection. This paper can also affect future research by providing a new framework for handling imbalanced graph classification tasks and inspiring further research in this area.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nSolving this problem is challenging because imbalanced graph classification tasks involve graphs with different sizes, structures, and properties, making it difficult to develop a unified model that can handle all types of graphs. Additionally, existing graph neural networks may not be effective in handling imbalanced data, and naive approaches such as oversampling or undersampling may not work well for graph data. Furthermore, graph data has a complex structure, and it is challenging to design a model that can effectively capture the relationships between nodes and edges. Technical obstacles include designing a model that can handle different types of graphs, developing effective methods for data augmentation and oversampling, and selecting the right evaluation metrics.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing graph neural networks for balanced graph classification tasks, and there is a lack of research on imbalanced graph classification. Existing methods for handling imbalanced data, such as oversampling and undersampling, are not effective for graph data, and there is a need for new methods that can handle the complex structure of graph data. Additionally, previous research has focused on developing models for specific types of graphs, and there is a need for a unified model that can handle different types of graphs. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a new framework for handling imbalanced graph classification tasks, which includes a novel data augmentation method and a new evaluation metric.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology includes the following key components:\n\n* A novel data augmentation method that generates new graphs by applying random mapping, vertex-similarity mapping, motif-random mapping, and motif-similarity mapping to the original graphs.\n* A new evaluation metric that measures the performance of the model on imbalanced graph classification tasks.\n* A unified model that can handle different types of graphs, including graphs with different sizes, structures, and properties.\n* A comparison of our model with existing graph neural networks and other methods for handling imbalanced data.\n\nWe expect the following outcomes:\n\n* Our model will outperform existing graph neural networks and other methods for handling imbalanced data on imbalanced graph classification tasks.\n* Our model will be able to handle different types of graphs and improve the performance of existing graph neural networks.\n* Our novel data augmentation method will be effective in generating new graphs that can improve the performance of the model.\n* Our new evaluation metric will be effective in measuring the performance of the model on imbalanced graph classification tasks.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": ["In Session 68485801-102f-41e7-ac91-9b39686a87de \nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hello, I am agent1.

Can you help me with the literature review and brainstorming?\nFrom agent2 to agent1: Hello agent1, I\\u2019d be happy to collaborate with you on a new research idea based on the provided Introduction. To begin, let\\u2019s conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area. The Introduction discusses the concept of learning representation for graph classification, which involves turning a variable-size graph into a fixed-size vector or matrix. This is achieved by augmenting an attributed graph with a virtual node that is bidirectionally connected to all existing nodes, representing the latent aspects of the graph. The expanded graph is then put through any node representation method, and the representation of the virtual node is used as the representation of the entire graph. The authors propose a new end-to-end graph classification model called Virtual Column Network (VCN), which is validated on two tasks: predicting bioactivity of chemical compounds and finding software vulnerability from source code. The results show that VCN outperforms all baselines on both measures. Now, let\\u2019s brainstorm some potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction. What are your thoughts?\nFrom agent1 to agent2: I think we should explore the idea of using multiple virtual nodes instead of just one, as mentioned in the Introduction. This could potentially lead to better representation learning for graphs with complex structures. We could also investigate the use of different node representation methods, such as Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network or Graph Neural Network, to see if they can improve the performance of the Virtual Column Network. Additionally, it might be interesting to apply the Virtual Column Network to other tasks, such as traffic prediction or recommender systems, to see if it can achieve similar results.

Nu-\nmerous studies elaborating the stability of materials and\nthe mobility of ions have been conducted using theoret-\nical calculations because these aspects are directly re-\nlated to device performance. To further advance our\nunderstanding of the operating mechanisms of such ion-\nconducting devices, atomic-scale analyses of ionic motion\nin device operating circumstances, that is, under electric\nfields, are crucial.\nAssuming a linear response, external forces arising\nfrom applied electric fields can be estimated simply by\nmultiplying the electric field vector by the valence states\nof the ions. In electronic state calculations, such as den-\nsity functional theory (DFT) calculations, the valence\nstates are often evaluated, for instance, using Mulliken\ncharges from the coefficients of atomic orbitals [4] or\nBader charges using charge density distributions [5]. By\ncontrast, the Born effective charges are defined from the\ninduced polarisation in a periodic system by their atomic\ndisplacements (see Fig. 1(a)), or are equivalently de-\nfined from the induced atomic forces with respect to the\napplied electric fields. As our current interest lies in\nanalysing ion motion under applied electric fields, and the\nlatter definition precisely corresponds to the target situ-\nation, Born effective charges, rather than static valence\n\u2217shimizu@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\u2020watanabe@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jpstates, are the suitable physical quantities to evaluate the\nexternal forces acting on the ions. In addition, the Born\neffective charges can be quantified as the number of each\natom without the arbitrariness of the decomposition of\nthe total charges. In most cases, these per-atom quanti-\nties are compatible with the computational processes of\ndynamic calculations using the methods include the high-dimensional neural network po-\ntential (NNP) [6], Gaussian approximation potential [7],\nmoment tensor potential [8], and spectral neighbour anal-\nysis potential [9]. Numerous studies have demonstrated\nthat ML potentials optimised using DFT calculation data\ncan predict various physical quantities comparable to\nthose of DFT calculations at low computational costs\n[10\u201313].

In order to accelerate the discovery of new superionic conductors is convenient to establish meaningful relations between ionic transport and simple materials descriptors. Recently, several experimental studies on lithium fast-ion conductors have suggested a correlation between lattice softness and enhanced ionic conductivity due to a concomitant decrease in the activation energy for ion migration, $E_{a}$. In this article, we employ extensive \\\\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory to substantiate the links between ionic transport and lattice dynamics in a number of structurally and chemically distinct lithium superionic conductors. Our first-principles results show no evidence for a direct and general correlation between $E_{a}$, or the hopping attempt frequency, and lattice softness.

Hence, lattice softness can be identified with enhanced lithium diffusivity but only within families of superionic materials presenting very similar migration activation energies, due to larger $D_{0}$.

It is an effective way to create a smooth energy potential landscape and construct local pathways for lithium ion migration. By adjusting the spacing and arrangement of the isolated anions, these local pathways can connect with each other, leading to high ion conductivity. By designing different space groups and local environments of the Se2- anions in the Li8SiSe6 composition, combined with the ion transport properties obtained from AIMD simulations, we define isolated anions and find that local environment with higher point group symmetry promotes the formation of cage-like local transport channels. Additionally, the appropriate distance between neighboring isolated anions can create coplanar connections between adjacent cage-like channels. Furthermore, different types of isolated anions can be used to control the distribution of cage-like channels in the lattice. Based on the structural characteristic of isolated anions, we discovered compounds with isolated N3-, Cl-, I-, and S2- features from the crystal structure databases.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \nIntroduction\n\nImprovements in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education have accelerated the shift from teaching and assessing facts to developing students\u2019 conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills (NGSS 2013). To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et\u00a0al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\u00a0al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016).

Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages.   Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.   In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools' performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders.

This paper introduces CAELF, a Contestable AI Empowered LLM Framework for automating interactive feedback. CAELF allows students to query, challenge, and clarify their feedback by integrating a multi-agent system with computational argumentation. Essays are first assessed by multiple Teaching-Assistant Agents (TA Agents), and then a Teacher Agent aggregates the evaluations through formal reasoning to generate feedback and grades. Students can further engage with the feedback to refine their understanding. A case study on 500 critical thinking essays with user studies demonstrates that CAELF significantly improves interactive feedback, enhancing the reasoning and interaction capabilities of LLMs. This approach offers a promising solution to overcoming the time and resource barriers that have limited the adoption of interactive feedback in educational settings.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07453v1\", \"timestamp\": 1726077541, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"191cc90c-411e-4d56-8697-3e9f8fd51303\", \"authors\": [\"Giuseppe Mignemi\", \"Yunxiao Chen\", \"Irini Moustaki\"], \"title\": \"Unfolding the Network of Peer Grades: A Latent Variable Approach\", \"abstract\": \"Peer grading is an educational system in which students assess each other's work. It is commonly applied under Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and offline classroom settings. With this system, instructors receive a reduced grading workload, and students enhance their understanding of course materials by grading others' work. Peer grading data have a complex dependence structure, for which all the peer grades may be dependent. This complex dependence structure is due to a network structure of peer grading, where each student can be viewed as a vertex of the network, and each peer grade serves as an edge connecting one student as a grader to another student as an examinee. This paper introduces a latent variable model framework for analyzing peer grading data and develops a fully Bayesian procedure for its statistical inference. This framework has several advantages. First, when aggregating multiple peer grades, the average score and other simple summary statistics fail to account for grader effects and, thus, can be biased. The proposed approach produces more accurate model parameter estimates and, therefore, more accurate aggregated grades, by modeling the heterogeneous grading behavior with latent variables. Second, the proposed method provides a way to assess each student's performance as a grader, which may be used to identify a pool of reliable graders or generate feedback to help students improve their grading.

This study addresses a critical gap by exploring student and academic staff experiences with AI and GenAI tools, focusing on their familiarity and comfort with current and potential future applications in learning and assessment. An online survey collected data from 35 academic staff and 282 students across two universities in Vietnam and one in Singapore, examining GenAI familiarity, perceptions of its use in assessment marking and feedback, knowledge checking and participation, and experiences of GenAI text detection.   Descriptive statistics and reflexive thematic analysis revealed a generally low familiarity with GenAI among both groups. GenAI feedback was viewed negatively; however, it was viewed more positively when combined with instructor feedback. Academic staff were more accepting of GenAI text detection tools and grade adjustments based on detection results compared to students. Qualitative analysis identified three themes: unclear understanding of text detection tools, variability in experiences with GenAI detectors, and mixed feelings about GenAI's future impact on educational assessment. These findings have major implications regarding the development of policies and practices for GenAI-enabled assessment and feedback in higher education.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15808v1\", \"timestamp\": 1719051901, \"domain\": \"cs.HC\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0c5d9c24-b6c4-497b-9f33-e2378ef89ea1\", \"authors\": [\"Anishka\", \"Atharva Mehta\", \"Nipun Gupta\", \"Aarav Balachandran\", \"Dhruv Kumar\", \"Pankaj Jalote\"], \"title\": \"Can ChatGPT Play the Role of a Teaching Assistant in an Introductory Programming Course?\", \"abstract\": \"The emergence of Large language models (LLMs) is expected to have a major impact on education.

The TA functions which we focus on include (1) grading student code submissions, and (2) providing feedback to undergraduate students in an introductory programming course. Firstly, we assess ChatGPT's proficiency in grading student code submissions using a given grading rubric and compare its performance with the grades assigned by human TAs. Secondly, we analyze the quality and relevance of the feedback provided by ChatGPT. This evaluation considers how well ChatGPT addresses mistakes and offers suggestions for improvement in student solutions from both code correctness and code quality perspectives.

The development of an effective automated grading and feedback system can help reduce the workload of instructors, improve the consistency and accuracy of grading, and provide students with timely and personalized feedback. This, in turn, can lead to improved student learning outcomes, increased student satisfaction, and enhanced educational experiences. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of educational technology and have practical applications in various educational settings.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping an effective automated grading and feedback system for open-ended assignments in STEM education is challenging due to several reasons. Firstly, open-ended assignments often require complex and nuanced grading criteria, making it difficult to develop a system that can accurately assess student work. Secondly, the system must be able to handle the variability in student responses, including differences in language, tone, and style. Thirdly, the system must be able to provide high-quality feedback that is relevant, specific, and actionable, which requires a deep understanding of the subject matter and the learning objectives. Finally, the system must be scalable and able to handle large volumes of student work, which requires significant computational resources and advanced algorithms.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nDespite the growing interest in automated grading and feedback systems, previous research has been limited by several factors. Firstly, many existing systems rely on simple metrics such as keyword matching or sentence similarity, which are not sufficient to capture the complexity of open-ended assignments. Secondly, many systems lack the ability to provide high-quality feedback that is relevant and actionable. Thirdly, many systems are not scalable and are limited to small-scale deployments. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging the latest advances in LLMs and natural language processing to develop a system that can accurately assess student work and provide high-quality feedback. We also propose a novel methodology that combines human-in-the-loop feedback with automated grading to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the system.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology consists of the following key components:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: We will collect a large dataset of open-ended assignments in STEM education, along with corresponding grading rubrics and feedback.\n2. **LLM-based Grading**: We will develop an LLM-based grading system that can accurately assess student work and provide high-quality feedback.\n3. **Human-in-the-loop Feedback**: We will implement a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism that allows instructors to review and correct the automated grading and feedback.\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: We will develop a set of evaluation metrics that can assess the accuracy, consistency, and effectiveness of the automated grading and feedback system.\n5. **Deployment and Testing**: We will deploy the system in a real-world educational setting and test its effectiveness in improving student learning outcomes and reducing instructor workload.\n\nWe expect the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Improved Accuracy**: The automated grading and feedback system will achieve high accuracy in assessing student work and providing high-quality feedback.\n2. **Increased Consistency**: The system will provide consistent grading and feedback across different instructors and assignments.\n3. **Reduced Instructor Workload**: The system will reduce the workload of instructors by automating the grading and feedback process.\n4. **Improved Student Learning Outcomes**: The system will improve student learning outcomes by providing timely and personalized feedback.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

These problems are particularly challenging because they involve multiple objectives and constraints, making them difficult to solve using traditional optimization methods. By developing an efficient and robust algorithm to solve these problems, we can enable researchers and practitioners to tackle complex optimization problems that were previously unsolvable.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nSolving lexicographic multi-objective semi-definite programming problems is hard because they involve multiple objectives and constraints, which can lead to conflicting solutions. Additionally, these problems often involve non-convex constraints and objectives, making them difficult to solve using traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, the problems can be unbounded or infeasible, which requires the development of specialized algorithms to handle these cases. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they do not take into account the complexities of the problem, such as the non-convexity of the constraints and objectives.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nDespite the importance of lexicographic multi-objective semi-definite programming problems, they have not been solved before because of the lack of efficient and robust algorithms to tackle these problems. Existing methods, such as the NA-IPM algorithm, have limitations and are not able to handle the complexities of these problems. Additionally, the development of algorithms for these problems requires a deep understanding of optimization theory, numerical analysis, and computer science, which can be a barrier to entry for researchers.

See full examples at[1, 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure\u00a01 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo leads the LLM to perform the task.

Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure\u00a01 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond.

Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations.

In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered.

We show that GPT-4o demonstrates good resistance to forbidden questions and text jailbreak prompts when directly transferring them to voice mode. This resistance is primarily due to GPT-4o's internal safeguards and the difficulty of adapting text jailbreak prompts to voice mode. Inspired by GPT-4o's human-like behaviors, we propose VoiceJailbreak, a novel voice jailbreak attack that humanizes GPT-4o and attempts to persuade it through fictional storytelling (setting, character, and plot). VoiceJailbreak is capable of generating simple, audible, yet effective jailbreak prompts, which significantly increases the average attack success rate (ASR) from 0.033 to 0.778 in six forbidden scenarios.

One significant method type of attack is the jailbreak attack, which designed to evade model safety mechanisms and induce the generation of inappropriate content. Existing jailbreak attacks primarily rely on crafting inducement prompts for direct jailbreaks, which are less effective against large models with robust filtering and high comprehension abilities. Given the increasing demand for real-time capabilities in large language models, real-time updates and iterations of new knowledge have become essential. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an advanced technique to compensate for the model's lack of new knowledge, is gradually becoming mainstream. As RAG enables the model to utilize external knowledge bases, it provides a new avenue for jailbreak attacks.   In this paper, we conduct the first work to propose the concept of indirect jailbreak and achieve Retrieval-Augmented Generation via LangChain. Building on this, we further design a novel method of indirect jailbreak attack, termed Poisoned-LangChain (PLC), which leverages a poisoned external knowledge base to interact with large language models, thereby causing the large models to generate malicious non-compliant dialogues.We tested this method on six different large language models across three major categories of jailbreak issues.

Existing jailbreak attacks on LLMs can be categorized into prompt-level methods which make up stories/logic to circumvent safety alignment and token-level attack methods which leverage gradient methods to find adversarial tokens. In this work, we introduce the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak and explore methods that can integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack.

Here, however, we compare linear and nonlinear methods to study the features in prompts that contribute to successful jailbreaks. We do this by probing for jailbreak success based only on the portions of the latent representations corresponding to prompt tokens. First, we introduce a dataset of 10,800 jailbreak attempts from 35 attack methods. We then show that different jailbreaking methods work via different nonlinear features in prompts. Specifically, we find that while probes can distinguish between successful and unsuccessful jailbreaking prompts with a high degree of accuracy, they often transfer poorly to held-out attack methods. We also show that nonlinear probes can be used to mechanistically jailbreak the LLM by guiding the design of adversarial latent perturbations. These mechanistic jailbreaks are able to jailbreak Gemma-7B-IT more reliably than 34 of the 35 techniques that it was trained on.

For example, healthcare records, hygienic procedures, government communication, emergency procedures and religious texts are all limited texts. While generic translation engines for all languages do not exist, translation of multilingually known limited texts into new, low-resource languages may be possible and reduce human translation effort. We attempt to leverage translation resources from rich-resource languages to efficiently produce best possible translation quality for well known texts, which are available in multiple languages, in a new, low-resource language. To reach this goal, we argue that in translating a closed text into low-resource languages, generalization to out-of-domain texts is not necessary, but generalization to new languages is. Performance gain comes from massive source parallelism by careful choice of close-by language families, style-consistent corpus-level paraphrases within the same language and strategic adaptation of existing large pretrained multilingual models to the domain first and then to the language.

The experiments demonstrate that PLC successfully implemented indirect jailbreak attacks under three different scenarios, achieving success rates of 88.56%, 79.04%, and 82.69% respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18122v1\", \"timestamp\": 1719386462, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"bc10126a-217e-4cea-82fd-28e1a9bff5de\", \"authors\": [\"Jiahao Zhang\", \"Zilong Wang\", \"Ruofan Wang\", \"Xingjun Ma\", \"Yu-Gang Jiang\"], \"title\": \"EnJa: Ensemble Jailbreak on Large Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in safety-critical applications, their vulnerability to potential jailbreaks -- malicious prompts that can disable the safety mechanism of LLMs -- has attracted growing research attention. While alignment methods have been proposed to protect LLMs from jailbreaks, many have found that aligned LLMs can still be jailbroken by carefully crafted malicious prompts, producing content that violates policy regulations. Existing jailbreak attacks on LLMs can be categorized into prompt-level methods which make up stories/logic to circumvent safety alignment and token-level attack methods which leverage gradient methods to find adversarial tokens. In this work, we introduce the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak and explore methods that can integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack. Specifically, we propose a novel EnJa attack to hide harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak, boost the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack, and connect the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector. We evaluate the effectiveness of EnJa on several aligned models and show that it achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03603v1\", \"timestamp\": 1723016768, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"cf44963b-75fb-478e-9c2b-1549423d24f7\", \"authors\": [\"Nathalie Maria Kirch\", \"Severin Field\", \"Stephen Casper\"], \"title\": \"What Features in Prompts Jailbreak LLMs? Investigating the Mechanisms Behind Attacks\", \"abstract\": \"While `jailbreaks' have been central to research on the safety and reliability of LLMs (large language models), the underlying mechanisms behind these attacks are not well understood. Some prior works have used linear methods to analyze jailbreak prompts or model refusal. Here, however, we compare linear and nonlinear methods to study the features in prompts that contribute to successful jailbreaks. We do this by probing for jailbreak success based only on the portions of the latent representations corresponding to prompt tokens. First, we introduce a dataset of 10,800 jailbreak attempts from 35 attack methods. We then show that different jailbreaking methods work via different nonlinear features in prompts. Specifically, we find that while probes can distinguish between successful and unsuccessful jailbreaking prompts with a high degree of accuracy, they often transfer poorly to held-out attack methods. We also show that nonlinear probes can be used to mechanistically jailbreak the LLM by guiding the design of adversarial latent perturbations. These mechanistic jailbreaks are able to jailbreak Gemma-7B-IT more reliably than 34 of the 35 techniques that it was trained on. Ultimately, our results suggest that jailbreaks cannot be thoroughly understood in terms of universal or linear prompt features alone.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03343v1\", \"timestamp\": 1730568587, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"5896158a-f341-49e0-87bf-c6e7cc4a6d2f\", \"authors\": [\"Xiaoxia Li\", \"Siyuan Liang\", \"Jiyi Zhang\", \"Han Fang\", \"Aishan Liu\", \"Ee-Chien Chang\"], \"title\": \"Semantic Mirror Jailbreak: Genetic Algorithm Based Jailbreak Prompts Against Open-source LLMs\", \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs), used in creative writing, code generation, and translation, generate text based on input sequences but are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted prompts induce harmful outputs. Most jailbreak prompt methods use a combination of jailbreak templates followed by questions to ask to create jailbreak prompts. However, existing jailbreak prompt designs generally suffer from excessive semantic differences, resulting in an inability to resist defenses that use simple semantic metrics as thresholds. Jailbreak prompts are semantically more varied than the original questions used for queries. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic Mirror Jailbreak (SMJ) approach that bypasses LLMs by generating jailbreak prompts that are semantically similar to the original question. We model the search for jailbreak prompts that satisfy both semantic similarity and jailbreak validity as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ a standardized set of genetic algorithms for generating eligible prompts. Compared to the baseline AutoDAN-GA, SMJ achieves attack success rates (ASR) that are at most 35.4% higher without ONION defense and 85.2% higher with ONION defense. SMJ's better performance in all three semantic meaningfulness metrics of Jailbreak Prompt, Similarity, and Outlier, also means that SMJ is resistant to defenses that use those metrics as thresholds.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14872v2\", \"timestamp\": 1708528430, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent6", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"34e16cc6-ed65-403a-9d37-9b8c075eaf3e\", \"authors\": [\"Jumbly Grindrod\"], \"title\": \"Modelling Language\", \"abstract\": \"This paper argues that large language models have a valuable scientific role to play in serving as scientific models of a language.

Central to semantics is the relationship between a sentence and the (actual) world. Carefully examining semantics-related issues in the modeling languages field to avoid problems that may affect practical applicability is important. One effort in this direction is OMG s release of a 2020 draft specification for Foundational UML (fUML), with the base semantics specifying executions that are executable in the same sense as a program in a traditional programming language. Additionally, efforts within academia have sought to develop an alternative approach to modeling languages using formal semantics (e.g., using Russell s theory of types and Tarski s declarative semantics). This paper aims at a similar exploratory venture of developing semantics, only for a much more modest diagrammatic modeling language, called the thinging machine model. The model promotes a deep understanding of the scrutinized modeling language and leads to considerably fruitful questions.

A robust detection and prevention method can help ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, which is essential for their widespread adoption. Moreover, addressing this problem can advance our understanding of the vulnerabilities of LLMs and lead to the development of more secure and robust models. This, in turn, can have significant practical applications in areas such as natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDetecting and preventing jailbreak attacks on LLMs is a challenging problem due to the complexity and variability of the attacks. Jailbreak attacks can be launched through various means, including text-based, voice-based, and multimodal attacks, making it difficult to develop a comprehensive detection method. Moreover, LLMs are highly complex systems, and understanding their behavior and vulnerabilities requires significant expertise in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Additionally, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks and datasets for jailbreak attacks makes it difficult to develop and test effective detection methods.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nDespite the importance of the problem, previous research has not fully addressed the issue of detecting and preventing jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Existing solutions have focused primarily on developing ad-hoc detection methods for specific types of attacks, which are often ineffective against more sophisticated attacks. Moreover, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks and datasets has made it difficult to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different detection methods.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), built upon auto-regressive transformer\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017; OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023), have demonstrated dominance in natural language generation due to the incredible context modeling and scalability. Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2. We partially follow the scaling rule proposed in the previous works\u00a0(Sun et\u00a0al., 2024; Tian et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\n\nModel\nParameters\n\nInter-Blocks N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N\n\n\nIntra-Blocks L\ud835\udc3fLitalic_L\n\n\nWidths w\ud835\udc64witalic_w\n\n\nHeads h\u210ehitalic_h\n\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-B\n343M\n24\n2\n1024\n16\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-L\n804M\n36\n3\n1280\n20\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-XL\n1.5B\n48\n4\n1536\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Method\n\n\n2.1 Overview\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2 is composed of two significant stages. One is a powerful visual tokenizer that maps the input visual signal into the discrete token representations. Subsequently, the vector-quantized sequence will be fed into the auto-regressive transformer for intra- and inter-token relationship modeling, eventually for visual synthesis.\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of Open-MAGVIT2. There are two crucial stages in Open-MAGVIT2. In Stage II\\mathrm{I}roman_I: the image is first encoded by MAGVIT-v2 Encoder and subsequently transformed into bits format by Lookup-Free Quantizer (LFQ).

A high-performance visual tokenizer can also have broader implications for various applications, such as image and video synthesis, data compression, and computer vision.

Firstly, the complexity of the codebook and the computational resources required to process it can be overwhelming. Secondly, the tokenizer needs to balance the trade-off between codebook size and utilization, which can be difficult to optimize. Finally, the tokenizer must be able to handle the variability and diversity of visual data, which can be a significant challenge. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to address these challenges, and a more sophisticated and innovative solution is required.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing visual tokenizers with limited codebook sizes, which can lead to poor generation quality. The existing solutions, such as VQ-VAE, have limitations in terms of codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE used in diffusion models. The recent work on MAGVIT-v2 has proposed a Lookup-Free Quantizer, but it is closed-source and not accessible to the research community.

This approach has achieved impressive results and has contributed significantly to the progress of AI, particularly in the sphere of supervised deep learning.

However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for Big Data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages. In this work, we present a thorough review of approaches for automating data processing tasks in deep learning pipelines, including automated data preprocessing--e.g., data cleaning, labeling, missing data imputation, and categorical data encoding--as well as data augmentation (including synthetic data generation using generative AI methods) and feature engineering--specifically, automated feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection.

AutoMAN is based on effectively exploring the candidate transforms space, without explicitly manifesting transformed features. This is achieved by learning feature importance masks, which can be extended to support other modalities such as time series.

This can have significant implications for various applications such as language translation, text classification, and question-answering systems. Moreover, addressing this problem can advance our understanding of language models and their limitations, leading to more robust and reliable models that can be used in real-world applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping effective large language models for multilingual tasks is challenging due to several reasons. Firstly, the scarcity of labeled data for low-resource languages makes it difficult to train and fine-tune models. Secondly, the complexity of linguistic structures and nuances across different languages requires models to be highly adaptable and flexible. Thirdly, the need to balance the trade-off between model performance and computational resources adds an additional layer of complexity. Naive approaches such as simply increasing the model size or using pre-trained models may not be effective, and more sophisticated methods such as transfer learning, meta-learning, and few-shot learning may be required.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused primarily on developing large language models for high-resource languages such as English, with limited attention paid to low-resource languages. Existing solutions such as multilingual language models have shown promise but are often limited by the quality and quantity of training data. Moreover, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks for multilingual tasks has hindered progress in this area. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that combines transfer learning, meta-learning, and few-shot learning to develop more effective and efficient large language models for multilingual tasks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components:\n\n1. **Transfer learning**: We will use pre-trained models as a starting point and fine-tune them on a small set of labeled data for the target low-resource language.\n2. **Meta-learning**: We will use meta-learning algorithms to adapt the model to new languages and tasks with minimal additional training data.\n3. **Few-shot learning**: We will use few-shot learning techniques to enable the model to learn from a small number of examples and generalize to new tasks and languages.\n4. **Multilingual dataset**: We will create a large-scale multilingual dataset that includes a diverse set of languages and tasks.\n5. **Evaluation metrics**: We will develop standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks for multilingual tasks to assess the performance of our model.\n\nExpected outcomes include:\n\n1. **Improved performance**: Our model is expected to outperform existing state-of-the-art models on multilingual tasks.\n2. **Increased efficiency**: Our model is expected to be more efficient in terms of computational resources and training data requirements.\n3. **Better generalization**: Our model is expected to generalize better to new languages and tasks with minimal additional training data.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 44735, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 6, "agent2": 3}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Furthermore, existing works focus on capturing anomalous graph information to learn better graph representations, but they ignore the importance of an effective anomaly score function for evaluating abnormal graphs. Thus, in this work, we first define anomalous graph information including node and graph property anomalies in a graph set and adopt node-level and graph-level information differences to identify them, respectively. Then, we introduce a discriminative graph-level anomaly detection framework with dual-students-teacher model, where the teacher model with a heuristic loss are trained to make graph representations more divergent.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a graph-based method for unsupervised log anomaly detection, dubbed Logs2Graphs, which first converts event logs into attributed, directed, and weighted graphs, and then leverages graph neural networks to perform graph-level anomaly detection.

In real-world scenarios, it is often feasible to obtain limited labeled anomalies, which have great potential to advance graph anomaly detection. However, the work exploring limited labeled anomalies and a large amount of unlabeled nodes in graphs to detect anomalies is relatively limited.

They learn a large number of pixel patterns and features related to known scenes during training, making them effective in detecting anomalies within these familiar contexts. However, when encountering new or significantly changed scenes, i.e., unknown scenes, they often fail because existing SOTA methods do not effectively capture the relationship between actions and their surrounding scenes, resulting in low generalization. In contrast, action-based methods focus on detecting anomalies in human actions but are usually less informative because they tend to overlook the relationship between actions and their scenes, leading to incorrect detection.

In the second scenario, by analyzing the distribution of abnormal nodes, we find that the nodes of traffic anomalies are associated with the event of postgraduate entrance examination on the same day.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14196v1\", \"timestamp\": 1653677693, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f8c87bd3-8bab-4ede-916a-858a91d31f80\", \"authors\": [\"Zhiyuan You\", \"Kai Yang\", \"Wenhan Luo\", \"Lei Cui\", \"Yu Zheng\", \"Xinyi Le\"], \"title\": \"ADTR: Anomaly Detection Transformer with Feature Reconstruction\", \"abstract\": \"Anomaly detection with only prior knowledge from normal samples attracts more attention because of the lack of anomaly samples. Existing CNN-based pixel reconstruction approaches suffer from two concerns. First, the reconstruction source and target are raw pixel values that contain indistinguishable semantic information. Second, CNN tends to reconstruct both normal samples and anomalies well, making them still hard to distinguish. In this paper, we propose Anomaly Detection TRansformer (ADTR) to apply a transformer to reconstruct pre-trained features. The pre-trained features contain distinguishable semantic information. Also, the adoption of transformer limits to reconstruct anomalies well such that anomalies could be detected easily once the reconstruction fails. Moreover, we propose novel loss functions to make our approach compatible with the normal-sample-only case and the anomaly-available case with both image-level and pixel-level labeled anomalies. The performance could be further improved by adding simple synthetic or external irrelevant anomalies. Extensive experiments are conducted on anomaly detection datasets including MVTec-AD and CIFAR-10. Our method achieves superior performance compared with all baselines.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01816v3\", \"timestamp\": 1662364887, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively detect graph-level anomalies in complex networks, considering both local and global patterns, and addressing the challenges of existing methods that rely on graph features or node-level information?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nDetecting graph-level anomalies is crucial in various domains, such as identifying abnormal proteins in biochemistry, distinguishing brain disorders in brain networks, and uncovering fraudulent activities in online social networks. Solving this problem can lead to significant advancements in knowledge and practical applications, including improved network security, disease diagnosis, and financial risk management. A robust graph-level anomaly detection method can also enable the discovery of new patterns and relationships in complex networks, driving innovation and progress in various fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDetecting graph-level anomalies is challenging due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to consider both local and global patterns. Existing methods often rely on graph features or node-level information, which may not capture the essence of anomalies. Moreover, graph-level anomalies can be subtle and difficult to distinguish from normal patterns, making it hard to develop effective detection methods. Additionally, the lack of labeled anomaly data and the need for unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches add to the complexity of the problem.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on node-level anomaly detection or relied on graph features, which may not capture the global patterns and relationships in complex networks. Existing methods also often suffer from the \"anomaly overfitting\" problem, where models are biased towards normal patterns and fail to detect anomalies. Furthermore, the lack of a unified framework for graph-level anomaly detection has hindered progress in this area. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that combines local and global pattern information, addressing the limitations of existing methods and providing a more comprehensive solution for graph-level anomaly detection.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology, Hierarchical Memory Networks (HimNet), consists of two modules: a node-level memory module and a graph-level memory module. The node-level module is trained to model fine-grained, internal graph interactions among nodes, while the graph-level module is dedicated to learning holistic normal patterns for detecting globally abnormal graphs. We use a graph autoencoder network architecture to jointly optimize the two modules and detect both locally- and globally-anomalous graphs. Our approach is evaluated on 16 real-world graph datasets from various domains, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in detecting graph-level anomalies. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the results, highlighting the advantages of our approach over existing methods and discussing the implications of our findings for future research.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

One potential direction to alleviate the\nneed for parallel data is to enhance cross-lingual\ntransfer of sentence embeddings.\nPre-trained multilingual language models (Pires\net al., 2019; Phang et al., 2020) have shown im-\npressive performance on cross-lingual zero-shot\ntransfer (Pires et al., 2019) that a model \ufb01netuned\non a source language can generalize to target lan-\nguages. This implies the representations \ufb01netuned\non downstream tasks are universal across various\nlanguages. In this work, we explore various cross-\nlingual transfer settings on sentence retrieval tasks,\nespecially in the setting of using English data only.\nWe propose multilingual-SimCSE (mSimCSE)\nwhich extends SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021), a fa-\nmous sentence embedding method on English, to\nmultilingual for cross-lingual transfer. SimCSE isarXiv:2211.06127v1  [cs.CL]  11 Nov 2022a contrastive learning (Chopra et al., 2005; Hadsell\net al., 2006; Chen et al., 2020a) method that pulls\ncloser semantically similar sentences (i.e. positive\nsentence pairs) in embeddings space. As done in\nSimCSE, we obtain positive training pairs by either\nnatural language inference (NLI) (Conneau et al.,\n2017; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) supervision or\nunsupervised data augmentation using dropout. We\nalso investigate model performance when a small\namount of parallel data or cross-lingual NLI data\nare available.\nIn our experiments.\nWe use our method to \ufb01netune XLM-Roberta-large\n(XLM-R) (Conneau et al., 2020). We examine the\nperformance of different hyperparameters in Ap-\npendix A\nTraining Data for Different mSimCSE Strate-\ngies In unsupervised mSimCSE and English NLI\nsupervised mSimCSE, we use the pre-processed\nEnglish Wikipedia and English NLI training tuples\ndownloaded from the SimCSE codebase respec-\ntively.

The ability to align cross-lingual sentence embeddings without relying on large amounts of parallel data has significant implications for various applications, including multi-lingual document retrieval, question answering, and machine translation. This research can also contribute to the development of more robust and generalizable NLP models that can handle diverse languages and dialects.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nAligning cross-lingual sentence embeddings without relying on large amounts of parallel data is challenging due to the complexity of language structures, nuances, and cultural differences. Naive approaches may fail to capture the subtleties of language, leading to poor performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, the lack of parallel data for many languages makes it difficult to develop and evaluate models that can effectively align cross-lingual sentence embeddings.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has relied heavily on large amounts of parallel data to align cross-lingual sentence embeddings, which is not feasible for many languages. Existing solutions have also focused on specific languages or tasks, limiting their generalizability. Furthermore, the complexity of language structures and nuances has made it challenging to develop models that can effectively capture the subtleties of language. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel method that leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to align cross-lingual sentence embeddings without relying on large amounts of parallel data.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components:\n\n* **Method:** We propose a novel method called multilingual-SimCSE (mSimCSE), which extends the SimCSE framework to multilingual settings. mSimCSE uses contrastive learning and data augmentation to align cross-lingual sentence embeddings.\n* **Dataset:** We will use a combination of monolingual and multilingual datasets, including the XNLI corpus and Wikipedia articles in multiple languages.\n* **Metrics:** We will evaluate our model using metrics such as cosine similarity, precision, recall, and F1-score on downstream tasks such as multi-lingual document retrieval, question answering, and machine translation.\n* **Expected outcomes:** We expect our model to outperform existing solutions on downstream tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in aligning cross-lingual sentence embeddings without relying on large amounts of parallel data.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 41562, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 3}, "total_milestones": 3, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

These challenges make it difficult to fully\nleverage GNN potential and its applications.\nTo address these challenges, recent work such as OGBN and\nMAG [ 26,27] have proposed open large graph benchmark suites\nproviding up to 244 million nodes and 1.7 billion edge graphs.

On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node classification.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15487v3\", \"timestamp\": 1679903623, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"20bc8026-cd44-496d-b0e3-f74648262a8c\", \"authors\": [\"Zheyi Qin\", \"Randy Paffenroth\", \"Anura P.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and especially those algorithms that capture graph topology through message passing for neighborhood aggregation, have been a leading solution. However, these networks often require substantial computational resources and may not optimally leverage the information contained in the graph's topology, particularly for large-scale or complex graphs. We propose Topology Coordinate Neural Network (TCNN) and Directional Virtual Coordinate Neural Network (DVCNN) as novel and efficient alternatives to message passing GNNs, that directly leverage the graph's topology, sidestepping the computational challenges presented by competing algorithms. Our proposed methods can be viewed as a reprise of classic techniques for graph embedding for neural network feature engineering, but they are novel in that our embedding techniques leverage ideas in Graph Coordinates (GC) that are lacking in current practice. Experimental results, benchmarked against the Open Graph Benchmark Leaderboard, demonstrate that TCNN and DVCNN achieve competitive or superior performance to message passing GNNs. For similar levels of accuracy and ROC-AUC, TCNN and DVCNN need far fewer trainable parameters than contenders of the OGBN Leaderboard. The proposed TCNN architecture requires fewer parameters than any neural network method currently listed in the OGBN Leaderboard for both OGBN-Proteins and OGBN-Products datasets. Conversely, our methods achieve higher performance for a similar number of trainable parameters. By providing an efficient and effective alternative to message passing GNNs, our work expands the toolbox of techniques for graph-based machine learning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01342v1\", \"timestamp\": 1701598450, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"99d5d189-03da-41b4-97ff-e1c8d27107bd\", \"authors\": [\"Stanislav Sobolevsky\"], \"title\": \"Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"Over the recent years, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly popular in network analytic and beyond.

This paper aims to connect the dots between the traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well as the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network features at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and stability of the individual node feature learning. The proposed Hierarchical Graph Neural network architecture is successfully evaluated on the network embedding and modeling as well as network classification, node labeling, and community tasks and demonstrates increased efficiency in those.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03388v2\", \"timestamp\": 1620406038, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"24556766-b18a-45fb-8a41-dbde6a2b9954\", \"authors\": [\"M.

We aim to investigate any existing correlations between graph theoretic properties and the robustness of Sparse Neural Networks. Our hypothesis is, that graph theoretic properties as a prior of neural network structures are related to their robustness. To answer to this hypothesis, we designed an empirical study with neural network models obtained through random graphs used as sparse structural priors for the networks. We additionally investigated the evaluation of a randomly pruned fully connected network as a point of reference.   We found that robustness measures are independent of initialization methods but show weak correlations with graph properties: higher graph densities correlate with lower robustness, but higher average path lengths and average node eccentricities show negative correlations with robustness measures.

In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP).

A more effective and efficient GNN framework can lead to better performance on graph-related tasks, which can have significant practical implications, such as improving the accuracy of recommendation systems, enhancing the understanding of molecular structures, and optimizing social network analysis.

By leveraging the strengths of both quantum and classical computing, we can develop more efficient and accurate image classification models. This research can also lead to breakthroughs in other areas, such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nIntegrating quantum computing and classical machine learning techniques is challenging due to the fundamentally different nature of these two paradigms. Quantum computing relies on quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, whereas classical machine learning is based on classical probability theory. Moreover, quantum computers are prone to noise and error, which can significantly impact the accuracy of image classification models. Developing a robust and efficient hybrid approach that can effectively leverage the strengths of both quantum and classical computing is a significant technical challenge.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on either purely quantum or classical machine learning approaches, with limited attempts to integrate these two paradigms. Existing hybrid approaches often rely on simplistic or ad-hoc methods, which may not fully exploit the potential of quantum computing. Moreover, the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets and the limited availability of quantum computing resources have hindered the development of robust and efficient hybrid image classification models. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a systematic and principled method for integrating quantum computing and classical machine learning techniques, leveraging recent advances in quantum computing hardware and software.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach, \"Quantum-Classical Hybrid Machine Learning for Image Classification,\" involves the following key components:\n\n1. **Quantum Circuit Learning**: We will develop a novel quantum circuit learning framework that can effectively learn and represent image features using quantum circuits.\n2. **Classical Machine Learning**: We will integrate the quantum circuit learning framework with classical machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to develop a robust and efficient hybrid image classification model.\n3. **Dataset**: We will use a large-scale, high-quality dataset, such as ImageNet, to evaluate the performance of our hybrid model.\n4. **Metrics**: We will use standard metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, to evaluate the performance of our hybrid model.\n5. **Expected Outcomes**: We expect our hybrid model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks, outperforming both purely quantum and classical machine learning approaches.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 30893, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 1}, "total_milestones": 1, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Prior works on time series diffusion models have primarily focused on developing conditional models tailored to specific forecasting or imputation tasks. In this work, we explore the potential of task-agnostic, unconditional diffusion models for several time series applications. We propose TSDiff, an unconditionally-trained diffusion model for time series. Our proposed self-guidance mechanism enables conditioning TSDiff for downstream tasks during inference, without requiring auxiliary networks or altering the training procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three different time series tasks: forecasting, refinement, and synthetic data generation. First, we show that TSDiff is competitive with several task-specific conditional forecasting methods (predict). Second, we leverage the learned implicit probability density of TSDiff to iteratively refine the predictions of base forecasters with reduced computational overhead over reverse diffusion (refine). Notably, the generative performance of the model remains intact -- downstream forecasters trained on synthetic samples from TSDiff outperform forecasters that are trained on samples from other state-of-the-art generative time series models, occasionally even outperforming models trained on real data (synthesize).\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11494v3\", \"timestamp\": 1689936996, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f80a28be-16d5-4c78-8324-68a4d839584e\", \"authors\": [\"Hao Yang\", \"Zhanbo Feng\", \"Feng Zhou\", \"Robert C Qiu\", \"Zenan Ling\"], \"title\": \"Series-to-Series Diffusion Bridge Model\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models have risen to prominence in time series forecasting, showcasing their robust capability to model complex data distributions.

Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel diffusion-based time series forecasting model, the Series-to-Series Diffusion Bridge Model ($\\\\mathrm{S^2DBM}$), which leverages the Brownian Bridge process to reduce randomness in reverse estimations and improves accuracy by incorporating informative priors and conditions derived from historical time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that $\\\\mathrm{S^2DBM}$ delivers superior performance in point-to-point forecasting and competes effectively with other diffusion-based models in probabilistic forecasting.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04491v1\", \"timestamp\": 1730965054, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"eb5bd76f-8eb2-40c0-ae6a-786df072f017\", \"authors\": [\"Shi Zhao\", \"Ying Feng\"], \"title\": \"For2For: Learning to forecast from forecasts\", \"abstract\": \"This paper presents a time series forecasting framework which combines standard forecasting methods and a machine learning model.

However, it is common that real-world time series data are recorded in a short time period, which results in a big gap between the deep model and the limited and noisy time series. In this work, we propose to address the time series forecasting problem with generative modeling and propose a bidirectional variational auto-encoder (BVAE) equipped with diffusion, denoise, and disentanglement, namely D3VAE. Specifically, a coupled diffusion probabilistic model is proposed to augment the time series data without increasing the aleatoric uncertainty and implement a more tractable inference process with BVAE. To ensure the generated series move toward the true target, we further propose to adapt and integrate the multiscale denoising score matching into the diffusion process for time series forecasting. In addition, to enhance the interpretability and stability of the prediction, we treat the latent variable in a multivariate manner and disentangle them on top of minimizing total correlation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that D3VAE outperforms competitive algorithms with remarkable margins.

Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures.

By comparing and re-examining various deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and presents the latest trends in time series forecasting, including the emergence of hybrid models, diffusion models, Mamba models, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction.

To this end, we propose a generic channel-aware Contrastive Conditional Diffusion model entitled CCDM to achieve desirable Multivariate probabilistic forecasting, obviating the need for curated temporal conditioning inductive biases. In detail, we first design a channel-centric conditional denoising network to manage intra-variate variations and cross-variate correlations, which can lead to scalability on diverse prediction horizons and channel numbers. Then, we devise an ad-hoc denoising-based temporal contrastive learning to explicitly amplify the predictive mutual information between past observations and future forecasts. It can coherently complement naive step-wise denoising diffusion training and improve the forecasting accuracy and generality on unknown test time series. Besides, we offer theoretic insights on the benefits of such auxiliary contrastive training refinement from both neural mutual information and temporal distribution generalization aspects.

A more accurate and efficient forecasting model can lead to better decision-making, risk management, and resource allocation. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the development of more sophisticated generative models that can handle complex data distributions.

Firstly, diffusion models are inherently stochastic, which can lead to instability in deterministic predictions. Secondly, multivariate probabilistic forecasting requires modeling complex dependencies and correlations between variables, which can be difficult to capture using traditional methods. Thirdly, existing diffusion-based models may not be scalable to large datasets or high-dimensional data. Finally, evaluating the performance of diffusion-based models can be challenging due to the lack of clear evaluation metrics.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research on diffusion-based time series forecasting has primarily focused on developing conditional models tailored to specific forecasting or imputation tasks.

Nevertheless, the quantity \nof data remains decisive for the quality of a supervised classifier. Originating from the field of computer vision, many \ndifferent conclusion for this survey.  3 2 BACKGROUND: FOUNDATIONS, GOALS, AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA AUGMENTATION  \nIn many machine learning scenarios, not enough data is available to train a high -quality classifier. To a ddress this \nproblem, data augmentation can be used. It artificially enlarges the amount of available training data by means of \ntransformations [7]. In the well-known LeNet by LeCun et al. [8], early versions of data augmentation have already been \nobserved . The notion of data augmentation comprises various research in different sub -areas of machine learning. Many \nscientific works merely relate data augmentation to deep learning, yet it is frequently applied in the entire context of \nmachine learning. Therefore, this paper a dopts the notion of data augmentation as a broad concept, encompassing any \nmethod that enables the transformation of training data. However, following common understanding in research, semi -\nsupervised learning is not regarded as a form of data augmentation  and is only thematized if sensible in this survey.  \nAn important term relating to  data augmentation is label preservation, which describes transformations of training \ndata that preserve class information [9]. For exa mple, i n sentiment analysis, an entity replacement within a sentence is \noften sufficient for label preservation , but randomly adding  words may alter the sentiment (e.g., an additional \u201cnot\u201d \ncould invert the meaning of a sentence). In many research works, l abel preservation is adapted to also cover \ntransformations changing the class information , if the label is adjusted correctly. Additionally, many transformations do \nnot maintain the correct  class  in every case , but with a high probability. Shorten and Khoshgoftaar [5] define this \nprobability as the safety of a data augmentation method. When this uncertainty is known, it could be directly integrated \nin the label. Otherwise, conclusions. T he benchmark should not be too large, in order to ensure specific evaluations can \nstill be carried out . Researchers that try to develop such a benchmark, could also consider to specify how much data \naugmentation should be performed  and what models should be used.  When determining which model should be used , it \nmight be useful to create an updatable benchmark, as proposed by Gehrmann et al [157] , which can be modified \naccording to more recent state -of-the-art models.  \n4.4 Enhancing the Understanding  of Text  Data Augmentation   \nShorten and  Khoshgoftaar  [5] highlight that  while  for some image data augmentation techniques it is easy to understand \nhow they might improve the dataset and derived classifiers , however , for other techniques  this improvement has not \nbeen  explainable  yet. This also applies to the text regime, where for example, data augmentation results in a continuity \nproblem of learning, so that, e.g., the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

We develop an understanding of data augmentation as regularization, which highlights the major features. As a result, data augmentation significantly reduces the generalization error, but meanwhile leads to a slightly higher empirical risk. On the assumption that data augmentation helps models converge to a better region, the model can benefit from a lower empirical risk achieved by a simple method, i.e., using less-augmented data to refine the model trained on fully-augmented data.

The main limitation of data augmentation arises from the data bias, i.e. the augmented data distribution can be quite different from the original one. This data bias leads to a suboptimal performance of existing data augmentation methods. To this end, we develop two novel algorithms, termed \\\"AugDrop\\\" and \\\"MixLoss\\\", to correct the data bias in the data augmentation.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021).

We obtain an analytical expression for the drag force that is evaluated in molecular statics and molecular dynamics, extracting the force on a defect directly from the inter-atomic forces. Our results show that a temperature independent drag force arises because vibrations in a discrete crystal are never independent of the defect motion, an implicit assumption in any phonon-based approach. This effect remains even when the Peierls barrier is effectively zero, invalidating qualitative explanations involving the radiation of phonons.

Here, we train four machine-learned force fields for equiatomic NiTi based on the LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN DFT functionals. The models are trained on the fly during NPT molecular dynamics, with DFT calculations and model updates performed automatically whenever the uncertainty of a local energy prediction exceeds a chosen threshold. The models achieve accuracies of 1-2 meV/atom during training and are shown to closely track DFT predictions of B2 and B19' elastic constants and phonon frequencies. Surprisingly, in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, only the SCAN model predicts a reversible B19' -> B2 phase transition, with the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol models predicting a reversible transition to a previously uncharacterized low-volume phase, which we hypothesize to be a new stable high-pressure phase. We examine the structure of the new phase and estimate its stability on the temperature-pressure phase diagram.

For CH$_3$Cl and CH$_3$Br monolayers adsorbed on C$_6$H$_6$, two photodissociation pathways can be identified: neutral photodissociation similar to the gas-phase, and a dissociative electron attachment (DEA) pathway due to photoelectrons from the metal. The same methyl halides adsorbed on a C$_6$F$_6$ thin film display only neutral photodissociation, with the DEA pathway entirely absent due to intermolecular quenching via a LUMO-derived electronic band in the C$_6$F$_6$ thin film. For CH$_3$I adsorbed on a C$_6$F$_6$ thin film, illumination with 248nm light results in CH$_3$ photofragments departing due to neutral photodissociation via the A-band absorption. When CH$_3$I monolayers on C$_6$H$_6$ thin films are illuminated at the same wavelength, additional new photodissociation pathways are observed that are due to absorption in the molecular film with energy transfer leading to dissociation of the CH$_3$I molecules adsorbed on top.

Indium phosphide QDs have emerged as a primary candidate to replace the more toxic CdSe QDs, but production of InP QDs with the desired properties lags behind other QD materials due to a poor understanding of how to tune the growth process. Using high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we report the first direct observation of the early stage intermediates and subsequent formation of an InP cluster from separated indium and phosphorus precursors. In our simulations, indium agglomeration precedes formation of In-P bonds. We observe a predominantly intercomplex pathway in which In-P bonds form between one set of precursor copies while the carboxylate ligand of a second indium precursor in the agglomerated indium abstracts a ligand from the phosphorus precursor. This process produces an indium-rich cluster with structural properties comparable to those in bulk zinc-blende InP crystals. Minimum energy pathway characterization of the AIMD-sampled reaction events confirms these observations and identifies that In-carboxylate dissociation energetics solely determine the barrier along the In-P bond formation pathway, which is lower for intercomplex (13 kcal/mol) than intracomplex (21 kcal/mol) mechanisms. The phosphorus precursor chemistry, on the other hand, controls the thermodynamics of the reaction. Our observations of the differing roles of precursors in controlling QD formation strongly suggests that the challenges thus far encountered in InP QD synthesis optimization may be attributed to an overlooked need for a cooperative tuning strategy that simultaneously addresses the chemistry of both indium and phosphorus precursors.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08565v1\", \"timestamp\": 1451348638, \"domain\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent6", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"c8a9cc73-4f55-4db9-b73f-6c93c8704dd7\", \"authors\": [\"T.

Our results show that a temperature independent drag force arises because vibrations in a discrete crystal are never independent of the defect motion, an implicit assumption in any phonon-based approach. This effect remains even when the Peierls barrier is effectively zero, invalidating qualitative explanations involving the radiation of phonons. We apply our methods to an interstitial defect in tungsten and solitons in the Frenkel-Kontorova model, finding very good agreement with trajectory-based estimations of the thermal drag force.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08731v1\", \"timestamp\": 1435596955, \"domain\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"47671e69-1bfb-4ba4-b145-522a6eedc111\", \"authors\": [\"Jonathan Vandermause\", \"Anders Johansson\", \"Yucong Miao\", \"Joost J.

Here, we train four machine-learned force fields for equiatomic NiTi based on the LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN DFT functionals. The models are trained on the fly during NPT molecular dynamics, with DFT calculations and model updates performed automatically whenever the uncertainty of a local energy prediction exceeds a chosen threshold. The models achieve accuracies of 1-2 meV/atom during training and are shown to closely track DFT predictions of B2 and B19' elastic constants and phonon frequencies. Surprisingly, in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, only the SCAN model predicts a reversible B19' -> B2 phase transition, with the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol models predicting a reversible transition to a previously uncharacterized low-volume phase, which we hypothesize to be a new stable high-pressure phase. We examine the structure of the new phase and estimate its stability on the temperature-pressure phase diagram. This work establishes an automated active learning protocol for studying displacive transformations, reveals important differences between DFT functionals that can only be detected in large-scale simulations, provides an accurate force field for NiTi, and identifies a new phase.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05568v1\", \"timestamp\": 1704925367, \"domain\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"520b3ae8-845e-4854-a8d0-20db429b494b\", \"authors\": [\"Enrico Drigo\", \"Stefano Baroni\", \"Paolo Pegolo\"], \"title\": \"Seebeck coefficient of ionic conductors from Bayesian regression analysis\", \"abstract\": \"We propose a novel approach to evaluating the ionic Seebeck coefficient in electrolytes from relatively short equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, based on the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and Bayesian regression analysis.

Here, we empirically show that variational learning of the inducing points in a molecular descriptor space improves the prediction of energies and atomic forces on two molecular dynamics datasets. First, we show that variational GPs can learn to represent the configurations of the molecules of different types that were not present within the initialization set of configurations. We provide a comparison of alternative log-likelihood training objectives and variational distributions. Among several evaluated approximate marginal log-likelihood objectives, we show that predictive log-likelihood provides excellent uncertainty estimates at the slight expense of predictive quality.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and especially those algorithms that capture graph topology through message passing for neighborhood aggregation, have been a leading solution. However, these networks often require substantial computational resources and may not optimally leverage the information contained in the graph's topology, particularly for large-scale or complex graphs. We propose Topology Coordinate Neural Network (TCNN) and Directional Virtual Coordinate Neural Network (DVCNN) as novel and efficient alternatives to message passing GNNs, that directly leverage the graph's topology, sidestepping the computational challenges presented by competing algorithms. Our proposed methods can be viewed as a reprise of classic techniques for graph embedding for neural network feature engineering, but they are novel in that our embedding techniques leverage ideas in Graph Coordinates (GC) that are lacking in current practice. Experimental results, benchmarked against the Open Graph Benchmark Leaderboard, demonstrate that TCNN and DVCNN achieve competitive or superior performance to message passing GNNs. For similar levels of accuracy and ROC-AUC, TCNN and DVCNN need far fewer trainable parameters than contenders of the OGBN Leaderboard.

This paper aims to connect the dots between the traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well as the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network features at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and stability of the individual node feature learning.

In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events.

This, in turn, can lead to significant improvements in various applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Furthermore, addressing this question can also lead to the development of more efficient and cost-effective machine learning pipelines, which can have a significant impact on industries that rely heavily on data-driven decision-making.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe problem of leveraging unlabeled data in deep learning models is challenging due to several reasons. Firstly, unlabeled data lacks the explicit supervision signal that is typically used to train deep learning models, making it difficult to design effective learning algorithms. Secondly, the quality and relevance of the unlabeled data can significantly impact the performance of the model, and it is often difficult to ensure that the unlabeled data is representative of the underlying distribution. Finally, the lack of labeled data can make it challenging to evaluate the performance of the model, as traditional evaluation metrics may not be applicable.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nDespite significant research efforts in this area, the problem of leveraging unlabeled data in deep learning models remains unsolved due to several limitations and gaps in previous research. Firstly, many existing approaches rely on simplistic assumptions about the distribution of the unlabeled data, which may not hold in practice. Secondly, previous methods often require significant amounts of labeled data to be effective, which may not be available in many scenarios.

This facilitates the generation of high-quality avatars, mitigating issues such as multiple faces, extra limbs, and blurring. The proposed hybrid 3D Gaussian avatar representation builds on the efficient 3D Gaussians, combining neural implicit fields and parameterized 3D meshes to enable real-time rendering, stable SDS optimization, and expressive animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamWaltz-G is highly effective in generating and animating 3D avatars, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and animation expressiveness.

Our key insight is to take advantage of the powerful vision-language model CLIP for supervising neural human generation, in terms of 3D geometry, texture and animation.

Based on the generated 3D human shapes, a volume rendering model is utilized to further facilitate geometry sculpting and texture generation. Moreover, by leveraging the priors learned in the motion VAE, a CLIP-guided reference-based motion synthesis method is proposed for the animation of the generated 3D avatar.

Following previous work, we first integrate a skeleton-driven rigid deformation and a non-rigid cloth dynamics deformation to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation, reconstructing basic avatar with coarse 3D consistency. To improve 3D consistency under sparse inputs, we design Dynamic Avatar Adjustment(DAA) to adjust deformed Gaussians based on a selected similar pose/image from the dataset. Minimizing the difference between the image rendered by adjusted Gaussians and the image with the similar pose serves as an additional form of supervision for avatar.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28]. However, the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The proposed multi-task learning of the binary classification and the metric learning makes it possible to build the feature space where the within-class variance is minimized and the between-class variance is maximized while keeping normal and anomalous classes linearly separable. We also investigate the effectiveness of additionally using anomalous sound data for further improving the binary classification model. Our results showed that multi-task learning using binary classification and metric learning to consider the distance from each class centroid in the feature space is effective, and performance can be significantly improved by using even a small amount of anomalous data during training.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06151v1\", \"timestamp\": 1623382506, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e3492dbe-5a4f-4b75-b19c-9ba4d690e1e0\", \"authors\": [\"Yuma Koizumi\", \"Shoichiro Saito\", \"Hisashi Uematsu\", \"Noboru Harada\", \"Keisuke Imoto\"], \"title\": \"ToyADMOS: A Dataset of Miniature-Machine Operating Sounds for Anomalous Sound Detection\", \"abstract\": \"This paper introduces a new dataset called \\\"ToyADMOS\\\" designed for anomaly detection in machine operating sounds (ADMOS). To the best our knowledge, no large-scale datasets are available for ADMOS, although large-scale datasets have contributed to recent advancements in acoustic signal processing. This is because anomalous sound data are difficult to collect. To build a large-scale dataset for ADMOS, we collected anomalous operating sounds of miniature machines (toys) by deliberately damaging them. The released dataset consists of three sub-datasets for machine-condition inspection, fault diagnosis of machines with geometrically fixed tasks, and fault diagnosis of machines with moving tasks. Each sub-dataset includes over 180 hours of normal machine-operating sounds and over 4,000 samples of anomalous sounds collected with four microphones at a 48-kHz sampling rate.

If these labels are not available, the anomaly score is calculated through outlier detection on the embedding vectors obtained by the activity-detection model. Solving this auxiliary task enables the model to learn the difference between the target machine sounds and similar background noise, which makes it possible to identify small deviations in the target sounds.

Effective anomalous sound detection can also improve the overall efficiency and reliability of industrial machines. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the advancement of unsupervised learning methods and their applications in real-world problems. The proposed solution can also be applied to other domains, such as healthcare and transportation, where anomaly detection is critical.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDetecting anomalous sounds in machine condition monitoring is challenging due to the lack of anomalous sound data, which makes it difficult to train and evaluate machine learning models. Additionally, normal sounds can be diverse and complex, making it hard to define a clear boundary between normal and anomalous sounds. Naive approaches, such as using simple threshold-based methods, may fail due to the complexity of the sound data and the variability of the machines. Furthermore, the problem requires the development of robust and generalizable models that can handle different types of machines and operating conditions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on supervised learning methods, which require large amounts of labeled anomalous sound data. However, collecting such data is challenging and often impractical. Unsupervised learning methods have been proposed, but they often suffer from poor performance due to the lack of anomalous sound data and the diversity of normal sounds. Existing solutions, such as autoencoder-based methods, may not be effective in detecting anomalous sounds, especially in cases where the anomalous sounds are similar to normal sounds. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel unsupervised learning method that can effectively detect anomalous sounds without requiring labeled anomalous sound data.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the development of a novel unsupervised learning method that combines a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network with a machine identity (ID) constraint. The SSDPT network is trained on normal sound data to learn acoustic representations, while the ID constraint is used to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous sounds. We will evaluate our method on the DCASE2021 task2 dataset and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores.

Usually, an acoustic model from an automatic speech recognition system extracts the content representation while an x-vector system extracts the speaker representation. Prior work has shown that the extracted features are not perfectly disentangled. This paper tackles how to improve features disentanglement, and thus the converted anonymized speech. We propose enhancing the disentanglement by removing speaker information from the acoustic model using vector quantization. Evaluation done using the VoicePrivacy 2022 toolkit showed that vector quantization helps conceal the original speaker identity while maintaining utility for speech recognition.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10497v3\", \"timestamp\": 1661154707, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"699b06a0-8bd2-4da4-89d8-90ca8f368ceb\", \"authors\": [\"Taiki Nakamura\", \"Yuki Saito\", \"Shinnosuke Takamichi\", \"Yusuke Ijima\", \"Hiroshi Saruwatari\"], \"title\": \"V2S attack: building DNN-based voice conversion from automatic speaker verification\", \"abstract\": \"This paper presents a new voice impersonation attack using voice conversion (VC).

In addition to the targeted information, these representations usually contain sensitive information about the speaker, like the age, sex, physical state, education level or ethnicity. In order to allow the user to choose which information to protect, we introduce in this paper the concept of attribute-driven privacy preservation in speaker voice representation. It allows a person to hide one or more personal aspects to a potential malicious interceptor and to the application provider.

More concretely, given a specific target speaker, how likely is it to find another person who gets falsely accepted as that target? This question may be addressed empirically by studying naturally confusable pairs of speakers within a large enough corpus. To this end, one might expect to find at least some speaker pairs that are indistinguishable from each other in terms of ASV. To a certain extent, such aim is mirrored in the standardized ASV evaluation benchmarks. However, the number of speakers in such evaluation benchmarks represents only a small fraction of all possible human voices, making it challenging to extrapolate performance beyond a given corpus. Furthermore, the impostors used in performance evaluation are usually selected randomly. A potentially more meaningful definition of an impostor - at least in the context of security-driven ASV applications - would be closest (most confusable) other speaker to a given target.   We put forward a novel performance assessment framework to address both the inadequacy of the random-impostor evaluation model and the size limitation of evaluation corpora by addressing ASV security against closest impostors on arbitrarily large datasets. The framework allows one to make a prediction of the safety of given ASV technology, in its current state, for arbitrarily large speaker database size consisting of virtual (sampled) speakers. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze the performance of two state-of-the-art ASV systems, based on i-vector and x-vector speaker embeddings (as implemented in the popular Kaldi toolkit), on the recent VoxCeleb 1 & 2 corpora.

In addition, we consider 'median', 'furthest', and 'common' targets to serve as a reference points. Our goal is to gain insights how well similarity rankings transfer from the attacker's ASV system to the attacked ASV system, whether the attackers are able to improve their attacks by mimicking, and how the properties of the voices of attackers change due to mimicking. We address these questions through ASV experiments, listening tests, and prosodic and formant analyses. For the ASV experiments, we use i-vector technology in the attacker side, and x-vectors in the attacked side. For the listening tests, we recruit listeners through crowdsourcing. The results of the ASV experiments indicate that the speaker similarity scores transfer well from one ASV system to another. Both the ASV experiments and the listening tests reveal that the mimicry attempts do not, in general, help in bringing attacker's scores closer to the target's. A detailed analysis shows that mimicking does not improve attacks, when the natural voices of attackers and targets are similar to each other. The analysis of prosody and formants suggests that the attackers were able to considerably change their speaking rates when mimicking, but the changes in F0 and formants were modest.

In that study, we presented evidence that both ASV and human observers could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable the presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The interesting cases would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV system, and which a typical listener cannot detect as being a disguise. We carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) crowd-workers. A total of 91 listeners participated in the test and were instructed to estimate both the speaker's chronological and intended age. The results indicate that age estimations for the intended old and child voices for female speakers were towards the target age groups, while for male speakers, the age estimations corresponded to the direction of the target voice only for elderly voices.

These attributes, known as soft biometrics, are private and the user may wish to keep them confidential.

This layer adds Laplace noise for more robust gender concealment and ensures differential privacy guarantees during inference for the output speaker embeddings.

We focus on TTS and VC that represent the most flexible, high-end spoofing attacks. Most of the prior studies on synthesized or converted speech detection report their findings using high-quality clean recordings.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

The diverse property of graphs has imposed significant challenges on existing graph learning techniques since diverse graphs have different best-fit hyperparameters. It is difficult to learn graph features from a set of diverse graphs by a unified graph neural network. This motivates us to use a multiplex structure in a diverse way and utilize a priori properties of graphs to guide the learning.

In this work, we propose a novel mixup-based graph augmentation method, Graph Dual Mixup (GDM), that leverages both functional and structural information of the graph instances to generate new labeled graph samples. GDM employs a graph structural auto-encoder to learn structural embeddings of the graph samples, and then applies mixup to the structural information of the graphs in the learned structural embedding space and generates new graph structures from the mixup structural embeddings. As for the functional information, GDM applies mixup directly to the input node features of the graph samples to generate functional node feature information for new mixup graph instances. Jointly, the generated input node features and graph structures yield new graph samples which can supplement the set of original labeled graphs.

Our experimental results indicate consistent improvements in out-of-domain graph data transfer compared to state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning methods, shedding light on how to design a graph learner that is able to learn structural properties common to diverse graph types.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02909v1\", \"timestamp\": 1675700789, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"4df520f1-cdfc-4736-9301-75dfdce67999\", \"authors\": [\"Falih Gozi Febrinanto\", \"Feng Xia\", \"Kristen Moore\", \"Chandra Thapa\", \"Charu Aggarwal\"], \"title\": \"Graph Lifelong Learning: A Survey\", \"abstract\": \"Graph learning is a popular approach for performing machine learning on graph-structured data. It has revolutionized the machine learning ability to model graph data to address downstream tasks. Its application is wide due to the availability of graph data ranging from all types of networks to information systems. Most graph learning methods assume that the graph is static and its complete structure is known during training. This limits their applicability since they cannot be applied to problems where the underlying graph grows over time and/or new tasks emerge incrementally. Such applications require a lifelong learning approach that can learn the graph continuously and accommodate new information whilst retaining previously learned knowledge. Lifelong learning methods that enable continuous learning in regular domains like images and text cannot be directly applied to continuously evolving graph data, due to its irregular structure. As a result, graph lifelong learning is gaining attention from the research community. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in graph lifelong learning, including the categorization of existing methods, and the discussions of potential applications and open research problems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10688v2\", \"timestamp\": 1645510447, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we develop a robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data, such as noise and sparsity, and effectively learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of graph structure learning, as it can lead to more accurate and reliable graph representations, which are essential for various downstream tasks, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. A robust graph structure learning framework can also enable the analysis of complex graph-structured data in various domains, such as social networks, recommender systems, and biological networks. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the development of more effective graph neural networks (GNNs) and other graph-based machine learning models.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping a robust graph structure learning framework is challenging due to the complexity and variability of graph-structured data. Graphs can have different sizes, structures, and properties, making it difficult to design a single framework that can effectively learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Additionally, graph data can be noisy and sparse, which can compromise the reliability of the learned graph structures. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to capture the complex relationships within the data, and may not be able to adapt to the variability of graph-structured data. Technical obstacles include the need to develop effective methods for handling noise and sparsity, and for learning graph structures that are robust to these imperfections.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research on graph structure learning has focused on developing methods that rely on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, these methods may not be effective in the presence of noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of the learned graph structures. Additionally, previous methods may not be able to adapt to the variability of graph-structured data, and may not be able to capture the complex relationships within the data. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. We plan to develop a framework that can effectively learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, and that can be applied to various graph-structured data domains.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the development of a robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. The key components of our approach include:\n\n* A novel graph structure learning algorithm that can effectively learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, even in the presence of noise and sparsity.\n* A method for handling noise and sparsity in graph-structured data, which can improve the reliability of the learned graph structures.\n* A framework for adapting to the variability of graph-structured data, which can enable the application of our method to various graph-structured data domains.\n\nWe plan to evaluate our approach using various graph-structured data benchmarks, and to compare our results with state-of-the-art graph structure learning methods. We expect our approach to outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, and to provide a more effective framework for graph structure learning in the presence of data imperfections.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 81728, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 6, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 3}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere. Aurora can produce forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric forecasting problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events.

A robust foundation model can help mitigate the impacts of climate change, improve air quality, and enhance decision-making in various fields such as agriculture, transportation, and emergency management. This research can also contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable forecasting systems, which can have significant economic and social benefits.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping a robust foundation model for atmospheric forecasting is challenging due to the complexity and variability of atmospheric data. The model must be able to handle diverse and heterogeneous data, including extreme events, limited training data, and non-linear relationships between variables. Additionally, the model must be able to generalize well to new and unseen data, which can be difficult to achieve with traditional machine learning approaches. Furthermore, the model must be computationally efficient and scalable to handle large datasets and high-resolution forecasting tasks.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing specialized models for specific forecasting tasks, which can be limited in their ability to generalize to new and diverse data. Existing foundation models have also struggled to handle extreme events and limited training data, which can lead to poor performance and robustness issues. Additionally, previous approaches have often relied on traditional machine learning techniques, which can be limited in their ability to capture complex and non-linear relationships between variables. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging the strengths of foundation models and developing a more robust and generalizable approach that can effectively handle diverse and heterogeneous data.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach involves developing a new foundation model for atmospheric forecasting that leverages the strengths of transformer-based architectures and 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. We will pretrain the model on a large and diverse dataset of atmospheric data, including extreme events and limited training data. We will then fine-tune the model using a two-stage approach, including short-lead time fine-tuning and long-lead time fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We will evaluate the performance of the model using a range of metrics, including accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION Neural networks are mathematical models that simulate the way neurons operate in the brain. The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5].

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5].

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning.

It\npaves the way for sophisticated multimodal integration inhuman-centered computing, setting a benchmark for handling\ncomplex, varied datasets with enhanced accuracy.\nAdopting a human-centered approach to segment the dataset\ninto four modalities demonstrates potential enhancements in\nmodel performance. Particularly, models employing CNN-\nAttention mechanisms exhibit slight but positive differences,\nsuggesting an improved capability in capturing pain behavior\nfeatures. This indicates that modality segmentation, guided by\nhuman-centered principles, can amplify model effectiveness.\nFurther analysis reveals that models employing statistical\nweighting generally outperform those using mean weighting,\nexcept in the case of LSTM with four modalities employing\naverage weighting\u2014a scenario that mirrors the trade-offs\nobserved in single-modality LSTM models.\nThis investigation emphasizes the advantage of multimodal\nstrategies, where strategic feature grouping and statistical\ndecision-making markedly elevate model efficacy. Our findings\nparticularly highlight the utility of attention mechanisms, like\nCNN-Attention and CNN with Multi-head Self-Attention, in a\nfour-modality framework, reinforcing the benefits of human-\ncentered modality segmentation. Overall, the transition to a\nfour-modality model, grounded in human-centered design and\nstatistical weighting, is validated as superior to single-modality\napproaches, bolstering the case for sophisticated multimodal\nfusion in enhancing protective behavior recognition.\nThe examination distinctly emphasizes the superiority of\nstatistical weighting over average weighting in multimodal\nconfigurations, enhancing model performance.

A more effective multimodal fusion approach can lead to improved accuracy and reliability in protective behavior detection, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals with chronic pain. This research can also contribute to the development of more sophisticated multimodal integration techniques, paving the way for future research in human-centered computing.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping an effective multimodal fusion approach for protective behavior detection is challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modalities, such as body joint coordinates, surface electromyography data, and protective behavior labels. Naive approaches may fail to capture the nuanced relationships between these modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the dataset used in this research, EmoPain, presents challenges due to its limited size and the variability in pain intensity levels among participants.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on single-modality approaches or simplistic multimodal fusion techniques, which may not fully capture the complexity of protective behavior detection. The introduction of human-centered modality segmentation and statistical weighting presents a new opportunity to address this problem. However, the lack of a comprehensive framework for integrating these techniques has hindered progress in this area. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a more sophisticated multimodal fusion approach that leverages the strengths of human-centered modality segmentation and statistical weighting.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components:\n\n1. **Dataset**: We will use the EmoPain dataset, which includes body joint coordinates, surface electromyography data, and protective behavior labels.\n2. **Modality Segmentation**: We will employ a human-centered approach to segment the dataset into four modalities, guided by the principles of human-centered design.\n3. **Statistical Weighting**: We will use statistical weighting techniques to integrate the modalities, leveraging the strengths of each modality to improve overall performance.\n4. **Multimodal Fusion**: We will develop a sophisticated multimodal fusion approach that combines the segmented modalities and statistical weighting techniques.\n5. **Evaluation Metrics**: We will evaluate the performance of our approach using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.\n\nExpected outcomes include:\n\n1. Improved accuracy and reliability in protective behavior detection.\n2. Enhanced understanding of the relationships between body joint coordinates, surface electromyography data, and protective behavior labels.\n3.

\n\n1 Introduction\n\nDeep probabilistic State Space Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries.

Adversarial Training (AT) has been considered to be the most successful adversarial defense approach. Nevertheless, conventional AT requires ground-truth labels to generate adversarial examples and train models, which limits its effectiveness in the unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we aim to explore AT to robustify UDA models: How to enhance the unlabeled data robustness via AT while learning domain-invariant features for UDA? To answer this question, we provide a systematic study into multiple AT variants that can potentially be applied to UDA.

To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for segmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf\\\" segmentation model pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g., self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods with the source data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12497v1\", \"timestamp\": 1624465015, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7b2e807e-8b15-4699-aabb-2ddc07a3d363\", \"authors\": [\"Shaoduo Gan\", \"Akhil Mathur\", \"Anton Isopoussu\", \"Fahim Kawsar\", \"Nadia Berthouze\", \"Nicholas Lane\"], \"title\": \"FRuDA: Framework for Distributed Adversarial Domain Adaptation\", \"abstract\": \"Breakthroughs in unsupervised domain adaptation (uDA) can help in adapting models from a label-rich source domain to unlabeled target domains.

In this work, we leverage intermediate representations learned by multiple robust ImageNet models to improve the robustness of UDA models. Our method works by aligning the features of the UDA model with the robust features learned by ImageNet pre-trained models along with domain adaptation training.

Adversarial Training (AT) has been considered to be the most successful adversarial defense approach.

However, trained source models may also be unavailable in practice since source models may have commercial values and exposing source models brings risks to the source domain, e.g., problems of model misuse and white-box attacks.

Our bound shows the insufficiency of minimizing source domain error and marginal distribution mismatch for a guaranteed reduction in the target domain error, due to the possible increase of induced labeling function mismatch. This insufficiency is further illustrated through simple distributions for which the same UDA approach succeeds, fails, and may succeed or fail with an equal chance. Motivated from this, we propose novel data poisoning attacks to fool UDA methods into learning representations that produce large target domain errors. We evaluate the effect of these attacks on popular UDA methods using benchmark datasets where they have been previously shown to be successful. Our results show that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy, dropping it to almost 0% in some cases, with the addition of only 10% poisoned data in the source domain.

A successful solution can also pave the way for the development of more robust and efficient unlearning methods for other machine learning models.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping an effective machine unlearning method for LLMs is challenging due to the complexity of these models and the vast amount of data they are trained on. Naive approaches, such as retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples, are computationally expensive and may not be feasible for large models. Additionally, existing unlearning methods may not be effective for LLMs, and new approaches need to be developed to address the specific challenges of these models. The problem also requires a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of LLMs and the impact of unlearning on their performance and robustness.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research on machine unlearning has focused on smaller models and simpler tasks, and the existing methods may not be effective for large language models. The complexity of LLMs and the vast amount of data they are trained on make it challenging to develop an effective unlearning method. Additionally, the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of LLMs and the impact of unlearning on their performance and robustness has hindered the development of effective unlearning methods. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel unlearning method specifically designed for LLMs, which takes into account the unique challenges and complexities of these models.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel machine unlearning method for LLMs, which we call Adaptive Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (ARMU). ARMU is an extension of the Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU) method, which has shown promising results in mitigating unforeseen risks in LLMs. However, RMU has limitations, such as failing to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient. ARMU addresses this limitation by adaptively adjusting the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of ARMU using a range of metrics, including the drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, the performance on general knowledge, and the adversarial robustness of the model. We expect ARMU to achieve higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintain high performance on general knowledge, and enable effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 76523, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 3, "agent6": 1}, "total_milestones": 3, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 3, "feasibility": 4}}

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications.

Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on.

By developing a more effective alignment method, we can improve the quality and diversity of generated images, leading to more practical and useful applications. This research can also contribute to the broader understanding of human preferences and values in AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThis problem is challenging because it requires balancing the alignment of the model with human preferences while maintaining output diversity. The reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, commonly used in existing methods, can lead to mode-seeking behavior, reducing diversity in generated outputs. Developing a new approach that addresses this issue while ensuring effective alignment is a complex task. Additionally, evaluating the success of such a method is difficult due to the subjective nature of human preferences.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on using the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, which has limitations in maintaining output diversity. While some studies have explored alternative divergence constraints, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence, these approaches have not been thoroughly investigated in the context of text-to-image generation. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that incorporates multiple divergence constraints to achieve a better balance between alignment and diversity.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new framework that integrates multiple divergence constraints, including Jensen-Shannon divergence, to align text-to-image models with human preferences. We will use a combination of datasets, including the existing datasets used in previous studies, and new datasets that we will collect to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our evaluation metrics will include both quantitative measures, such as image quality and diversity, and qualitative assessments, such as human preference ratings.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill.

This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution.

If we can learn the correspondences between the sensorimotor spaces of different robots, we can expect a skill that is learned in one robot can be more directly and easily transferred to other robots. In this paper, we propose a method to learn correspondences among two or more robots that may have different morphologies. To be specific, besides robots with similar morphologies with different degrees of freedom, we show that a fixed-based manipulator robot with joint control and a differential drive mobile robot can be addressed within the proposed framework. To set up the correspondence among the robots considered, an initial base task is demonstrated to the robots to achieve the same goal. Then, a common latent representation is learned along with the individual robot policies for achieving the goal. After the initial learning stage, the observation of a new task execution by one robot becomes sufficient to generate a latent space representation pertaining to the other robots to achieve the same task. We verified our system in a set of experiments where the correspondence between robots is learned (1) when the robots need to follow the same paths to achieve the same task, (2) when the robots need to follow different trajectories to achieve the same task, and (3) when complexities of the required sensorimotor trajectories are different for the robots.

PARL implements data collaboration with the framework of cloud robotic systems. Both data and models are shared by robots to the cloud after semantic computing and training locally. The cloud converges the data and performs augmentation, integration, and transferring. Finally, fine tune this larger shared dataset in the cloud to local robots. Furthermore, we propose the DAT Network (Data Augmentation and Transferring Network) to implement the data processing in PARL. DAT Network can realize the augmentation of data from multi-local robots. We conduct experiments on a simplified self-driving task for robots (cars). DAT Network has a significant improvement in the augmentation in self-driving scenarios. Along with this, the self-driving experimental results also demonstrate that PARL is capable of improving learning effects with data collaboration of local robots.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08303v1\", \"timestamp\": 1602845574, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f413beae-3c9c-46f3-a223-82f649cd736a\", \"authors\": [\"Hakan Aktas\", \"Yukie Nagai\", \"Minoru Asada\", \"Erhan Oztop\", \"Emre Ugur\"], \"title\": \"Correspondence learning between morphologically different robots via task demonstrations\", \"abstract\": \"We observe a large variety of robots in terms of their bodies, sensors, and actuators. Given the commonalities in the skill sets, teaching each skill to each different robot independently is inefficient and not scalable when the large variety in the robotic landscape is considered.

In this paper, we propose a method to learn correspondences among two or more robots that may have different morphologies. To be specific, besides robots with similar morphologies with different degrees of freedom, we show that a fixed-based manipulator robot with joint control and a differential drive mobile robot can be addressed within the proposed framework. To set up the correspondence among the robots considered, an initial base task is demonstrated to the robots to achieve the same goal. Then, a common latent representation is learned along with the individual robot policies for achieving the goal. After the initial learning stage, the observation of a new task execution by one robot becomes sufficient to generate a latent space representation pertaining to the other robots to achieve the same task. We verified our system in a set of experiments where the correspondence between robots is learned (1) when the robots need to follow the same paths to achieve the same task, (2) when the robots need to follow different trajectories to achieve the same task, and (3) when complexities of the required sensorimotor trajectories are different for the robots.

Our setup allows the agent to learn this safety-critical task (i) without safety constraints in the algorithm, (ii) while maximizing the speed of returned balls directly in the reward function (iii) using a stochastic policy that acts directly on the low-level controls of the real system and (iv) trains for thousands of trials (v) from scratch without any prior knowledge. Additionally, we present HYSR, a practical hybrid sim and real training that avoids playing real balls during training by randomly replaying recorded ball trajectories in simulation and applying actions to the real robot. This work is the first to (a) fail-safe learn of a safety-critical dynamic task using anthropomorphic robot arms, (b) learn a precision-demanding problem with a PAM-driven system despite the control challenges and (c) train robots to play table tennis without real balls.

An accurate return therefore has to be found depending on a high-dimensional continuous state space. To make learning in few trials possible the method is embedded into our robot system. In this way we can use a one-step environment. The state space depends on the ball at hitting time (position, velocity, spin) and the action is the racket state (orientation, velocity) at hitting. An actor-critic based deterministic policy gradient algorithm was developed for accelerated learning.

One of these challenges is that the autonomous agent does not have an accurate model tailored to the specific human that the autonomous agent is interacting with, which could sometimes result in inefficient human-robot interaction and suboptimal system dynamics. Developing an online method to enable the autonomous agent to learn information about the human model is therefore an ongoing research goal. Existing approaches position the robot as a passive learner in the environment to observe the physical states and the associated human response. This passive design, however, only allows the robot to obtain information that the human chooses to exhibit, which sometimes doesn't capture the human's full intention. In this work, we present an online optimization-based probing procedure for the autonomous agent to clarify its belief about the human model in an active manner. By optimizing an information radius, the autonomous agent chooses the action that most challenges its current conviction. This procedure allows the autonomous agent to actively probe the human agents to reveal information that's previously unavailable to the autonomous agent. With this gathered information, the autonomous agent can interactively influence the human agent for some designated objectives.

However, some collaborative robots sacrifice precision for safety, particular for high motion speed. The performance degradation is caused by the inability of the joint servo controller to address the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the robot arm, e.g., due to joint flexibility. We consider two approaches to improve the trajectory tracking performance through feedforward compensation. The first approach uses iterative learning control, with the gradient-based iterative update generated from the robot forward dynamics model. The second approach uses dynamic inversion to directly compensate for the robot forward dynamics. If the forward dynamics is strictly proper or is non-minimum-phase (e.g., due to time delays), its stable inverse would be non-causal. Both approaches require robot dynamical models. This paper presents results of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to approximate these dynamical models-forward dynamics in the first case, inverse dynamics (possibly non-causal) in the second case. We use the bi-directional RNN to capture the noncausality. The RNNs are trained based on a collection of commanded trajectories and the actual robot responses. We use a Baxter robot to evaluate the two approaches. The Baxter robot exhibits significant joint flexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators. Both approaches achieve sizable improvement over the uncompensated robot motion, for both random joint trajectories and Cartesian motion.

Most industrial robot motion controllers allow externally commanded motion profile, but the trajectory tracking performance is affected by the robot dynamics and joint servo controllers which users have no direct access and little information. The performance is further compromised by time delays in transmitting the external command as a setpoint to the inner control loop. This paper presents an approach of combining neural networks and iterative learning control to improve the trajectory tracking performance for a multi-axis articulated industrial robot. For a given desired trajectory, the external command is iteratively refined using a high fidelity dynamical simulator to compensate for the robot inner loop dynamics. These desired trajectories and the corresponding refined input trajectories are then used to train multi-layer neural networks to emulate the dynamical inverse of the nonlinear inner loop dynamics. We show that with a sufficiently rich training set, the trained neural networks can generalize well to trajectories beyond the training set. In applying the trained neural networks to the physical robot, the tracking performance still improves but not as much as in the simulator. We show that transfer learning can effectively bridge the gap between simulation and the physical robot.

It includes typical applications and challenges of human-robot interaction, fundamental tasks of robot manipulation and one of the most widely used formulations of robot manipulation, Markov Decision Process. Recent research focusing on robot manipulation is mainly based on Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. This review paper shows the importance of Deep Reinforcement Learning, which plays an important role in manipulating robots to complete complex tasks in disturbed and unfamiliar environments. With the introduction of Imitation Learning, it is possible for robot manipulation to get rid of reward function design and achieve a simple, stable and supervised learning process. This paper reviews and compares the main features and popular algorithms for both Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04687v1\", \"timestamp\": 1694237979, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"773f196d-238c-438a-b5b5-60bc73c96de8\", \"authors\": [\"Jangwon Lee\"], \"title\": \"A survey of robot learning from demonstrations for Human-Robot Collaboration\", \"abstract\": \"Robot learning from demonstration (LfD) is a research paradigm that can play an important role in addressing the issue of scaling up robot learning.

There is a growing body of literature that employ LfD approach for training robots. In this paper, I present a survey of recent research in this area while focusing on studies for human-robot collaborative tasks. Since there are different aspects between stand-alone tasks and collaborative tasks, researchers should consider these differences to design collaborative robots for more effective and natural human-robot collaboration (HRC). In this regard, many researchers have shown an increased interest in to make better communication framework between robots and humans because communication is a key issue to apply LfD paradigm for human-robot collaboration.

The acronym of the project stands both for \\\"Society of Robots\\\" and \\\"Soccer Robots\\\", the case study where we are testing our population of robots. Designing soccer robots is a very challenging problem, where the robots must act not only to shoot a ball towards the goal, but also to detect and avoid static (walls, stopped robots) and dynamic (moving robots) obstacles. Furthermore, they must cooperate to defeat an opposing team.

A robot that can play competitive table tennis at a human level could be used in various applications, such as sports, entertainment, and education, and could also serve as a platform for researching human-robot interaction and collaboration. Furthermore, the development of such a robot could lead to breakthroughs in areas like computer vision, machine learning, and control systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThis problem is hard because it requires the integration of multiple complex components, including computer vision, machine learning, control systems, and human-robot interaction. The robot must be able to track the ball in real-time, predict its trajectory, and adjust its movements accordingly, all while taking into account the opponent's actions and the game's rules. Additionally, the robot must be able to learn from its experiences and adapt to new situations, which requires advanced machine learning algorithms and a large amount of training data. The problem is also challenging because it requires the robot to operate in a dynamic and unpredictable environment, where the ball's movement and the opponent's actions are uncertain and subject to change.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nDespite significant advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, this problem has not been solved before because of the complexity and difficulty of the task. Previous attempts at building table tennis robots have been limited to simple tasks, such as returning the ball to the opponent's side, and have not been able to achieve human-level performance. The main barriers to solving this problem have been the lack of advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the difficulty of integrating multiple complex components, and the challenge of operating in a dynamic and unpredictable environment. Our approach differs from prior work in that it uses a hierarchical and modular policy architecture, which allows the robot to learn and adapt to new situations more effectively.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur approach consists of the following key components:\n\n1. A hierarchical and modular policy architecture, which allows the robot to learn and adapt to new situations more effectively.\n2. Advanced computer vision algorithms, which enable the robot to track the ball in real-time and predict its trajectory.\n3. Machine learning algorithms, which allow the robot to learn from its experiences and adapt to new situations.\n4. A control system, which enables the robot to adjust its movements accordingly and take into account the opponent's actions and the game's rules.\n5. A human-robot interaction system, which enables the robot to interact with the opponent and the game environment in a natural and intuitive way.\n\nOur expected outcomes include:\n\n1. A robot that can play competitive table tennis at a human level, taking into account the complexities of the game.\n2. A hierarchical and modular policy architecture that can be applied to other complex tasks and domains.\n3. Advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms that can be used in a variety of applications.\n4. A control system that can be used in other dynamic and unpredictable environments.\n5.

These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022).

These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), BART (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022; Ni et\u00a0al., 2021; Pradeep et\u00a0al., 2023a).

In many humanitarian efforts, translation into severely low-resource languages often does not require a universal translation engine, but a dedicated text-specific translation engine. For example, healthcare records, hygienic procedures, government communication, emergency procedures and religious texts are all limited texts. While generic translation engines for all languages do not exist, translation of multilingually known limited texts into new, low-resource languages may be possible and reduce human translation effort. We attempt to leverage translation resources from rich-resource languages to efficiently produce best possible translation quality for well known texts, which are available in multiple languages, in a new, low-resource language. To reach this goal, we argue that in translating a closed text into low-resource languages, generalization to out-of-domain texts is not necessary, but generalization to new languages is. Performance gain comes from massive source parallelism by careful choice of close-by language families, style-consistent corpus-level paraphrases within the same language and strategic adaptation of existing large pretrained multilingual models to the domain first and then to the language.

More recently, the advent of multilingual pre-trained language models provides great support for designing neural cross-lingual retrieval models. However, due to unbalanced pre-training data in different languages, multilingual language models have already shown a performance gap between high and low-resource languages in many downstream tasks. And cross-lingual retrieval models built on such pre-trained models can inherit language bias, leading to suboptimal result for low-resource languages. Moreover, unlike the English-to-English retrieval task, where large-scale training collections for document ranking such as MS MARCO are available, the lack of cross-lingual retrieval data for low-resource language makes it more challenging for training cross-lingual retrieval models. In this work, we propose OPTICAL: Optimal Transport distillation for low-resource Cross-lingual information retrieval. To transfer a model from high to low resource languages, OPTICAL forms the cross-lingual token alignment task as an optimal transport problem to learn from a well-trained monolingual retrieval model. By separating the cross-lingual knowledge from knowledge of query document matching, OPTICAL only needs bitext data for distillation training, which is more feasible for low-resource languages.

In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a RAG-based information search setting.

However, updating their knowledge poses challenges, potentially leading to inaccuracies when confronted with unfamiliar queries. To address this issue, integrating external knowledge bases such as knowledge graphs with large language models is a viable approach. The key challenge lies in extracting the required knowledge from knowledge graphs based on natural language, demanding high semantic understanding. Therefore, researchers are considering leveraging large language models directly for knowledge retrieval from these graphs. Current efforts typically rely on the comprehensive problem-solving capabilities of large language models. We argue that a problem we term the 'information black box' can significantly impact the practical effectiveness of such methods. Moreover, this kind of methods is less effective for scenarios where the questions are unfamiliar to the large language models. In this paper, we propose a Clue-Guided Path Exploration (CGPE) framework to optimize knowledge retrieval based on large language models. By addressing the 'information black box' issue and employing single-task approaches instead of complex tasks, we have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of using large language models for retrieving knowledge graphs. Experiments on open-source datasets reveal that CGPE outperforms previous methods and is highly applicable to LLMs with fewer parameters. In some instances, even ChatGLM3, with its 6 billion parameters, can rival the performance of GPT-4. Furthermore, the results indicate a minimal invocation frequency of CGPE on LLMs, suggesting reduced computational overhead.

Because the syntax of programming languages is by design determined by phrase structure grammars, neural models that produce syntactic code are apparently uninformative about the theoretical foundations of programming languages. The demonstration that neural models perform well on tasks that involve clearly symbolic systems, proves that they cannot be used as an argument that language and other cognitive systems are not symbolic. Finally, we argue as a corollary that the term language model is misleading and propose the adoption of the working term corpus model instead, which better reflects the genesis and contents of the model.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07055v2\", \"timestamp\": 1639435186, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0dd3a016-5e6d-4b92-a622-e47f599eb7f7\", \"authors\": [\"Harsh Patel\"], \"title\": \"HinFlair: pre-trained contextual string embeddings for pos tagging and text classification in the Hindi language\", \"abstract\": \"Recent advancements in language models based on recurrent neural networks and transformers architecture have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as pos tagging, named entity recognition, and text classification.

This, in turn, can lead to practical applications such as improved language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization for low-resource languages. Furthermore, addressing this problem can also contribute to the preservation and promotion of linguistic diversity, which is essential for maintaining cultural heritage and promoting global understanding.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping a method for training large language models to adapt to low-resource languages is challenging due to several reasons. Firstly, low-resource languages often lack large amounts of annotated training data, which is essential for training effective language models. Secondly, linguistic diversity and complexity can make it difficult to develop models that can effectively capture the nuances of different languages. Finally, existing methods for training language models may not be effective for low-resource languages, and may require significant modifications or new approaches to address the challenges of linguistic diversity and complexity.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused primarily on developing language models for high-resource languages, and has often overlooked the challenges of linguistic diversity and complexity. Existing methods for training language models may not be effective for low-resource languages, and may require significant modifications or new approaches to address the challenges of linguistic diversity and complexity. Furthermore, the lack of annotated training data for low-resource languages has made it difficult to develop effective language models for these languages.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach involves developing a novel method for training large language models to adapt to low-resource languages, using a combination of transfer learning, meta-learning, and data augmentation techniques. We will use a large corpus of text data from high-resource languages to pre-train the model, and then fine-tune it on a smaller corpus of text data from the target low-resource language. We will also use data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of the training data for the low-resource language. Our expected outcomes include improved performance on language modeling tasks for low-resource languages, as well as increased linguistic diversity and complexity in the generated text. We will evaluate our approach using a range of metrics, including perplexity, accuracy, and fluency, and will compare our results to existing state-of-the-art methods for training language models.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 129817, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 3, "agent4": 6, "agent5": 6}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios.

This habilitation elaborates on aspects related to these three notions in the light of recommender systems, namely: (i) transparency and cognitive models, (ii) privacy and limited preference information, and (iii) fairness and popularity bias in recommender systems. Specifically, with respect to aspect (i), we highlight the usefulness of incorporating psychological theories for a transparent design process of recommender systems. We term this type of systems psychology-informed recommender systems. In aspect (ii), we study and address the trade-off between accuracy and privacy in differentially-private recommendations. We design a novel recommendation approach for collaborative filtering based on an efficient neighborhood reuse concept, which reduces the number of users that need to be protected with differential privacy. Furthermore, we address the related issue of limited availability of user preference information, e.g., click data, in the settings of session-based and cold-start recommendations. With respect to aspect (iii), we analyze popularity bias in recommender systems. We find that the recommendation frequency of an item is positively correlated with this item's popularity.

Recommender systems are widely used in various applications, including e-commerce, news, and entertainment platforms, and their performance directly affects user experience and business outcomes. A recommender system that balances efficacy and efficiency can lead to improved user satisfaction, increased engagement, and ultimately, revenue growth. Furthermore, addressing this problem can advance knowledge in the field of recommender systems, particularly in the areas of multi-stage ranking and efficiency optimization.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDesigning a recommender system that balances efficacy and efficiency is challenging due to the inherent trade-off between these two objectives. On one hand, complex models can provide high-quality recommendations but are often computationally expensive and may not be suitable for real-time deployment. On the other hand, simple models may be efficient but lack the capacity to capture complex user preferences and item relationships. Additionally, the problem is further complicated by the need to consider multiple stages in the ranking process, each with its own unique characteristics and requirements. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to capture these complexities, and technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles, such as scalability, interpretability, and data sparsity, need to be overcome.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on optimizing either efficacy or efficiency in isolation, but not both simultaneously. Existing solutions often rely on simplistic models or heuristics that may not capture the complexities of user behavior and item relationships. Furthermore, the problem of multi-stage ranking has not been thoroughly addressed, and existing approaches may not be scalable or interpretable. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that integrates multiple stages of ranking and optimizes both efficacy and efficiency simultaneously. We also plan to leverage recent advances in machine learning and optimization techniques to develop a more effective and efficient recommender system.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach involves the following key components:\n\n1. **Multi-stage ranking framework**: We will develop a novel framework that integrates multiple stages of ranking, including retrieval, pre-ranking, and re-ranking.\n2. **Efficiency optimization**: We will employ optimization techniques, such as pruning and caching, to reduce computational costs and improve efficiency.\n3. **Efficacy optimization**: We will use machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and gradient boosting, to optimize the ranking model and improve efficacy.\n4. **Dataset and metrics**: We will use a large-scale dataset from a real-world e-commerce platform and evaluate our approach using metrics such as precision, recall, and A/B testing.\n5. **Expected outcomes**: We expect our approach to outperform existing solutions in terms of both efficacy and efficiency, leading to improved user satisfaction and revenue growth.\n\nOur expected results include:\n\n* A significant improvement in recommendation quality, measured by precision and recall, compared to existing solutions.\n* A substantial reduction in computational costs and latency, measured by response time and resource utilization.\n* A comprehensive evaluation of our approach using A/B testing and user feedback, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 135843, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 6, "agent4": 3, "agent5": 6}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

In most previous work, adversarial deep learning was formulated as a simultaneous game and the strategy spaces are assumed to be certain probability distributions in order for the Nash equilibrium to exist. But, this assumption is not applicable to the practical situation. In this paper, we give answers to these basic questions for the practical case where the classifiers are DNNs with a given structure, by formulating the adversarial deep learning as sequential games. The existence of Stackelberg equilibria for these games are proved.

This is particularly important in applications where accuracy and reliability are critical, such as in healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. By addressing this problem, we can also gain a deeper understanding of how deep learning models work and how they can be improved.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThis problem is challenging because deep learning models are prone to learning spurious correlations in the data, which can lead to poor generalization performance. In cases where concepts are not spatially separable, it can be difficult to develop models that can effectively capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Additionally, the lack of annotated subgroup data can make it difficult to develop models that can learn to recognize and mitigate spurious correlations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing models that can learn to recognize and mitigate spurious correlations in cases where concepts are spatially separable. However, these models may not generalize well to cases where concepts are not spatially separable. Additionally, previous research has often relied on annotated subgroup data, which may not be available in all cases. Our approach differs from previous work in that we propose to develop a model that can learn to recognize and mitigate spurious correlations in cases where concepts are not spatially separable, without relying on annotated subgroup data.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur approach involves developing a deep learning model that can learn to recognize and mitigate spurious correlations in image classification tasks. We propose to use a combination of self-supervised learning and concept discovery to develop a model that can effectively capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. We will evaluate our model on a range of datasets, including CMNIST and CelebA, and compare its performance to state-of-the-art models.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

In contrast to the source-agnostic approach of conventional wireless communication systems, semantic communication seeks to ensure that only the relevant information for the underlying task is communicated to the receiver. Considering that most semantic communication applications have strict latency, bandwidth, and power constraints, a prominent approach is to model them as a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem. Although JSCC has been a long-standing open problem in communication and coding theory, remarkable performance gains have been shown recently over existing separate source and channel coding systems, particularly in low-latency and low-power scenarios. Recent progress is thanks to the adoption of deep learning techniques for joint source-channel code design that outperform the concatenation of state-of-the-art compression and channel coding schemes, which are results of decades-long research efforts.

Our results show that the proposed deep JSCC scheme outperforms digital transmission concatenating JPEG or JPEG2000 compression with a capacity achieving channel code at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel bandwidth values in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

These methods, we call nonlinear transform source-channel coding (NTSCC), extract the semantic latent features of source signal, and learn entropy model to guide the joint source-channel coding with variable rate to transmit latent features over wireless channels. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for improving NTSCC, thereby higher system coding gain, better model versatility, and more flexible adaptation strategy aligned with semantic guidance are all achieved. This new sophisticated NTSCC model is now ready to support large-size data interaction in emerging XR, which catalyzes the application of semantic communications. Specifically, we propose three useful improvement approaches. First, we introduce a contextual entropy model to better capture the spatial correlations among the semantic latent features, thereby more accurate rate allocation and contextual joint source-channel coding are developed accordingly to enable higher coding gain. On that basis, we further propose response network architectures to formulate versatile NTSCC, i.e., once-trained model supports various rates and channel states that benefits the practical deployment. Following this, we propose an online latent feature editing method to enable more flexible coding rate control aligned with some specific semantic guidance. By comprehensively applying the above three improvement methods for NTSCC, a deployment-friendly semantic coded transmission system stands out finally.

The idea is to map similar source samples to nearby points in the channel input space such that, despite the noise introduced by the channel, the input can be recovered with minimal distortion. In DeepJSCC, this is achieved by an autoencoder architecture with a non-trainable channel layer between the encoder and decoder. DeepJSCC has many favorable properties, such as better end-to-end distortion performance than its separate source and channel coding counterpart as well as graceful degradation with respect to channel quality. However, due to the inherent correlation between the source sample and channel input, DeepJSCC is vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we propose the first DeepJSCC scheme for wireless image transmission that is secure against eavesdroppers, called DeepJSCEC. DeepJSCEC not only preserves the favorable properties of DeepJSCC, it also provides security against chosen-plaintext attacks from the eavesdropper, without the need to make assumptions about the eavesdropper's channel condition, or its intended use of the intercepted signal. Numerical results show that DeepJSCEC achieves similar or better image quality than separate source coding using BPG compression, AES encryption, and LDPC codes for channel coding, while preserving the graceful degradation of image quality with respect to channel quality. We also show that the proposed encryption method is problem agnostic, meaning it can be applied to other end-to-end JSCC problems, such as remote classification, without modification.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation.

BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details.

Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels.

On the contrary, specific restoration aims to incorporate the identity features from the reference of the same identity, in which the requirement of proper reference severely limits the application scenarios. Generally, it is a challenging and intractable task to improve the photo-realistic performance of blind restoration and adaptively handle the generic and specific restoration scenarios with a single unified model. Instead of implicitly learning the mapping from a low-quality image to its high-quality counterpart, this paper suggests a DMDNet by explicitly memorizing the generic and specific features through dual dictionaries. First, the generic dictionary learns the general facial priors from high-quality images of any identity, while the specific dictionary stores the identity-belonging features for each person individually. Second, to handle the degraded input with or without specific reference, dictionary transform module is suggested to read the relevant details from the dual dictionaries which are subsequently fused into the input features.

Additionally, generating realistic details in restored images is a difficult task, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying image structure and content. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to capture the nuances of image degradations and may not be able to generate realistic details. Technical obstacles that need to be overcome include developing robust and efficient algorithms that can handle a wide range of degradation types and image types, as well as designing effective evaluation metrics that can accurately assess the quality of restored images.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research on image restoration has focused on specific types of degradations or image types, and has not addressed the problem of developing a unified framework for blind image restoration. Existing methods often rely on specific assumptions about the degradation process, which can limit their generalization ability and make them less effective in real-world scenarios. Additionally, previous methods may not have fully exploited the potential of deep learning techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, which have shown great promise in image restoration tasks. Our approach differs from prior work in that it aims to develop a unified framework that can handle a wide range of degradation types and image types, and that can generate realistic details in restored images. We propose to use a combination of deep learning techniques, including GANs and diffusion models, to develop a robust and efficient algorithm that can handle the complexities of blind image restoration.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components:\n\n* A deep learning-based framework that can handle a wide range of degradation types and image types\n* A combination of GANs and diffusion models to generate realistic details in restored images\n* A robust and efficient algorithm that can handle the complexities of blind image restoration\n* A comprehensive evaluation framework that includes metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and visual information fidelity (VIF)\n\nWe expect our approach to achieve state-of-the-art results in blind image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. We also expect our approach to be more robust and versatile than existing methods, and to be able to handle a wide range of degradation types and image types.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, 3], "token_usage": 90964, "agent_kpis": {"agent5": 5, "agent3": 1}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 3, "feasibility": 4}}

This, in turn, can have significant practical applications in areas such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban planning. Furthermore, a solution to this problem can also contribute to the broader field of multimodal learning, enabling the development of more effective and efficient models for a wide range of applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nSelecting high-quality, generalizable datasets for fine-tuning multimodal large language models is a challenging task due to the complexity and diversity of remote sensing data. Naive or straightforward approaches, such as random sampling or simple clustering, may fail to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Additionally, the high dimensionality and variability of remote sensing data can make it difficult to identify the most relevant and informative features. Furthermore, the lack of annotated data and the need for domain-specific expertise can also pose significant challenges.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing methods for selecting datasets for fine-tuning multimodal large language models, but these methods have limitations. For example, some methods rely on manual annotation or expert knowledge, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Others may use simple clustering or sampling techniques, which may not capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures.

This would have significant implications for various applications, such as image and video understanding, generation, and manipulation. Furthermore, it would provide insights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning, shedding light on how humans process and represent visual information.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThis problem is challenging because it requires developing a neural network that can learn to represent and generate complex scenes in a hierarchical and compositional manner, without relying on explicit linguistic or symbolic representations. Naive approaches may fail because they may not be able to capture the underlying structure and semantics of the scenes, or may not be able to generalize to new, unseen scenes. Additionally, the problem requires developing a network that can learn to represent and generate scenes in a probabilistic and compositional manner, which is a complex task.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing neural networks that can learn to represent and generate scenes in a flat and non-compositional manner, or have relied on explicit linguistic or symbolic representations. However, these approaches have limitations, such as not being able to capture the underlying structure and semantics of the scenes, or not being able to generalize to new, unseen scenes. Our approach differs from prior work by developing a neural network that can learn to represent and generate scenes in a hierarchical and compositional manner, without relying on explicit linguistic or symbolic representations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach, called Hierarchical Scene Representation and Generation (HSRG), consists of two key components: (1) a hierarchical scene representation module, which learns to represent scenes in a hierarchical and compositional manner, and (2) a probabilistic scene generation module, which learns to generate scenes in a probabilistic and compositional manner. We plan to use a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to develop the hierarchical scene representation module, and a variational autoencoder (VAE) to develop the probabilistic scene generation module. We will evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including the CLEVR and COCO datasets, and will use metrics such as scene reconstruction accuracy and scene generation quality to evaluate the performance of our approach.

We tackle this planning issue by extending the policy gradient theory to policy updates with respect to any state density. Under these generalized policy updates, we show convergence to optimality under a necessary and sufficient condition on the updates' state densities, and thereby solve the aforementioned planning issue. We also prove asymptotic convergence rates that significantly improve those in the policy gradient literature.   To implement the principles prescribed by our theory, we propose an agent, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde (JH), with a double personality: Dr Jekyll purely exploits while Mr Hyde purely explores. JH's independent policies allow to record two separate replay buffers: one on-policy (Dr Jekyll's) and one off-policy (Mr Hyde's), and therefore to update JH's models with a mixture of on-policy and off-policy updates. More than an algorithm, JH defines principles for actor-critic algorithms to satisfy the requirements we identify in our analysis.

In this work, we introduce an alternative approach for computing more expressive general policies which does not require sample plans or a QNP planner. The new formulation is very simple and can be cast in terms that are more standard in machine learning: a large but finite pool of features is defined from the predicates in the planning examples using a general grammar, and a small subset of features is sought for separating \\\"good\\\" from \\\"bad\\\" state transitions, and goals from non-goals. The problems of finding such a \\\"separating surface\\\" while labeling the transitions as \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\" are jointly addressed as a single combinatorial optimization problem expressed as a Weighted Max-SAT problem.

Optimization-based approaches, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), can provide such optimal policies, but their computational complexity is generally unacceptable for real-time implementation. To address this problem, we propose a fast integrated planning and control framework that combines learning- and optimization-based approaches in a two-layer hierarchical structure. The first layer, defined as the \\\"policy layer\\\", is established by a neural network which learns the long-term optimal driving policy generated by MPC. The second layer, called the \\\"execution layer\\\", is a short-term optimization-based controller that tracks the reference trajecotries given by the \\\"policy layer\\\" with guaranteed short-term safety and feasibility.

In particular, recent approaches for learning general policies use state features derived from description logics or learned via graph neural networks (GNNs) that are known to be limited by the expressive power of C_2, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In this work, we address the problem of detecting symmetries in planning and generalized planning and use the results to assess the expressive requirements for learning general policies over various planning domains. For this, we map planning states to plain graphs, run off-the-shelf algorithms to determine whether two states are isomorphic with respect to the goal, and run coloring algorithms to determine if C_2 features computed logically or via GNNs distinguish non-isomorphic states. Symmetry detection results in more effective learning, while the failure to detect non-symmetries prevents general policies from being learned at all in certain domains.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15892v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727168687, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"5bc931b8-4a64-43d1-bdb0-3ab2d26d573e\", \"authors\": [\"Pawel Gomoluch\", \"Dalal Alrajeh\", \"Alessandra Russo\"], \"title\": \"Learning Classical Planning Strategies with Policy Gradient\", \"abstract\": \"A common paradigm in classical planning is heuristic forward search.

Under these generalized policy updates, we show convergence to optimality under a necessary and sufficient condition on the updates' state densities, and thereby solve the aforementioned planning issue.

In this work, we introduce an alternative approach for computing more expressive general policies which does not require sample plans or a QNP planner. The new formulation is very simple and can be cast in terms that are more standard in machine learning: a large but finite pool of features is defined from the predicates in the planning examples using a general grammar, and a small subset of features is sought for separating \\\"good\\\" from \\\"bad\\\" state transitions, and goals from non-goals. The problems of finding such a \\\"separating surface\\\" while labeling the transitions as \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\" are jointly addressed as a single combinatorial optimization problem expressed as a Weighted Max-SAT problem.

This, in turn, could lead to significant advances in various applications, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and decision-making under uncertainty. Furthermore, a more expressive and efficient approach to learning general policies could also lead to new insights and understanding of the underlying planning problems, ultimately contributing to the development of more sophisticated and intelligent planning systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe problem is challenging because it requires developing a new approach that can overcome the limitations of current methods, which are restricted by the expressive power of C2 logic. This means that the new approach must be able to handle complex planning problems that involve multiple variables and relations, which is a difficult task. Additionally, the approach must be efficient and scalable, as planning problems can be computationally expensive to solve. Furthermore, the approach must also be able to learn general policies that can be applied to a wide range of planning problems, which requires developing a deep understanding of the underlying planning problems and the relationships between them.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing methods that are restricted by the expressive power of C2 logic, which has limited their ability to handle complex planning problems. Additionally, many existing approaches rely on hand-crafted features or domain-specific knowledge, which can be difficult to obtain and may not generalize well to new planning problems. Furthermore, many existing approaches are not designed to learn general policies that can be applied to a wide range of planning problems, but rather focus on solving specific planning problems.

Taken together, developers' acceptable use policies include 127 distinct use restrictions; the wide variety in the number and type of use restrictions may create fragmentation across the AI supply chain.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal.

A sequence profile is usually represented as a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and accordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This paper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three key components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein family; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an efficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning two MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, encode information for the global 3D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much more sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that MRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods in terms of both alignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works particularly well for mainly beta proteins. For example, tested on the benchmark SCOP40 (8353 proteins) for homology detection, PSSM-PSSM and HMM-HMM succeed on 48% and 52% of proteins, respectively, at superfamily level, and on 15% and 27% of proteins, respectively, at fold level. In contrast, MRFalign succeeds on 57.3% and 42.5% of proteins at superfamily and fold level, respectively. This study implies that long-range residue interaction patterns are very helpful for sequence-based homology detection.

By developing a method to effectively merge multiple fine-tuned models, we can create more efficient and cost-effective models that can perform well across multiple tasks. This can lead to significant improvements in natural language processing, computer vision, and other areas where large language models are applied. Furthermore, this research can enable the development of more generalizable and adaptable models that can learn from multiple tasks and domains, leading to breakthroughs in areas like transfer learning and few-shot learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nMerging multiple fine-tuned models is a challenging problem due to the complexity of model interactions and the potential for interference among model parameters. Naive approaches, such as simply averaging model weights, may not work well due to the differences in model architectures and training objectives. Moreover, the merged model must balance the trade-off between leveraging knowledge across tasks and minimizing interference, which requires careful consideration of model design and training strategies. Additionally, the merged model must be able to generalize well to new, unseen tasks and domains, which adds to the complexity of the problem.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing methods for fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific tasks, but the problem of merging multiple fine-tuned models has received relatively little attention. Existing methods for model merging, such as model averaging and ensemble methods, have limitations and may not work well in all cases. Moreover, the complexity of model interactions and the potential for interference among model parameters have made it difficult to develop a generalizable and effective method for merging multiple fine-tuned models. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel method for merging models that takes into account the specific challenges of model interactions and interference.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur approach, called DELLA (Drop and rEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude), consists of three steps: (1) delta parameter drops to reduce interference among model parameters, (2) sign-based delta parameter selection to further reduce interference, and (3) fusion of the selected delta parameters. We propose a novel pruning method, MAG-PRUNE, that samples delta parameters based on their magnitudes. We evaluate our approach on three different homologous models (LM, Math, Code) and their corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaEval, GSM8K, MBPP). Our results show that DELLA outperforms baseline experiments and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets. We also conduct a pruning rate hyperparameter search to determine the optimal drop rate for each merging combination. Our expected outcomes include the development of a more efficient and cost-effective method for merging multiple fine-tuned models, which can lead to significant improvements in natural language processing and other areas where large language models are applied.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 124152, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 5, "agent3": 5, "agent4": 5}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47].

We validate our generative model on the molecular benchmark datasets, on which it demonstrates competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16883v4\", \"timestamp\": 1711382012, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"03e570f8-f40f-49cc-b0d7-de1ff0fb94ab\", \"authors\": [\"Ali Lotfi Rezaabad\", \"Rahi Kalantari\", \"Sriram Vishwanath\", \"Mingyuan Zhou\", \"Jonathan Tamir\"], \"title\": \"Hyperbolic Graph Embedding with Enhanced Semi-Implicit Variational Inference\", \"abstract\": \"Efficient modeling of relational data arising in physical, social, and information sciences is challenging due to complicated dependencies within the data. In this work, we build off of semi-implicit graph variational auto-encoders to capture higher-order statistics in a low-dimensional graph latent representation. We incorporate hyperbolic geometry in the latent space through a Poincare embedding to efficiently represent graphs exhibiting hierarchical structure. To address the naive posterior latent distribution assumptions in classical variational inference, we use semi-implicit hierarchical variational Bayes to implicitly capture posteriors of given graph data, which may exhibit heavy tails, multiple modes, skewness, and highly correlated latent structures. We show that the existing semi-implicit variational inference objective provably reduces information in the observed graph. Based on this observation, we estimate and add an additional mutual information term to the semi-implicit variational inference learning objective to capture rich correlations arising between the input and latent spaces. We show that the inclusion of this regularization term in conjunction with the Poincare embedding boosts the quality of learned high-level representations and enables more flexible and faithful graphical modeling. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing graph variational auto-encoders both in Euclidean and in hyperbolic spaces for edge link prediction and node classification.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00194v2\", \"timestamp\": 1604123314, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we develop a more effective and efficient latent graph inference method that can learn the underlying graph structure and node representations from node features, without relying on a prior graph or explicit graph structure?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is interesting and important because it has the potential to advance the field of graph neural networks and latent graph inference. By developing a more effective and efficient method, we can improve the performance of graph neural networks on various tasks, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. This can lead to practical applications in areas such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and molecular biology. Furthermore, a more effective latent graph inference method can also enable the analysis of complex systems and networks that are difficult to model using traditional graph-based methods.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThis problem is challenging because it requires developing a method that can learn the underlying graph structure and node representations from node features, without relying on a prior graph or explicit graph structure. This is a difficult task because the graph structure is not explicitly given, and the method must be able to infer the graph structure from the node features. Additionally, the method must be able to handle noisy or incomplete data, and it must be scalable to large graphs. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they may not be able to capture the complex relationships between nodes, or they may not be able to handle the noise or incompleteness of the data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research on latent graph inference has focused on developing methods that rely on a prior graph or explicit graph structure. These methods may not be effective when the graph structure is not explicitly given, or when the data is noisy or incomplete. Additionally, previous methods may not be scalable to large graphs, or they may not be able to capture the complex relationships between nodes. Our approach differs from prior work by developing a method that can learn the underlying graph structure and node representations from node features, without relying on a prior graph or explicit graph structure. We also propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of different latent graph inference methods, and we evaluate our method on a range of benchmark datasets.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur approach consists of the following key components:\n\n* A novel latent graph inference method that combines the strengths of different latent graph inference methods\n* A method for learning the underlying graph structure and node representations from node features, without relying on a prior graph or explicit graph structure\n* A scalable and efficient algorithm for large graphs\n* A evaluation on a range of benchmark datasets, including social networks, molecular biology, and recommendation systems\n\nOur expected outcomes include:\n\n* Improved performance on various graph-based tasks, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction\n* A more effective and efficient latent graph inference method that can handle noisy or incomplete data\n* A scalable and efficient algorithm for large graphs\n* A better understanding of the strengths and limitations of different latent graph inference methods, and how they can be combined to achieve better performance.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 59653, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 3, "agent3": 3}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user \u2014 more specifically, her one-hop neighbors \u2014 to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al.

This habilitation elaborates on aspects related to these three notions in the light of recommender systems, namely: (i) transparency and cognitive models, (ii) privacy and limited preference information, and (iii) fairness and popularity bias in recommender systems. Specifically, with respect to aspect (i), we highlight the usefulness of incorporating psychological theories for a transparent design process of recommender systems. We term this type of systems psychology-informed recommender systems. In aspect (ii), we study and address the trade-off between accuracy and privacy in differentially-private recommendations. We design a novel recommendation approach for collaborative filtering based on an efficient neighborhood reuse concept, which reduces the number of users that need to be protected with differential privacy. Furthermore, we address the related issue of limited availability of user preference information, e.g., click data, in the settings of session-based and cold-start recommendations. With respect to aspect (iii), we analyze popularity bias in recommender systems. We find that the recommendation frequency of an item is positively correlated with this item's popularity.

However, as we document in a large-scale online survey, users do choose content strategically to influence the types of content they get recommended in the future.   We model this user behavior as a two-stage noisy signalling game between the recommendation system and users: the recommendation system initially commits to a recommendation policy, presents content to the users during a cold start phase which the users choose to strategically consume in order to affect the types of content they will be recommended in a recommendation phase. We show that in equilibrium, users engage in behaviors that accentuate their differences to users of different preference profiles. In addition, (statistical) minorities out of fear of losing their minority content exposition may not consume content that is liked by mainstream users. We next propose three interventions that may improve recommendation quality (both on average and for minorities) when taking into account strategic consumption: (1) Adopting a recommendation system policy that uses preferences from a prior, (2) Communicating to users that universally liked (\\\"mainstream\\\") content will not be used as basis of recommendation, and (3) Serving content that is personalized-enough yet expected to be liked in the beginning.

Additionally, there is a lack of clear metrics and evaluation frameworks for assessing the cultural citizenship of recommender systems, making it difficult to measure progress and compare different approaches.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on optimizing recommender systems for personalization, with limited attention paid to cultural citizenship. Existing approaches often rely on simplistic metrics, such as diversity and novelty, which do not fully capture the complexities of cultural citizenship. Furthermore, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research that combines insights from computer science, social sciences, and humanities to develop a comprehensive understanding of cultural citizenship in recommender systems. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that integrates cultural citizenship into the design and evaluation of recommender systems.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components:\n\n1. **Data collection**: We will collect a large-scale dataset of user interactions with cultural content, including ratings, reviews, and demographic information.\n2. **Cultural citizenship metrics**: We will develop a set of metrics that capture the cultural citizenship of recommender systems, including commonality, diversity, and inclusivity.\n3. **Recommender system design**: We will design a recommender system that incorporates cultural citizenship metrics into the recommendation algorithm, using techniques such as multi-objective optimization and fairness-aware ranking.\n4. **Evaluation framework**: We will develop an evaluation framework that assesses the cultural citizenship of recommender systems, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.\n\nExpected outcomes include:\n\n1. **Improved cultural citizenship**: Our recommender system will promote a more diverse and inclusive cultural experience for users.\n2. **Increased user engagement**: By balancing personalization and cultural citizenship, our system will increase user engagement and satisfaction.\n3. **New insights into cultural citizenship**: Our research will provide new insights into the complexities of cultural citizenship in recommender systems, informing the development of future systems.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 57199, "agent_kpis": {"agent4": 3}, "total_milestones": 3, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2. Related Work\n\n\n2.1. Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels.

To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization.

We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2.

Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer.

In this work, we propose a stylization framework for NeRF based on local style transfer. In particular, we use a hash-grid encoding to learn the embedding of the appearance and geometry components, and show that the mapping defined by the hash table allows us to control the stylization to a certain extent. Stylization is then achieved by optimizing the appearance branch while keeping the geometry branch fixed. To support local style transfer, we propose a new loss function that utilizes a segmentation network and bipartite matching to establish region correspondences between the style image and the content images obtained from volume rendering.

Specifically, we adopt the emerging neural radiance fields (NeRF) as our choice of 3D scene representation for their capability to render high-quality novel views for a variety of scenes. However, as rendering a novel view from a NeRF requires a large number of samples, training a stylized NeRF requires a large amount of GPU memory that goes beyond an off-the-shelf GPU capacity.

We address this challenge by formulating, to the best of our knowledge, the first differentiable end-to-end LiDAR rendering framework, LiDAR-NeRF, leveraging a neural radiance field (NeRF) to facilitate the joint learning of geometry and the attributes of 3D points. However, simply employing NeRF cannot achieve satisfactory results, as it only focuses on learning individual pixels while ignoring local information, especially at low texture areas, resulting in poor geometry. To this end, we have taken steps to address this issue by introducing a structural regularization method to preserve local structural details. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we establish an object-centric multi-view LiDAR dataset, dubbed NeRF-MVL.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3.

Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners.

While traditional methods like Structure from Motion are commonly used for camera pose calculation in pre-processing for NeRFs, the HoloLens offers an interesting interface for extracting the required input data directly. We present a workflow for high-resolution 3D reconstructions almost directly from HoloLens data using NeRFs. Thereby, different investigations are considered: Internal camera poses from the HoloLens trajectory via a server application, and external camera poses from Structure from Motion, both with an enhanced variant applied through pose refinement. Results show that the internal camera poses lead to NeRF convergence with a PSNR of 25\\\\,dB with a simple rotation around the x-axis and enable a 3D reconstruction. Pose refinement enables comparable quality compared to external camera poses, resulting in improved training process with a PSNR of 27\\\\,dB and a better 3D reconstruction.

Given an arbitrary view and two sets of scene images captured at different timestamps, we can predict the scene changes in that view, which has significant potential applications in scene monitoring and measuring. We conducted preliminary studies and found that such an exciting task cannot be easily achieved by utilizing existing NeRFs and 2D change detection methods with many false or missing detections. The main reason is that the 2D change detection is based on the pixel appearance difference between spatial-aligned image pairs and neglects the stereo information in the NeRF. To address the limitations, we propose the C-NERF to represent scene changes as directional consistency difference-based NeRF, which mainly contains three modules. We first perform the spatial alignment of two NeRFs captured before and after changes. Then, we identify the change points based on the direction-consistent constraint; that is, real change points have similar change representations across view directions, but fake change points do not. Finally, we design the change map rendering process based on the built NeRFs and can generate the change map of an arbitrarily specified view direction. To validate the effectiveness, we build a new dataset containing ten scenes covering diverse scenarios with different changing objects.

In analogy to the extensive usage of image super-resolution, NeRF super-resolution is an effective way to generate the high-resolution implicit representation of 3D scenes and holds great potential applications. Up to now, such an important topic is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a NeRF super-resolution method, named Super-NeRF, to generate high-resolution NeRF from only low-resolution inputs. Given multi-view low-resolution images, Super-NeRF constructs a consistency-controlling super-resolution module to generate view-consistent high-resolution details for NeRF. Specifically, an optimizable latent code is introduced for each low-resolution input image to control the 2D super-resolution images to converge to the view-consistent output. The latent codes of each low-resolution image are optimized synergistically with the target Super-NeRF representation to fully utilize the view consistency constraint inherent in NeRF construction.

It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose.

Firstly, NeRFs are complex models that require large amounts of data and computational resources to train. Secondly, stylization with texture details and multimodal guidance requires a deep understanding of the underlying geometry and appearance of the 3D scene, which can be difficult to capture using traditional methods.

Existing methods also often rely on traditional optimization techniques, which can be computationally expensive and may not always converge to the optimal solution.

It has imposed significant and unprecedented  sufferings and threats for \npremature death  [2]. Unequivocally , it is now regarded as  the most deadly and dangerous disease that ma kes \nsevere panic to the crowd [3].  The well-known reason for death  of this pandemic  is obstacles in oxygen intake \ndue to inflammation lung, filled air sacs with discharge and fluid  [3]. Early  identification of the  COVID can  not \nonly reduce  death  rate sharply, but also most prone  to faster recovery  phase  [1]. \nFor the first time in the December of 2019, the sick persons  infected with COVID -19 were identified in Wuhan, \nChina  [4]. Often, the patients develop a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, weariness , sore throat, pains, runny \nnose, body aches, and diarrhoea symptoms.  High fever and dry cough are its core symptoms  [3]. Its symptoms \nare similar to pneumonia and influenza- A that affect the human respiratory tract and lungs  [1, 5] . Since the \nseparation of infection between COVID -19 and bacterial pneumonia is not an easy task, the automatic feature \nextraction from images can help to diagnose the disease [6]. The di fference is that lung lesions in COVID -19 \npatients are higher than pneumonia and influenza diseases [7]. In fact, COVID- 19 damages the lungs intensely.  \nThe virus causes the demise of most persons  who have chronic diseases  (for instance, diabetes) [8].   \nThe viability of this virus in the air is  expected to be for almost three hours  [3]. It can travel through the \npatient's cough or sneeze droplets fro m person to person in close contact. It can even contaminate humans with \neating food in infected copper, plastic, and stainless steel dishes . It should be mentioned out  the COVID\u2010 19 can \nbe live in aforementioned utensils  for several hours  [3]. \nSeveral diagnostic tasks  such as  viral throat swab testing , blood, and serologic tests are conducted for this \ndisease . Also, Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR) is a yardstick from Nasopharyngeal \nSwabs (NS) and Or -pharyngeal Swabs (OS) samples. Nevertheless, these recognition measures do  not only require \nmanual intervention but also are time -consuming process es [2, 9] . Therefore, using  the X-ray or Computed \nTomography (CT) data  is more preferable [10, 11] . These scanning images conspicuously indicate COVID -19 \nviral infections  with higher confidence . Although, t hese medical  imaging modalities are available and \n                                                    \n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

This can help reduce the mortality rate and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, this research can contribute to the advancement of medical imaging analysis and machine learning applications in healthcare.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping an accurate machine learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis from X-ray or CT images is challenging due to the complexity of the images, the variability in image quality, and the need for large datasets. Naive approaches may fail due to the lack of robust feature extraction and the presence of noise in the images. Technical obstacles include the need for high-performance computing resources, the requirement for large annotated datasets, and the challenge of handling class imbalance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing machine learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis from X-ray or CT images, but these models have limitations, such as requiring manual feature extraction, being computationally expensive, or having limited generalizability. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a deep learning-based approach that can automatically extract features from images and handle large datasets.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following steps:\n\n1. Data collection: We will collect a large dataset of X-ray or CT images from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals.\n2. Data preprocessing: We will preprocess the images to enhance quality and remove noise.\n3. Feature extraction: We will use a deep learning-based approach, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically extract features from the images.\n4. Model training: We will train a machine learning model using the extracted features to diagnose COVID-19.\n5. Model evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nExpected outcomes include the development of an accurate and efficient machine learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis from X-ray or CT images, which can be used in clinical settings to improve patient outcomes.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [3, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 23839, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 1}, "total_milestones": 1, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 3, "feasibility": 4}}

Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning.

This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample, recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1). Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n\u00a9 S. Hanneke, S. Moran & T.

Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1.

Our primary goal is to determine whether classical principles in the PAC setting retain their applicability in the domain of list PAC learning. We focus on uniform convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam's Razor). In classical PAC learning, both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of `completeness': whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres to these principles. We ask whether the same completeness holds true in the list learning setting.   We show that uniform convergence remains equivalent to learnability in the list PAC learning setting. In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\\\\{0,1,2\\\\}$, then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986). We prove an even stronger impossibility result, showing that there are $2$-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed even when the reconstructed function can work with lists of arbitrarily large size.

List PAC learning has numerous applications in real-world problems, such as recommendation systems, image recognition, and healthcare. By understanding the fundamental principles of list PAC learning, researchers can develop more efficient and effective algorithms that can tackle complex problems. This, in turn, can lead to significant advances in various fields, including computer science, engineering, and healthcare.\n\nMoreover, this research can also shed light on the limitations and challenges of list PAC learning, which can inform the development of new algorithms and techniques. By addressing this question, researchers can contribute to the development of more robust and reliable machine learning models that can handle complex and uncertain data.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nSolving this problem is challenging because list PAC learning is a complex and nuanced field that involves multiple variables and uncertainties. One of the main challenges is that list PAC learning requires the learner to output multiple plausible labels for each instance, rather than just one. This makes it difficult to define and measure the accuracy of the learner, as well as to develop algorithms that can efficiently search for the optimal solution.\n\nAnother challenge is that list PAC learning involves a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. As the learner outputs more labels, the accuracy of the learner may increase, but the complexity of the learner also increases, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization.\n\nFurthermore, list PAC learning is a relatively new field, and there is a lack of established theories and frameworks that can guide the development of algorithms and techniques. This makes it difficult for researchers to develop a deep understanding of the underlying principles of list PAC learning.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nDespite the importance of list PAC learning, it remains a relatively understudied field. One of the main reasons is that list PAC learning is a complex and challenging problem that requires a deep understanding of multiple disciplines, including machine learning, statistics, and computer science.\n\nAnother reason is that list PAC learning is a relatively new field, and there is a lack of established theories and frameworks that can guide the development of algorithms and techniques. This makes it difficult for researchers to develop a deep understanding of the underlying principles of list PAC learning.\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing algorithms and techniques for specific applications of list PAC learning, such as recommendation systems and image recognition. However, these approaches are often ad-hoc and do not provide a deep understanding of the underlying principles of list PAC learning.\n\nOur approach differs from previous work in that we aim to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental principles of list PAC learning. We will use a combination of theoretical and empirical methods to develop a deep understanding of the underlying principles of list PAC learning, and to develop algorithms and techniques that can efficiently and effectively solve list PAC learning problems.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur approach will involve a combination of theoretical and empirical methods. We will start by developing a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental principles of list PAC learning. This will involve a review of existing literature and the development of new theories and frameworks that can guide the development of algorithms and techniques.\n\nWe will then use this framework to develop algorithms and techniques for solving list PAC learning problems. We will use a combination of machine learning and statistical techniques, such as decision trees, neural networks, and Bayesian methods, to develop algorithms that can efficiently and effectively solve list PAC learning problems.\n\nWe will evaluate the performance of our algorithms using a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets. We will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of our algorithms, and we will compare our results to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\nWe expect our approach to result in a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental principles of list PAC learning, as well as algorithms and techniques that can efficiently and effectively solve list PAC learning problems.

With few exceptions (that will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\nspecifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\non the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to produce the provided graphs and features.

But here feature\nengineering and table flattening are typically prioritized over ex-\nploiting rich network effects as with GNNs [ 9,14,47,48]. Critically\nthough, currently-available head-to-head comparisons involving\ndiverse candidate approaches representative of both branches on\nun-filtered RDB/multi-table data are insufficient for drawing clear-\ncut conclusions regarding which might be preferable and under\nwhat particular circumstances.\nTo address the aforementioned limitations and help advance\npredictive modeling over RDB data, in Section 2 we first introduce\na generic supervised learning formulation across both inductive\nand transductive settings covering dynamic RDBs as commonly-\nencountered in practice.

Low-dimensional embeddings aim to encapsulate a concise vector representation for an underlying dataset with minimum loss of information. Embeddings across entities in a relational database have been less explored due to the intricate data relations and representation complexity involved. Relational databases are an inter-weaved collection of relations that not only model relationships between entities but also record complex domain-specific quantitative and temporal attributes of data defining complex relationships among entities. Recent methods for learning an embedding constitute of a naive approach to consider complete denormalization of the database by materializing the full join of all tables and representing as a knowledge graph. This popular approach has certain limitations as it fails to capture the inter-row relationships and additional semantics encoded in the relational databases. In this paper we demonstrate; a better methodology for learning representations by exploiting the underlying semantics of columns in a table while using the relation joins and the latent inter-row relationships.

The input to learning classification and regression models is a training dataset defined by feature extraction queries over relational databases. The mainstream approach to learning over relational data is to materialize the training dataset, export it out of the database, and then learn over it using a statistical package. This approach can be expensive as it requires the materialization of the training dataset. An alternative approach is to cast the machine learning problem as a database problem by transforming the data-intensive component of the learning task into a batch of aggregates over the feature extraction query and by computing this batch directly over the input database.   The tutorial highlights a variety of techniques developed by the database theory and systems communities to improve the performance of the learning task. They rely on structural properties of the relational data and of the feature extraction query, including algebraic (semi-ring), combinatorial (hypertree width), statistical (sampling), or geometric (distance) structure. They also rely on factorized computation, code specialization, query compilation, and parallelization.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06577v1\", \"timestamp\": 1573818600, \"domain\": \"cs.DB\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"940adf47-add6-4503-84ff-b7d9dc52af83\", \"authors\": [\"Han Zhang\", \"Quan Gan\", \"David Wipf\", \"Weinan Zhang\"], \"title\": \"GFS: Graph-based Feature Synthesis for Prediction over Relational Databases\", \"abstract\": \"Relational databases are extensively utilized in a variety of modern information system applications, and they always carry valuable data patterns. There are a huge number of data mining or machine learning tasks conducted on relational databases. However, it is worth noting that there are limited machine learning models specifically designed for relational databases, as most models are primarily tailored for single table settings. Consequently, the prevalent approach for training machine learning models on data stored in relational databases involves performing feature engineering to merge the data from multiple tables into a single table and subsequently applying single table models. This approach not only requires significant effort in feature engineering but also destroys the inherent relational structure present in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Graph-based Feature Synthesis (GFS). GFS formulates the relational database as a heterogeneous graph, thereby preserving the relational structure within the data. By leveraging the inductive bias from single table models, GFS effectively captures the intricate relationships inherent in each table. Additionally, the whole framework eliminates the need for manual feature engineering. In the extensive experiment over four real-world multi-table relational databases, GFS outperforms previous methods designed for relational databases, demonstrating its superior performance.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02037v1\", \"timestamp\": 1701708880, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2fb0b272-c090-4c69-bea0-48cb9114487f\", \"authors\": [\"Siddhant Arora\", \"Vinayak Gupta\", \"Garima Gaur\", \"Srikanta Bedathur\"], \"title\": \"BERT Meets Relational DB: Contextual Representations of Relational Databases\", \"abstract\": \"In this paper, we address the problem of learning low dimension representation of entities on relational databases consisting of multiple tables.

Current work is restricted to working with just single table, or using pretrained embeddings over an external corpus making them unsuitable for use in real-world databases. In this work, we look into ways of using these attention-based model to learn embeddings for entities in the relational database.

Additionally, the lack of established benchmarks and evaluation metrics for RDBs makes it difficult to compare and evaluate different approaches.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on either graph learning or tabular modeling, but these approaches have limitations when applied to RDBs. Graph learning approaches may not effectively capture the complex relationships between tables, while tabular modeling approaches may require significant feature engineering and data transformation, which can be time-consuming and may not preserve the inherent structure of the data. Moreover, the lack of established benchmarks and evaluation metrics for RDBs has hindered the development of effective solutions. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that combines the strengths of graph learning and tabular modeling, while also addressing the limitations of existing approaches.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach, called Relational Database Learning (RDL), combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and tabular modeling to effectively learn predictive models over RDBs. The key components of our approach include:\n\n* A novel graph-based feature synthesis method that preserves the relational structure of the data\n* A GNN-based architecture that captures the complex relationships between tables\n* A tabular modeling component that leverages the strengths of traditional machine learning models\n* A set of evaluation metrics and benchmarks specifically designed for RDBs\n\nWe plan to evaluate our approach using a variety of real-world RDBs and compare its performance to existing approaches. We expect our approach to outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, and to provide a more effective solution for learning predictive models over RDBs.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 75641, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 6}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information. The proposed approach\nachieves not only enhanced accuracy in identifying malicious\npayloads, but also pushes the boundaries of current methodolo-\ngies that help distinguish malicious payload types by employing\ntwo different classification heads.\nII. D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata. Similarly, we randomly select an equal number of benign\npayload entries as malicious entries to balance the final dataset.\nThe benign entries are labeled as 0. It is important to randomly\nselect an equal amount\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

However, their sensitivity to adversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given rise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware example Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware variants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box methods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most malware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating non-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice due to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal language model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to malware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte sequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT).
