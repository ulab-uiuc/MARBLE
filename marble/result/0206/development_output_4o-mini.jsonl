Users should be able to invite others to join a budget and assign different levels of access (e.g., view-only, edit).\n   - The application should include adaptive features that adjust based on user feedback and financial data. For example, it should automatically suggest budget adjustments when spending exceeds a certain threshold or when income changes significantly.\n   - BudgetSync should provide visual representations of budget breakdowns, such as pie charts and bar graphs, to help users understand their financial patterns. Users should be able to customize these visualizations based on their preferences.\n   - The application must include a notification system that alerts users to important budget updates, such as when a budget goal is reached, when a spending limit is exceeded, or when a new user is added to a shared budget.\n   - BudgetSync should offer a feedback mechanism where users can provide input on the application's performance and suggest improvements. The system should adapt to this feedback by implementing changes or offering new features in subsequent updates.\n\n\n2. Project structure:\n   - solution.py (main implementation)\n\n3.

Implementation requirements:\n   - The system should allow multiple users to create an account and log in securely.\n   - Users should be able to create and join groups, where they can collaboratively set financial goals with specific deadlines and milestones.\n   - The system should provide a dashboard for each user to view the progress of their shared financial goals, including the total amount saved, the amount each user has contributed, and the remaining amount needed to reach the goal.\n   - Users should receive notifications and reminders about upcoming deadlines and milestones, as well as alerts when the group deviates from the budget.\n   - The system should include a chat feature to facilitate communication among group members.\n   - Comprehensive test cases should be provided to validate the functionality of user authentication, group creation, goal setting, contribution tracking, and notification systems. Test cases should include both typical use scenarios and edge cases, such as handling duplicate user accounts, invalid input, and network failures.\n\n\n2.

Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Implement a user registration and authentication system to allow multiple designers to create accounts and log into the application. This must be completed before any collaborative features can be used.\n   - 2. **Real-Time Collaboration Canvas**: Develop a shared digital canvas where multiple designers can simultaneously draw, edit, and manipulate design elements. The canvas should support real-time updates, ensuring that all changes are visible to all participants. This feature depends on the completion of the user registration and authentication system.\n   - 3. **Shape and Texture Tools**: Integrate a set of tools for creating and editing geometric shapes and applying custom textures. These tools should be accessible within the collaboration canvas and must be functional before users can start designing.\n   - 4. **Element Management and Organization**: Implement features for aligning, grouping, and arranging design elements within the canvas.

ImageCanvasComposer is a graphics application that enables users to work with multiple image layers, apply filters, and blend them into a single, high-quality composite image, with features for layer management, effect application, and export options.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. Layer Management: Implement a system for creating, loading, and managing multiple image layers. Users should be able to add new layers, delete existing ones, and reorder layers within the canvas. This functionality must be completed before proceeding to the next step.\n   - 2. Graphical Effects and Filters: Develop a suite of graphical effects and filters that can be applied to individual layers or the entire canvas. Effects include but are not limited to brightness/contrast adjustments, color correction, blurring, and sharpening. This feature depends on the completion of the Layer Management system.\n   - 3. Blending and Composition: Introduce blending modes and composition tools that allow users to seamlessly combine layers. Users should be able to adjust the transparency, position, and size of each layer, as well as use alignment tools to ensure smooth transitions. This feature depends on the completion of both Layer Management and Graphical Effects and Filters.\n   - 4. Export and Save: Implement export and save functionalities that allow users to export the final composite image in various formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PSD).

{"task": "Software Development Task:\n\nPlease write a management game application called ProjectSynergy. ProjectSynergy is a management game that simulates a software development project where players must collaborate to complete tasks, manage resources, and deliver a successful project. The game involves setting up a project plan, assigning tasks to team members, managing dependencies, and resolving issues that arise during the project lifecycle. The goal is to deliver the project on time and within budget while maintaining high-quality standards.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. **Project Setup**: Players must first set up the project by defining the scope, budget, and timeline. They need to create a project plan that includes a list of tasks, estimated durations, and dependencies between tasks. This step must be completed before any other tasks can begin.\n   - 2. **Team Management**: Players must assign tasks to team members based on their skills and availability. Each team member must be assigned specific tasks, and players need to ensure that dependencies are managed correctly. This step can only begin after the project setup is complete.\n   - 3. **Task Execution**: Players must monitor the progress of each task and ensure that team members are completing their work on time. If a task is delayed, players must reassign or adjust the project plan to keep the project on track. This step is dependent on the completion of the team management phase.\n   - 4. **Issue Resolution**: Players must identify and resolve issues that arise during the project. This could include technical problems, resource constraints, or team conflicts. Players need to prioritize issues and allocate resources to resolve them efficiently.

Implementation requirements:\n   - Frontend: Develop a responsive user interface using React or Vue.js that allows users to upload photos, select tools, and apply filters. The interface should support real-time collaboration, displaying changes made by all users simultaneously.\n   - Backend: Implement a Node.js server using Express to handle real-time communication between users. Use WebSockets (via Socket.io) to enable instant updates and synchronize editing actions across multiple clients.\n   - Database: Design a MongoDB database to store user sessions, photo metadata, and editing actions. Ensure that the database can handle concurrent writes and reads efficiently to support real-time collaboration.\n   - Collaboration Features: Implement features for user authentication and session management. Allow users to create and join editing sessions, where they can see who is currently working on the photo and chat with other participants.\n   - Editing Tools: Provide a comprehensive set of tools for photo editing, including filters, color adjustments, and background removal.

MASF is a comprehensive system that enables multiple AI agents to work together in developing and enhancing a shooter game, focusing on both the frontend and backend aspects of the game. The system facilitates the creation of a dynamic and interactive game environment where agents can contribute to game mechanics, user interface design, and backend logic, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for players.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - The frontend domain should be responsible for designing and implementing the user interface, including the game screen, scoreboards, and menus. The frontend should be developed using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and should be responsive to various screen sizes.\n   - The backend domain should handle game logic, player management, and data storage. It should be built using a robust server-side framework like Node.js or Django, and should include a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store player data, game states, and leaderboard information.\n   - The system should support real-time communication between the frontend and backend using WebSockets to ensure that game events and updates are synchronized across all connected clients. Additionally, the backend should provide APIs for the frontend to interact with, such as fetching player data, submitting scores, and updating game states.\n   - The Multi-Agent Shooter Framework should include a collaboration layer that allows multiple AI agents to contribute to the game's development. Each agent should be able to specialize in a specific domain (e.g., one agent for frontend design, another for backend logic) and collaborate through a shared development environment. The framework should provide tools and APIs for agents to communicate, share code, and integrate their contributions seamlessly.\n   - The game should feature a variety of shooting challenges, including target practice, enemy waves, and timed missions. Each challenge should have adjustable difficulty levels and provide players with feedback on their performance, such as accuracy and reaction time.\n   - The system should include a robust testing and debugging environment to ensure that the game functions correctly and that the contributions from multiple agents are integrated without conflicts. The testing environment should support automated and manual testing, and should provide detailed logs and reports for troubleshooting.\n\n\n2.
