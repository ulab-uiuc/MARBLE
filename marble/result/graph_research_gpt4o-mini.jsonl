This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

Two major approaches for instruction tuning characterize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which are currently applied to produce the best commercial LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT). To improve the accessibility of LLMs for research and development efforts, various instruction-tuned open-source LLMs have also been introduced recently, e.g., Alpaca, Vicuna, to name a few. However, existing open-source LLMs have only been instruction-tuned for English and a few popular languages, thus hindering their impacts and accessibility to many other languages in the world. Among a few very recent work to explore instruction tuning for LLMs in multiple languages, SFT has been used as the only approach to instruction-tune LLMs for multiple languages. This has left a significant gap for fine-tuned LLMs based on RLHF in diverse languages and raised important questions on how RLHF can boost the performance of multilingual instruction tuning. To overcome this issue, we present Okapi, the first system with instruction-tuned LLMs based on RLHF for multiple languages. Okapi introduces instruction and response-ranked data in 26 diverse languages to facilitate the experiments and development of future multilingual LLM research.

Our approach aims to fill these gaps by proposing a dynamic growth paradigm that utilizes existing annotated datasets to generate high-quality instruction data automatically.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a dynamic data curation system that uses large language models to identify relevant data fields and generate appropriate instructions based on existing datasets. We will evaluate our approach using metrics such as instruction-following accuracy and model performance on various tasks. The expected outcomes include a more efficient and effective instruction-tuning process that enhances LLM capabilities, leading to improved performance across a range of applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 63127, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 3}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

The proposed graph unrolling networks expand algorithm unrolling to the graph domain and provide an interpretation of the architecture design from a signal processing perspective. We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two special cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC) and graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional denoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

By providing interpretable models, researchers and practitioners can better understand the decision-making processes of GNNs, leading to improved model design and deployment. This research could pave the way for future advancements in explainable AI, enabling more robust applications in critical areas such as healthcare and finance where understanding model predictions is essential.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of graph structures and the interdependencies between nodes and edges make it challenging to derive meaningful explanations from GNNs. Naive approaches may fail because they often overlook the relational nature of graph data, leading to explanations that are either too general or not applicable to specific instances. Additionally, existing explanation methods may not ensure that the explanations are valid, sparse, or robust against perturbations, which complicates the development of reliable interpretability techniques.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on post-hoc explanation methods that do not integrate interpretability into the model design itself. Many existing approaches lack the rigor needed to ensure that explanations are both meaningful and applicable across different contexts.

To tackle this issue, meta-learning has been proposed to transfer structural knowledge from base classes with abundant labels to target novel classes. However, existing solutions become ineffective or inapplicable when base classes have no or limited labeled nodes. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method dubbed Virtual Node Tuning (VNT). Our approach utilizes a pretrained graph transformer as the encoder and injects virtual nodes as soft prompts in the embedding space, which can be optimized with few-shot labels in novel classes to modulate node embeddings for each specific FSNC task. A unique feature of VNT is that, by incorporating a Graph-based Pseudo Prompt Evolution (GPPE) module, VNT-GPPE can handle scenarios with sparse labels in base classes. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in addressing FSNC with unlabeled or sparsely labeled base classes, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and even fully supervised baselines.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06063v1\", \"timestamp\": 1686332302, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a3511787-e428-4d26-96f8-8ac03e71bba1\", \"authors\": [\"Le Yu\", \"Leilei Sun\", \"Bowen Du\", \"Tongyu Zhu\", \"Weifeng Lv\"], \"title\": \"Label-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for Semi-supervised Node Classification\", \"abstract\": \"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the semi-supervised node classification task, where a key point lies in how to sufficiently leverage the limited but valuable label information. Most of the classical GNNs solely use the known labels for computing the classification loss at the output. In recent years, several methods have been designed to additionally utilize the labels at the input. One part of the methods augment the node features via concatenating or adding them with the one-hot encodings of labels, while other methods optimize the graph structure by assuming neighboring nodes tend to have the same label. To bring into full play the rich information of labels, in this paper, we present a label-enhanced learning framework for GNNs, which first models each label as a virtual center for intra-class nodes and then jointly learns the representations of both nodes and labels. Our approach could not only smooth the representations of nodes belonging to the same class, but also explicitly encode the label semantics into the learning process of GNNs.

By leveraging multiple virtual nodes, the research could lead to advancements in multitask learning and better representation of subgraph structures, which are essential in various applications such as drug discovery and software vulnerability detection. This work could pave the way for more robust models that generalize well across different tasks and datasets, influencing future research directions in graph representation learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to effectively manage the interactions between multiple virtual nodes and the existing graph structure, ensuring that the added nodes enhance rather than complicate the learning process. Naive approaches may fail to capture the intricate relationships within the graph, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge lies in optimizing the representation of these virtual nodes to ensure they contribute meaningfully to the overall graph representation, which requires sophisticated modeling techniques and careful tuning of hyperparameters.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single virtual nodes or traditional feature engineering methods, which may not fully exploit the potential of graph structures. Limitations in computational resources and the complexity of graph dynamics have hindered the exploration of multiple virtual nodes. Additionally, existing models often overlook the importance of capturing long-range dependencies and the roles of nodes within the graph. This proposed approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing a more nuanced method of integrating virtual nodes that enhances the representation learning process.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves augmenting the graph with multiple virtual nodes, each representing different latent aspects of the graph. The model will utilize a combination of GNN architectures, such as Column Networks and Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks, to derive the graph representation. The experiments will be conducted on datasets related to bioactivity prediction and software vulnerability detection, using metrics like AUC and F1-score to evaluate performance.

Nu-\nmerous studies elaborating the stability of materials and\nthe mobility of ions have been conducted using theoret-\nical calculations because these aspects are directly re-\nlated to device performance. To further advance our\nunderstanding of the operating mechanisms of such ion-\nconducting devices, atomic-scale analyses of ionic motion\nin device operating circumstances, that is, under electric\nfields, are crucial.\nAssuming a linear response, external forces arising\nfrom applied electric fields can be estimated simply by\nmultiplying the electric field vector by the valence states\nof the ions.

The prevalent assumption that structural bottlenecks formed by triangularly arranged oxygen atoms at a certain location along the migration path determine the energy barriers for Li migration is not supported by the DFT results.

This research could lead to the discovery of new materials with enhanced ionic mobility, which is essential for improving battery efficiency and longevity. By addressing this question, we can advance the field of materials science and energy storage, potentially leading to practical applications in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to model ionic motion at the atomic scale under dynamic conditions, such as varying electric fields. Traditional methods like DFT are computationally intensive and may not capture the full range of ionic behavior in real-world applications. Naive approaches may overlook the influence of local structural environments and dynamic interactions on ionic migration, leading to inaccurate predictions. Overcoming these challenges requires sophisticated machine learning models that can integrate large datasets and account for the intricate relationships between material structure and ionic conductivity.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on static analyses of ionic migration without considering the dynamic effects of electric fields. Many studies have relied on traditional computational methods that are not scalable for large datasets or complex systems. Additionally, there has been a lack of comprehensive machine learning models that effectively incorporate the nuances of ionic behavior in solid-state electrolytes. Our approach aims to fill this gap by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict ionic motion in real-time under applied electric fields.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose to develop a high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP) model trained on a dataset generated from density functional theory (DFT) calculations of various solid-state electrolyte materials. The methodology will involve constructing a neural network architecture that captures the relationship between atomic configurations and ionic conductivity. We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as root-mean-square error (RMSE) for energy and forces, and compare the predicted ionic conductivities with experimental data.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \nIntroduction\n\nImprovements in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education have accelerated the shift from teaching and assessing facts to developing students\u2019 conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills (NGSS 2013). To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

Especially after breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLM), there is immense potential to automate rapid assessment and feedback of text-based responses in education. This systematic review adopts a scientific and reproducible literature search strategy based on the PRISMA process using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to study text-based automatic assessment systems in post-secondary education, screening 838 papers and synthesizing 93 studies. To understand how text-based automatic assessment systems have been developed and applied in education in recent years, three research questions are considered. All included studies are summarized and categorized according to a proposed comprehensive framework, including the input and output of the system, research motivation, and research outcomes, aiming to answer the research questions accordingly. Additionally, the typical studies of automated assessment systems, research methods, and application domains in these studies are investigated and summarized. This systematic review provides an overview of recent educational applications of text-based assessment systems for understanding the latest AI/NLP developments assisting in text-based assessments in higher education. Findings will particularly benefit researchers and educators incorporating LLMs such as ChatGPT into their educational activities.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16151v2\", \"timestamp\": 1693415805, \"domain\": \"cs.CY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"8de58077-d95c-4e41-b122-08946e60d264\", \"authors\": [\"Marcus Messer\", \"Neil C.

We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation and evaluation techniques.   Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages.   Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.   In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools' performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders.   However, because the evaluation dataset is frequently unavailable, it is more difficult to reproduce results and compare tools to a collection of common assignments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11722v2\", \"timestamp\": 1687283690, \"domain\": \"cs.SE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7bcf3c33-b31c-44f4-af67-2b00055606ea\", \"authors\": [\"Hunter McNichols\", \"Wanyong Feng\", \"Jaewook Lee\", \"Alexander Scarlatos\", \"Digory Smith\", \"Simon Woodhead\", \"Andrew Lan\"], \"title\": \"Automated Distractor and Feedback Generation for Math Multiple-choice Questions via In-context Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are ubiquitous in almost all levels of education since they are easy to administer, grade, and are a reliable form of assessment. An important aspect of MCQs is the distractors, i.e., incorrect options that are designed to target specific misconceptions or insufficient knowledge among students. To date, the task of crafting high-quality distractors has largely remained a labor-intensive process for teachers and learning content designers, which has limited scalability. In this work, we explore the task of automated distractor and corresponding feedback message generation in math MCQs using large language models. We establish a formulation of these two tasks and propose a simple, in-context learning-based solution. Moreover, we propose generative AI-based metrics for evaluating the quality of the feedback messages. We conduct extensive experiments on these tasks using a real-world MCQ dataset. Our findings suggest that there is a lot of room for improvement in automated distractor and feedback generation; based on these findings, we outline several directions for future work.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03234v2\", \"timestamp\": 1691370184, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can Large Language Models (LLMs) be effectively utilized to automate the grading and feedback generation for formative assessments in K-12 STEM education, particularly in science subjects where understanding and reasoning are critical?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the significant challenge teachers face in providing timely and meaningful feedback to students, which is essential for their learning and development in STEM fields. Automating this process could lead to more efficient teaching practices, allowing educators to focus on instruction rather than administrative tasks. This research could pave the way for future studies on the integration of AI in education, potentially transforming assessment methods and enhancing student learning outcomes.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to accurately assess open-ended responses that vary widely in structure and vocabulary. Naive approaches may fail due to the nuanced understanding required to evaluate reasoning and conceptual understanding in student responses. Additionally, the integration of LLMs into existing educational frameworks poses technical challenges, such as ensuring the models are trained on relevant datasets and can provide contextually appropriate feedback.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has largely focused on automated grading in more structured contexts, such as programming or multiple-choice questions, leaving a gap in the application of these technologies to open-ended science assessments. Barriers include the lack of suitable datasets for training LLMs in this specific context and the complexity of developing models that can understand and evaluate reasoning in student responses. This research aims to fill this gap by leveraging recent advancements in LLMs and focusing on the unique challenges of science education.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves using GPT-4 for automated grading and feedback generation in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. The approach will include developing a dataset of student responses, applying in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning techniques, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and feedback quality.

The primary goal is to search the Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative game such that each player has no incentive to deviate from the equilibrium under its private objective. Meanwhile, the agents can coordinate to optimize the social cost within the set of Nash equilibria of the underlying game. Such an optimal Nash equilibrium problem can be modeled as a distributed optimization problem with variational inequality constraints. We consider the scenario where the objective functions of both the underlying game and social cost optimization problem have a special aggregation structure. Since each player only has access to its local objectives while cannot know all players' decisions, a distributed algorithm is highly desirable. By utilizing the Tikhonov regularization and dynamical averaging tracking technique, we propose a distributed coordination algorithm by introducing an incentive term in addition to the gradient-based Nash equilibrium seeking, so as to intervene players' decisions to improve the system efficiency.

By developing robust methods to handle these issues, we can enhance the reliability and efficiency of optimization algorithms, leading to better decision-making processes in complex systems. This research could pave the way for future studies on more intricate optimization scenarios, ultimately contributing to advancements in both theoretical and practical aspects of numerical analysis.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges in addressing unboundedness and infeasibility stem from the complexity of the underlying mathematical structures and the potential for divergence in iterative methods. Naive approaches may fail due to the lack of strict feasibility or the inability to identify optimal solutions in the presence of infinite variables. Additionally, the need for specialized embedding techniques and penalization strategies complicates the development of effective algorithms, requiring a deep understanding of both theoretical and computational aspects of optimization.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on specific classes of optimization problems without adequately addressing the general cases of unboundedness and infeasibility. Limitations in existing algorithms, such as their reliance on strict feasibility conditions or their inability to adapt to varying problem structures, have hindered progress. Our approach aims to integrate advanced embedding techniques and dynamic penalization strategies, which have not been fully explored in prior work, thereby offering a more comprehensive solution to these challenges.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a novel methodology that combines advanced interior-point methods with dynamic embedding techniques to tackle unbounded and infeasible optimization problems. The approach will involve the development of a new algorithm that incorporates adaptive penalization strategies based on the problem's characteristics. We will utilize benchmark datasets from existing literature to evaluate the performance of our method, measuring convergence rates and solution accuracy against traditional algorithms.

Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered.

Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead. Comprehensive evaluations show that Virtual Context-assisted jailbreak attacks can improve the success rates of four widely used jailbreak methods by approximately 40% across various LLMs. Additionally, applying Virtual Context to original malicious behaviors still achieves a notable jailbreak effect.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new task, knowledge-to-jailbreak, which aims to generate jailbreaks from domain knowledge to evaluate the safety of LLMs when applied to those domains.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce VulLLM, a novel framework that integrates multi-task learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively mine deep-seated vulnerability features.

For example, developers routinely engage with program analysis to detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions within repositories. In addition, the widely-used benchmark datasets generally contain only intra-procedural vulnerabilities, leaving the assessment of inter-procedural vulnerability detection capabilities unexplored.   To mitigate the issues, we propose a repository-level evaluation system, named \\\\textbf{VulEval}, aiming at evaluating the detection performance of inter- and intra-procedural vulnerabilities simultaneously.

In this paper, we present RealVul, the first LLM-based framework designed for PHP vulnerability detection, addressing these issues. By vulnerability candidate detection methods and employing techniques such as normalization, we can isolate potential vulnerability triggers while streamlining the code and eliminating unnecessary semantic information, enabling the model to better understand and learn from the generated vulnerability samples.

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing. In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection. Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code. Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.   Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity. Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size. We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs. On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities.

Understanding and improving jailbreak techniques can lead to better security measures, enhancing the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. This research could inform future studies on LLM defenses and contribute to the development of more robust models that can resist malicious exploitation, ultimately advancing the field of AI safety.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to navigate the intricate safety mechanisms of LLMs while crafting inputs that appear benign. Naive approaches may fail because they might trigger the model's safety filters or lack the subtlety required for multi-turn interactions. Additionally, the challenge lies in understanding the model's response patterns and exploiting them without raising alarms, which requires a deep understanding of both the model's architecture and its training data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-turn jailbreaks or those that require significant computational resources and white-box access to the models. The lack of exploration into multi-turn interactions and benign input strategies has left a gap in understanding how to effectively bypass safety measures without detection. Our approach differs by emphasizing the gradual manipulation of the model's responses through a series of innocuous prompts, which has not been extensively studied in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur methodology involves implementing the Crescendo technique, which utilizes a series of benign inputs to guide the model towards generating harmful content. We will evaluate this approach against various state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, using a dataset of tasks designed to test the effectiveness of the jailbreak. Metrics for success will include the rate of successful jailbreaks and the ability to maintain the model's functionality across different modalities.

This model satisfies a desirable counterfactual monotonicity condition, which is sufficient to identify counterfactual dynamics in the process of thinning. Then, given an observed realization of a temporal point process with a given intensity function, we develop a sampling algorithm that uses the above causal model of thinning and the superposition theorem to simulate counterfactual realizations of the temporal point process under a given alternative intensity function.

The prediction performance is evaluated based on extensive experiments covering both spatial and temporal predictions, and the improvement achieved by the combined spatio-temporal predictor. The experiment results show that the NMSE of the spatio-temporal predictor is maintained below 0.1 for all investigate regions of Beijing.

By addressing this problem, we can develop more accurate predictive models that account for the intricate relationships between events over time. This advancement could lead to better decision-making tools and interventions in critical areas such as disease outbreak management and resource allocation in smart grids.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of temporal point processes arises from their inherent stochastic nature and the need to model dependencies between events that may occur at varying time scales. Naive approaches often fail to capture these dependencies, leading to oversimplified models that do not reflect real-world dynamics. Additionally, the computational challenges associated with estimating parameters in high-dimensional spaces and the need for robust validation methods complicate the modeling process.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on simpler models that do not adequately account for the multifaceted interactions present in real-world data.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), built upon auto-regressive transformer\u00a0(Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017; OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et\u00a0al., 2022; Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023), have demonstrated dominance in natural language generation due to the incredible context modeling and scalability. Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2. We partially follow the scaling rule proposed in the previous works\u00a0(Sun et\u00a0al., 2024; Tian et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\n\nModel\nParameters\n\nInter-Blocks N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N\n\n\nIntra-Blocks L\ud835\udc3fLitalic_L\n\n\nWidths w\ud835\udc64witalic_w\n\n\nHeads h\u210ehitalic_h\n\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-B\n343M\n24\n2\n1024\n16\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-L\n804M\n36\n3\n1280\n20\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-XL\n1.5B\n48\n4\n1536\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Method\n\n\n2.1 Overview\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2 is composed of two significant stages.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

By fusing on the channels, the model is able to more effectively align the tokens compared to standard methods. These multimodal representations, which we call compound tokens are generated with cross-attention transformer layers. First, vision tokens are used as queries to retrieve compatible text tokens through cross-attention. We then chain the vision tokens and the queried text tokens along the channel dimension. We call the resulting representations compound tokens. A second group of compound tokens are generated using an analogous process where the text tokens serve as queries to the cross-attention layer. We concatenate all the compound tokens for further processing with multimodal encoder.

However, these tokens are less discriminative as they are independent of the pre-trained tokens and fail to capture input-specific knowledge, such as class-aware textual or instance-aware visual knowledge. Leveraging the discriminative and generalization capabilities inherent in pre-trained tokens, we introduce a novel approach named Self-Enhanced Prompt Tuning (SEP). The core principle of SEP involves adapting the learnable prompt tokens at each encoder layer from the corresponding self-pretrained tokens, thereby explicitly incorporating discriminative prior knowledge to enhance both textual-level and visual-level embeddings. Furthermore, SEP's self-enhanced tokens not only boost discrimination but also mitigate domain shifts in unseen domains, enhancing generalization. In practice, SEP selects several representative tokens from all pre-trained tokens for each input data at every layer of the text/visual encoders. Subsequently, a Token Fusion Module (TFM) is introduced to generate a self-enhanced token by merging these representative tokens with the learnable tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. This self-enhanced token is then concatenated with all pre-trained tokens, serving as input for subsequent encoder layers to produce the relevant embeddings. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks and tasks confirm SEP's efficacy in prompt tuning.

Current approaches straightforwardly convert video into language tokens and employ large language models for multi-modal tasks. However, this method often leads to the generation of irrelevant content, commonly known as \\\"hallucination\\\", as the length of the text increases and the impact of the video diminishes. To address this problem, we propose Vista-LLaMA, a novel framework that maintains the consistent distance between all visual tokens and any language tokens, irrespective of the generated text length. Vista-LLaMA omits relative position encoding when determining attention weights between visual and text tokens, retaining the position encoding for text and text tokens. This amplifies the effect of visual tokens on text generation, especially when the relative distance is longer between visual and text tokens. The proposed attention mechanism significantly reduces the chance of producing irrelevant text related to the video content. Furthermore, we present a sequential visual projector that projects the current video frame into tokens of language space with the assistance of the previous frame. This approach not only captures the temporal relationship within the video, but also allows less visual tokens to encompass the entire video. Our approach significantly outperforms various previous methods (e.g., Video-ChatGPT, MovieChat) on four challenging open-ended video question answering benchmarks.

However, the visual modules introduces new challenges in terms of robustness for LVLMs, as attackers can craft adversarial images that are visually clean but may mislead the model to generate incorrect answers. In general, LVLMs rely on vision encoders to transform images into visual tokens, which are crucial for the language models to perceive image contents effectively. Therefore, we are curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when the encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information? To this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack (Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple perspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature representations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties of visual tokens output by image encoders. Using only access to the image encoder in the proposed attack, the generated adversarial examples exhibit transferability across diverse LVLMs utilizing the same image encoder and generality across different tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superior attack performance of the VT-Attack over baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in attacking LVLMs with image encoders, which in turn can provide guidance on the robustness of LVLMs, particularly in terms of the stability of the visual feature space.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06699v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728464816, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"911905dd-3509-4ac9-a2f7-f35b362671eb\", \"authors\": [\"Jia Ning\", \"Chen Li\", \"Zheng Zhang\", \"Zigang Geng\", \"Qi Dai\", \"Kun He\", \"Han Hu\"], \"title\": \"All in Tokens: Unifying Output Space of Visual Tasks via Soft Token\", \"abstract\": \"Unlike language tasks, where the output space is usually limited to a set of tokens, the output space of visual tasks is more complicated, making it difficult to build a unified visual model for various visual tasks. In this paper, we seek to unify the output space of visual tasks, so that we can also build a unified model for visual tasks. To this end, we demonstrate a single unified model that simultaneously handles two typical visual tasks of instance segmentation and depth estimation, which have discrete/fixed-length and continuous/varied-length outputs, respectively. We propose several new techniques that take into account the particularity of visual tasks: 1) Soft token. We employ soft token to represent the task output. Unlike hard tokens in the common VQ-VAE which are assigned one-hot to discrete codebooks/vocabularies, the soft token is assigned softly to the codebook embeddings. Soft token can improve the accuracy of both the next token inference and decoding of the task output; 2) Mask augmentation. Many visual tasks have corruption, undefined or invalid values in label annotations, i.e., occluded area of depth maps. We show that a mask augmentation technique can greatly benefit these tasks. With these new techniques and other designs, we show that the proposed general-purpose task-solver can perform both instance segmentation and depth estimation well.

Thus, it works for greedy decoding but is incompatible with sampling-based decoding which is crucial for visual quality and diversity in the current auto-regressive text-to-image generation. In this paper, we propose a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm, Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD), to accelerate auto-regressive text-to-image generation. By introducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the inference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the randomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate diverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple tokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion, enabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional next-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization strategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve the acceleration ratio under specific scenarios.

The encoder aims at synthesizing real-like visual features while the decoder forces both the real and the synthesized visual features to be more related to the class semantics.

However, with the growing number of massive datasets, generating visualizations in interactive timescales is increasingly challenging. One approach for improving the speed of the visualization tool is via data reduction in order to reduce the computational overhead, but at a potential cost in visualization accuracy. Common data reduction techniques, such as uniform and stratified sampling, do not exploit the fact that the sampled tuples will be transformed into a visualization for human consumption.   We propose a visualization-aware sampling (VAS) that guarantees high quality visualizations with a small subset of the entire dataset. We validate our method when applied to scatter and map plots for three common visualization goals: regression, density estimation, and clustering. The key to our sampling method's success is in choosing tuples which minimize a visualization-inspired loss function. Our user study confirms that optimizing this loss function correlates strongly with user success in using the resulting visualizations. We also show the NP-hardness of our optimization problem and propose an efficient approximation algorithm. Our experiments show that, compared to previous methods, (i) using the same sample size, VAS improves user's success by up to 35% in various visualization tasks, and (ii) VAS can achieve a required visualization quality up to 400 times faster.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03921v2\", \"timestamp\": 1444776696, \"domain\": \"cs.DB\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent6", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"b8e508da-3c55-4613-9351-2003bfcb5a70\", \"authors\": [\"Yao Teng\", \"Han Shi\", \"Xian Liu\", \"Xuefei Ning\", \"Guohao Dai\", \"Yu Wang\", \"Zhenguo Li\", \"Xihui Liu\"], \"title\": \"Accelerating Auto-regressive Text-to-Image Generation with Training-free Speculative Jacobi Decoding\", \"abstract\": \"The current large auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, high-resolution images, but these models require hundreds or even thousands of steps of next-token prediction during inference, resulting in substantial time consumption.

Compared with the SOTA methods, this approach achieves up to 5.3% and 9.6% in FITB score and 22.3% and 31.8% SFID improvement on fashion and furniture, respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09119v1\", \"timestamp\": 1692294954, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we enhance the performance of auto-regressive visual generation models by improving the tokenizer's efficiency and effectiveness?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nImproving the tokenizer in auto-regressive visual generation models is crucial because it directly impacts the quality of generated images. Current models often lag behind diffusion-based methods due to limitations in tokenizer performance. By addressing this issue, we can advance the state-of-the-art in visual generation, leading to more realistic and diverse image outputs. This research could pave the way for practical applications in fields such as computer graphics, virtual reality, and automated content creation, ultimately influencing future research directions in multimodal AI.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of designing a tokenizer that can effectively handle a super-large codebook while maintaining high reconstruction performance. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate relationships between visual tokens and the need for efficient encoding and decoding processes. Additionally, achieving a balance between model scalability and generation quality presents a significant technical obstacle, as existing tokenizers often struggle with codebook size and utilization.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either improving the auto-regressive models or the tokenizers in isolation, leading to a lack of integrated solutions that address both aspects simultaneously. The closed-source nature of advanced tokenizers like MAGVIT-v2 has also limited access to effective methodologies. Our approach aims to replicate and open-source a powerful tokenizer while exploring its integration with auto-regressive models, thus providing a novel perspective that combines both elements for enhanced performance.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves two key components: 1) the open-source replication of the Lookup-Free Quantizer to create a highly efficient tokenizer with a super-large codebook, and 2) the integration of this tokenizer into an auto-regressive model using asymmetric token factorization and next sub-token prediction to enhance generation quality. We will evaluate our approach using standard visual generation datasets like ImageNet, measuring performance through metrics such as reconstruction fidelity (rFID).

However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for Big Data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages. In this work, we present a thorough review of approaches for automating data processing tasks in deep learning pipelines, including automated data preprocessing--e.g., data cleaning, labeling, missing data imputation, and categorical data encoding--as well as data augmentation (including synthetic data generation using generative AI methods) and feature engineering--specifically, automated feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection.

Having an automated system for surgical skills assessment could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There have been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using either video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an analysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer data). Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for basic surgical skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and accelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce \\\"entropy based\\\" features - Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy (XApEn), which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of fluctuations in time-series data. The proposed features are compared to existing methods of Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for surgical skills assessment. Results: We report average performance of different features across all applicable OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows that the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art methods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better for suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features can improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving highest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be achieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system can significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical schools and teaching hospitals.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07772v1\", \"timestamp\": 1487971831, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9cf228c0-fb28-4f04-91fc-12d3ceb63242\", \"authors\": [\"Aneeq Zia\", \"Irfan Essa\"], \"title\": \"Automated Surgical Skill Assessment in RMIS Training\", \"abstract\": \"Purpose: Manual feedback in basic RMIS training can consume a significant amount of time from expert surgeons' schedule and is prone to subjectivity. While VR-based training tasks can generate automated score reports, there is no mechanism of generating automated feedback for surgeons performing basic surgical tasks in RMIS training. In this paper, we explore the usage of different holistic features for automated skill assessment using only robot kinematic data and propose a weighted feature fusion technique for improving score prediction performance.   Methods: We perform our experiments on the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset and evaluate four different types of holistic features from robot kinematic data - Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn). The features are then used for skill classification and exact skill score prediction. Along with using these features individually, we also evaluate the performance using our proposed weighted combination technique.   Results: Our results demonstrate that these holistic features outperform all previous HMM based state-of-the-art methods for skill classification on the JIGSAWS dataset. Also, our proposed feature fusion strategy significantly improves performance for skill score predictions achieving up to 0.61 average spearman correlation coefficient.

To transform the way of feature selection, we regard a selected feature subset as a selection decision token sequence and reformulate feature selection as a deep sequential generative learning task that distills feature knowledge and generates decision sequences.

This research could lead to more efficient machine learning pipelines, enabling practitioners to handle larger and more complex datasets without extensive manual intervention. By addressing this question, we can advance knowledge in automated machine learning (AutoML) and potentially develop tools that facilitate better decision-making in various applications, from finance to healthcare.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the high-dimensional nature of tabular data, where many features may be redundant or irrelevant.

This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07571v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728529923, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"28c15f41-7759-4059-b5f9-6f5b67fa94e9\", \"authors\": [\"Wenxuan Zhang\", \"Philip H.

However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during the fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In the supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark including comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO eliminates the need for human prompting and annotation in LLM fine-tuning while achieving the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor, with less than 10% of the computational resources.

Furthermore, we give our hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk. Finally, we analyze potential mitigation measures.

This paper presents a formal approach to carrying out privacy preserving text perturbation using the notion of dx-privacy designed to achieve geo-indistinguishability in location data. Our approach applies carefully calibrated noise to vector representation of words in a high dimension space as defined by word embedding models. We present a privacy proof that satisfies dx-privacy where the privacy parameter epsilon provides guarantees with respect to a distance metric defined by the word embedding space. We demonstrate how epsilon can be selected by analyzing plausible deniability statistics backed up by large scale analysis on GloVe and fastText embeddings. We conduct privacy audit experiments against 2 baseline models and utility experiments on 3 datasets to demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and utility for varying values of epsilon on different task types. Our results demonstrate practical utility (< 2% utility loss for training binary classifiers) while providing better privacy guarantees than baseline models.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08902v1\", \"timestamp\": 1571548343, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"38660577-8451-4ba6-a75a-82f514df5a5d\", \"authors\": [\"Haoran Li\", \"Yulin Chen\", \"Jinglong Luo\", \"Jiecong Wang\", \"Hao Peng\", \"Yan Kang\", \"Xiaojin Zhang\", \"Qi Hu\", \"Chunkit Chan\", \"Zenglin Xu\", \"Bryan Hooi\", \"Yangqiu Song\"], \"title\": \"Privacy in Large Language Models: Attacks, Defenses and Future Directions\", \"abstract\": \"The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the ability to effectively tackle various downstream NLP tasks and unify these tasks into generative pipelines.

On the other hand, unrestricted access to these models can also introduce potential malicious and unintentional privacy risks. Despite ongoing efforts to address the safety and privacy concerns associated with LLMs, the problem remains unresolved. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current privacy attacks targeting LLMs and categorize them according to the adversary's assumed capabilities to shed light on the potential vulnerabilities present in LLMs. Then, we present a detailed overview of prominent defense strategies that have been developed to counter these privacy attacks.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate personality traits, the relationship between personality traits and safety abilities in LLMs still remains a mystery. In this paper, we discover that LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities, i.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness, based on the reliable MBTI-M scale. Meanwhile, the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits. According to such findings, we can edit LLMs' personality traits and improve their safety performance, e.g., inducing personality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of approximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance, respectively. Additionally, we find that LLMs with different personality traits are differentially susceptible to jailbreak.

Improving the balance between safety and helpfulness can lead to more responsible AI systems, fostering greater public trust and wider adoption. This research could pave the way for innovative methodologies that enhance LLMs' performance while ensuring they adhere to ethical standards, ultimately influencing future research directions in AI alignment and safety.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent trade-offs between safety and helpfulness during the fine-tuning of LLMs. Naive approaches may fail because they often prioritize one aspect over the other, leading to models that are either overly cautious (and thus less helpful) or too permissive (and thus unsafe). Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated evaluation metrics that accurately capture both safety and helpfulness, as well as the complexity of designing training protocols that can effectively integrate safety measures without degrading model performance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either enhancing model performance or ensuring safety, often treating these objectives as mutually exclusive. Existing solutions may lack comprehensive frameworks that address the dual objectives simultaneously. Barriers include limited understanding of how safety measures impact model behavior and the absence of robust datasets that capture the nuances of safety and helpfulness. Our approach aims to integrate insights from recent studies on safety degradation during fine-tuning and propose a unified framework that balances both objectives.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new fine-tuning framework that incorporates a dual-objective optimization strategy, leveraging a dataset that includes diverse safety and helpfulness scenarios. We will employ metrics that evaluate both dimensions during training and testing phases. Expected outcomes include a set of LLMs that demonstrate improved performance on safety and helpfulness benchmarks, along with a detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved.

By advancing the methodologies for detecting anomalies at the graph level, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of systems that rely on graph data, leading to better decision-making and risk management.

Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of graph data and the need for effective representation learning.

Another limitation of multilingual sentence encoders is the trade-off between monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Training for cross-lingual alignment of sentence embeddings distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks. In this work, we address both issues by modular training of sentence encoders, i.e., by separating monolingual specialization from cross-lingual alignment. We first efficiently train language-specific sentence encoders to avoid negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English monolingual encoders to the English encoder by training a cross-lingual alignment adapter on top of each, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. In both steps, we resort to contrastive learning on machine-translated paraphrase data. Monolingual and cross-lingual evaluations on semantic text similarity/relatedness and multiple-choice QA render our modular solution more effective than multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14878v1\", \"timestamp\": 1721483799, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a24f18d3-84f8-48c3-b7fc-2d3b55778987\", \"authors\": [\"Hanan Aldarmaki\", \"Mona Diab\"], \"title\": \"Context-Aware Cross-Lingual Mapping\", \"abstract\": \"Cross-lingual word vectors are typically obtained by fitting an orthogonal matrix that maps the entries of a bilingual dictionary from a source to a target vector space.

Recent trends in learning both mono-lingual and multi-lingual sentence embeddings are mainly based on contrastive learning (CL) among an anchor, one positive, and multiple negative instances. In this work, we argue that leveraging multiple positives should be considered for multi-lingual sentence embeddings because (1) positives in a diverse set of languages can benefit cross-lingual learning, and (2) transitive similarity across multiple positives can provide reliable structural information for learning. In order to investigate the impact of multiple positives in CL, we propose a novel approach, named MPCL, to effectively utilize multiple positive instances to improve the learning of multi-lingual sentence embeddings. Experimental results on various backbone models and downstream tasks demonstrate that MPCL leads to better retrieval, semantic similarity, and classification performances compared to conventional CL.

A successful approach could lead to more effective multilingual applications such as document retrieval, question answering, and machine translation. This research could pave the way for future studies on unsupervised learning techniques and improve the accessibility of NLP technologies across diverse languages, ultimately fostering inclusivity in AI applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of aligning sentence embeddings from different languages without sufficient parallel data. Naive approaches may fail due to the risk of overfitting to the source language or misalignment of semantic meanings across languages. Additionally, the lack of robust evaluation metrics for cross-lingual tasks complicates the assessment of model performance. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can effectively leverage existing data while ensuring the embeddings remain semantically coherent across languages.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on supervised methods that rely heavily on large amounts of parallel data, which is often unavailable for many languages. Additionally, existing models may suffer from the \"curse of multilinguality,\" where the performance on individual languages is compromised for the sake of cross-lingual alignment. Our approach aims to address these limitations by utilizing contrastive learning techniques on English data to create universal embeddings, thus reducing dependency on parallel datasets and improving cross-lingual transfer capabilities.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a methodology that extends the SimCSE framework to a multilingual context (mSimCSE) by employing contrastive learning on English data to generate high-quality universal cross-lingual sentence embeddings. The dataset will include English Wikipedia and NLI tuples, with performance metrics focusing on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks.

A desirable property of GNNs is transferability, where a trained network can swap in information from a different graph without retraining and retain its accuracy. A recent method of capturing transferability of GNNs is through the use of graphons, which are symmetric, measurable functions representing the limit of large dense graphs. In this work, we contribute to the application of graphons to GNNs by presenting an explicit two-layer graphon neural network (WNN) architecture. We prove its ability to approximate bandlimited graphon signals within a specified error tolerance using a minimal number of network weights. We then leverage this result, to establish the transferability of an explicit two-layer GNN over all sufficiently large graphs in a convergent sequence. Our work addresses transferability between both deterministic weighted graphs and simple random graphs and overcomes issues related to the curse of dimensionality that arise in other GNN results.

Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks.

Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot address the main space and computational bottleneck in GNNs, caused by the size and connectivity of the graph. To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification (UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale graphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular lottery ticket hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph lottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core sub-dataset and sparse sub-network, which can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full dense graph by iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural networks, GLT can be trained in isolation to match the performance of training with the full model and graph, and can be drawn from both randomly initialized and self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been experimentally verified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Specifically, for node classification, our found GLTs achieve the same accuracies with 20%~98% MACs saving on small graphs and 25%~85% MACs saving on large ones.

Such operations are time-consuming and do not scale to large graphs. In this paper, we propose an efficient GNN framework called Geodesic GNN (GDGNN) that requires only one GNN run and injects conditional relationships between nodes into the model without labeling. This strategy effectively reduces the runtime of subgraph methods. Specifically, we view the shortest paths between two nodes as the spatial graph context of the neighborhood around them. The GNN embeddings of nodes on the shortest paths are used to generate geodesic representations. Conditioned on the geodesic representations, GDGNN can generate node, link, and graph representations that carry much richer structural information than plain GNNs. We theoretically prove that GDGNN is more powerful than plain GNNs.

However, (i) Most scalable GNNs tend to treat all nodes in graphs with the same propagation rules, neglecting their topological uniqueness; (ii) Existing node-wise propagation optimization strategies are insufficient on web-scale graphs with intricate topology, where a full portrayal of nodes' local properties is required. Intuitively, different nodes in web-scale graphs possess distinct topological roles, and therefore propagating them indiscriminately or neglect local contexts may compromise the quality of node representations. This intricate topology in web-scale graphs cannot be matched by small-scale scenarios. To address the above issues, we propose \\\\textbf{A}daptive \\\\textbf{T}opology-aware \\\\textbf{P}ropagation (ATP), which reduces potential high-bias propagation and extracts structural patterns of each node in a scalable manner to improve running efficiency and predictive performance. Remarkably, ATP is crafted to be a plug-and-play node-wise propagation optimization strategy, allowing for offline execution independent of the graph learning process in a new perspective. Therefore, this approach can be seamlessly integrated into most scalable GNNs while remain orthogonal to existing node-wise propagation optimization strategies. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets, including the most representative large-scale ogbn-papers100M, have demonstrated the effectiveness of ATP. Specifically, ATP has proven to be efficient in improving the performance of prevalent scalable GNNs for semi-supervised node classification while addressing redundant computational costs.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06128v1\", \"timestamp\": 1707441587, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"02483856-60dd-4b11-b96a-c854cc888ec8\", \"authors\": [\"Xiang Li\", \"Dong Li\", \"Ruoming Jin\", \"Gagan Agrawal\", \"Rajiv Ramnath\"], \"title\": \"Scalable Deep Graph Clustering with Random-walk based Self-supervised Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Web-based interactions can be frequently represented by an attributed graph, and node clustering in such graphs has received much attention lately. Multiple efforts have successfully applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), though with some limits on accuracy as GCNs have been shown to suffer from over-smoothing issues. Though other methods (particularly those based on Laplacian Smoothing) have reported better accuracy, a fundamental limitation of all the work is a lack of scalability. This paper addresses this open problem by relating the Laplacian smoothing to the Generalized PageRank and applying a random-walk based algorithm as a scalable graph filter. This forms the basis for our scalable deep clustering algorithm, RwSL, where through a self-supervised mini-batch training mechanism, we simultaneously optimize a deep neural network for sample-cluster assignment distribution and an autoencoder for a clustering-oriented embedding. Using 6 real-world datasets and 6 clustering metrics, we show that RwSL achieved improved results over several recent baselines. Most notably, we show that RwSL, unlike all other deep clustering frameworks, can continue to scale beyond graphs with more than one million nodes, i.e., handle web-scale. We also demonstrate how RwSL could perform node clustering on a graph with 1.8 billion edges using only a single GPU.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15530v2\", \"timestamp\": 1640967143, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent5", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"de423b58-99b1-4818-8aeb-0ab679df5b1c\", \"authors\": [\"Xingyu Liu\", \"Juan Chen\", \"Quan Wen\"], \"title\": \"A Survey on Graph Classification and Link Prediction based on GNN\", \"abstract\": \"Traditional convolutional neural networks are limited to handling Euclidean space data, overlooking the vast realm of real-life scenarios represented as graph data, including transportation networks, social networks, and reference networks.

A flexible dataset can facilitate the exploration of different embedding techniques, graph sizes, and multi-class classification tasks, ultimately leading to improved model performance and generalization. This work could also inspire new methodologies in GNN training and evaluation, impacting various applications such as fraud detection, recommendation systems, and molecular structure prediction.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of graph data, which varies significantly in structure and size. Existing datasets often lack sufficient labeled data, making it difficult to train GNNs effectively. Naive approaches may fail due to the need for diverse graph representations and the ability to maintain homophily across different graph sizes. Additionally, the scalability of GNNs is affected by the unique topological properties of large graphs, which require tailored solutions for effective training and evaluation.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on small-scale datasets or specific applications, leading to a lack of comprehensive datasets that cater to the diverse needs of GNN research.

Improving the trainability of QML models could lead to significant advancements in various fields such as quantum materials, biochemistry, and high-energy physics. A successful approach could pave the way for more efficient algorithms that leverage quantum advantages, thus influencing future research directions and practical applications in quantum computing.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing the trainability of QML models stem from the inherent noise and errors present in NISQ devices, which can lead to difficulties in model convergence and performance. Naive approaches may fail due to the complex interplay between quantum states and classical optimization techniques, which are not directly compatible. Additionally, the theoretical understanding of how to effectively train quantum models remains limited, requiring innovative strategies to overcome these obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on developing quantum algorithms without adequately addressing the practical limitations of NISQ devices. The lack of robust frameworks for training QML models in noisy environments has hindered progress. Existing solutions often overlook the need for hybrid approaches that combine classical and quantum techniques effectively. Our approach aims to integrate advanced optimization methods and error mitigation strategies to improve the training process, distinguishing it from prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid quantum-classical training framework that utilizes advanced optimization algorithms tailored for NISQ environments. We will employ datasets relevant to quantum materials and biochemistry, focusing on metrics such as model accuracy and convergence speed. Expected outcomes include improved performance of QML models on NISQ devices, demonstrating their practical applicability and paving the way for future research in quantum-enhanced machine learning.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 56628, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 3}}

These capabilities can be partly explained if LLMs understand basic time series concepts. However, our knowledge of what these models understand about time series data remains relatively limited. To address this gap, we introduce TimeSeriesExam, a configurable and scalable multiple-choice question exam designed to assess LLMs across five core time series understanding categories: pattern recognition, noise understanding, similarity analysis, anomaly detection, and causality analysis. TimeSeriesExam comprises of over 700 questions, procedurally generated using 104 carefully curated templates and iteratively refined to balance difficulty and their ability to discriminate good from bad models. We test 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on the TimeSeriesExam and provide the first comprehensive evaluation of their time series understanding abilities. Our results suggest that closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini understand simple time series concepts significantly better than their open-source counterparts, while all models struggle with complex concepts such as causality analysis.

A successful approach could lead to more accurate forecasting models, which would enhance decision-making processes in these fields. Furthermore, this research could pave the way for future studies on adaptive modeling techniques that leverage multi-scale correlations, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust machine learning frameworks.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the intricate nature of inter-series correlations that can vary significantly across different time scales. Naive approaches may fail to capture these dynamics due to their inability to adapt to the underlying structure of the data. Additionally, the complexity of designing models that can effectively learn from high-dimensional data while maintaining interpretability poses significant technical and theoretical obstacles. Overcoming these challenges requires innovative methodologies that can integrate frequency domain analysis and advanced neural network architectures.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on either intra-series dependencies or static inter-series correlations, neglecting the dynamic nature of these relationships across time scales. Existing models may lack the flexibility to adapt to varying correlation structures, leading to suboptimal performance. Barriers such as limited computational resources and the complexity of model design have also hindered progress. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by introducing a novel framework that combines frequency domain analysis with adaptive graph convolution techniques, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of multivariate time series.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a deep learning model, MSGNet, which utilizes frequency domain analysis to extract periodic patterns and adaptive graph convolution to learn inter-series correlations. We will apply this model to several real-world datasets, measuring its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean square error.

Improved data augmentation techniques can lead to better generalization of models, which is essential for real-world applications across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. A paper addressing this question could pave the way for future research on automated augmentation methods, potentially leading to more robust models that require less manual tuning and domain expertise.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to balance effective data augmentation with the preservation of label integrity. Naive approaches may lead to transformations that alter the underlying class information, resulting in degraded model performance. Additionally, the interaction between different augmentation techniques and their impact on model optimization is not well understood, making it challenging to develop a unified framework. Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated algorithms to automate the augmentation process and the difficulty in evaluating the effectiveness of various augmentation strategies.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on specific augmentation techniques without a comprehensive understanding of their effects on model performance and label preservation. Many studies have not adequately addressed the distribution gap between clean and augmented data, leading to suboptimal results. Barriers include a lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating augmentation methods and the complexity of integrating automated techniques into existing workflows.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, access to molecular forces has become an essential aspect in various applications such as geometry optimization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\u00a0(Jensen, 2010).\nHowever, the underlying quantum mechanical (QM) calculations required for these predictions are computationally demanding.\nIn order to reduce this computational burden, graph neural networks (GNNs) fitted to QM data have been proposed as a means to accelerate MD simulations\u00a0(Chmiela et\u00a0al., 2017; Sch\u00fctt et\u00a0al., 2018).\nWhile such surrogates have recently achieved exceptional reproduction of the dataset they have been trained on, they tend to perform poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) data (Li et\u00a0al., 2022). In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

Here, we performed a theoretical analysis to tackle this question. We show that in general AM-AFM measurements, the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope whereas the conventional equation is only valid for excitation exactly at the resonance frequency.

However, in previous experimental studies, the effects of state-dependent alignment have never been included in estimates of the optical dipole force acting on the molecules while previous theoretical investigations took the state-dependent molecular alignment into account only implicitly. Herein, we consider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end, introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular alignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole force. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the optical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole force, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could be based. We note that an analogous analysis of the forces acting on polar molecules subject to an inhomogeneous static electric field reveals a similarly strong dependence on molecular orientation.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00516v1\", \"timestamp\": 1464830262, \"domain\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b0fbd1dd-7fc3-42b1-b9b8-3d80191f8398\", \"authors\": [\"Narendra Nath Patra\"], \"title\": \"Molecular scale height in spiral galaxies\", \"abstract\": \"Having to have low thermal energy, the molecular gas in galaxies is expected to settle in a thin disc near the midplane. However, contradicting this understanding, recent studies have revealed considerably thick molecular discs in nearby spiral galaxies. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we theoretically model the molecular discs in a sample of eight nearby spiral galaxies and estimate their molecular scale heights (Half Width at Half Maxima (HWHM)). We assume that the baryonic discs are in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under their mutual gravity in the external force field of the dark matter halo. We set up the joint Poisson's-Boltzman equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and numerically solve it to obtain the three-dimensional molecular gas distribution and determine the scale heights in our sample galaxies. We find that the scale heights follow a universal exponential law with a scale length of $0.46 \\\\pm 0.01 \\\\ r_{25}$. The molecular scale heights in our sample galaxies are found to vary between 50-200 pc depending on the galaxy and radius. Using the density solutions, we build dynamical models of the molecular discs and produce molecular column density maps. These model maps found to match to the observed ones reasonably well. We further incline the dynamical models to an inclination of 90$^o$ to estimate the expected observed thickness of the molecular discs. Interestingly it is found that at edge-on orientation, our sample galaxies under hydrostatic assumption can easily produce a few kpc thick observable molecular disc.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13053v1\", \"timestamp\": 1588010413, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f5db1438-161d-4c91-804e-3dcfa0becee0\", \"authors\": [\"Dvira Segal\", \"Abraham Nitzan\", \"Peter Hanggi\"], \"title\": \"Thermal conductance through molecular wires\", \"abstract\": \"We consider phononic heat transport through molecular chains connecting two thermal reservoirs. For relatively short molecules at normal temperatures heat conduction is dominated by the harmonic part of the molecular force-field. We develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in 3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms) chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order of magnitude at room temperature.

Reliable predictions can lead to better understanding of molecular interactions and properties, facilitating the design of new materials and drugs. This research could pave the way for more accurate simulations that account for the inherent uncertainties in molecular data, ultimately influencing future research directions and practical applications in various scientific fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of accurately modeling molecular interactions and the limitations of existing uncertainty estimation methods, which often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data. Naive approaches may overlook the physical constraints and intricacies of molecular systems, leading to unreliable predictions. Additionally, the need for high computational resources and the difficulty in obtaining comprehensive training datasets further complicate the development of robust models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on improving predictive accuracy without adequately addressing uncertainty quantification. Many existing methods do not satisfy the specific physical and application-focused requirements necessary for molecular force fields. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate uncertainty estimation with predictive modeling, as well as insufficient exploration of the unique challenges posed by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing a new framework that combines Gaussian Processes with Graph Neural Networks to meet all necessary desiderata.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a methodology that integrates Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process-based extension to existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, to enhance uncertainty estimation in molecular force fields. The approach will involve training on a diverse dataset of molecular configurations and forces, with metrics such as AUC-ROC scores to evaluate performance. We expect that our method will yield significantly lower prediction errors for out-of-distribution data, thereby improving the reliability of molecular dynamics simulations and enabling more accurate modeling of molecular systems.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

On the\none hand, numerous old problems have been revisited with\ndeep neural networks and huge progress has been made in\nmany tasks previously seemed out of reach, such as machine\ntranslation and computer vision. On the other hand, new\ntechniques such as geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al.\n2017) are being developed to generalize deep neural models\nto new or non-traditional domains.\nIt is well known that training a deep neural model typi-\ncally requires a large amount of labeled data, which cannot\nbe satis\ufb01ed in many scenarios due to the high cost of labeling\ntraining data. To reduce the amount of data needed for train-\ning, a recent surge of research interest has focused on few-\nshot learning (Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum 2015;\nRezende et al. 2016) \u2013 to learn a classi\ufb01cation model with\nvery few examples from each class. Closely related to few-\nshot learning is semi-supervised learning, where a large\n\u0003Corresponding author.\nCopyright c\r2018, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

The key issue is\nto maximize the effective utilization of structural and fea-\nture information of unlabeled data. Due to the powerful fea-\nture extraction capability and recent success of deep neu-\nral networks, there have been some successful attempts to\nrevisit semi-supervised learning with neural-network-based\nmodels, including ladder network (Rasmus et al. 2015),\nsemi-supervised embedding (Weston et al. 2008), planetoid\n(Yang, Cohen, and Salakhutdinov 2016), and graph convo-\nlutional networks (Kipf and Welling 2017).\nThe recently developed graph convolutional neural net-\nworks (GCNNs) (Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst\n2016) is a successful attempt of generalizing the power-\nful convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in dealing with\nEuclidean data to modeling graph-structured data. In their\npilot work (Kipf and Welling 2017), Kipf and Welling pro-\nposed a simpli\ufb01ed type of GCNNs, called graph convolu-\ntional networks (GCNs), and applied it to semi-supervised\nclassi\ufb01cation. The GCN model naturally integrates the con-\nnectivity patterns and feature attributes of graph-structured\ndata, and outperforms many state-of-the-art results of other baselines are\ncopied from (Kipf and Welling 2017). Our Experiments\nIn this section, we conduct extensive Results Analysis\nThe classi\ufb01cation Conclusions\nUnderstanding deep neural networks is crucial for realiz-\ning their full potentials in real applications. This paper con-\ntributes to the understanding of the GCN model and its appli-\ncation in semi-supervised classi\ufb01cation. Our analysis not\nonly reveals the mechanisms and limitations of the GCN\nmodel, but also leads to new solutions overcoming its limits.\nIn future work, we plan to develop new convolutional \ufb01lters\nwhich are compatible with deep architectures, and exploit\nadvanced deep learning techniques to improve the perfor-\nmance of GCNs for more graph-based applications.

GraphHeat achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification across three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16002v1\", \"timestamp\": 1595850832, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we develop a more effective graph convolutional network (GCN) that dynamically learns optimal graph structures for semi-supervised learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the limitations of existing GCNs that rely on fixed graph structures, which may not be optimal for all datasets. By improving the adaptability of GCNs, this research could significantly enhance the performance of semi-supervised learning across various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. This work could pave the way for future research into more flexible and efficient learning algorithms that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data more effectively.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of dynamically learning graph structures that accurately represent the underlying data relationships while simultaneously performing classification tasks. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricate dependencies between nodes and the need for real-time adjustments to the graph structure based on incoming data. Additionally, there are technical obstacles related to computational efficiency and the need for robust algorithms that can handle large-scale graphs without sacrificing performance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on static graph structures, which limits their applicability in diverse scenarios. Existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between model complexity and performance, leading to either overfitting or underutilization of available data. Additionally, the lack of unified frameworks that integrate graph learning with convolutional operations has hindered progress. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel architecture that simultaneously learns optimal graph structures and performs semi-supervised learning, thus improving upon prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a Graph Learning-Convolutional Network (GLCN) that integrates graph learning and convolutional operations in a unified framework. We will utilize benchmark datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed for evaluation. The key metrics for assessing performance will include classification accuracy and computational efficiency. We expect that our approach will demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional GCNs by effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to improved semi-supervised learning outcomes.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 55611, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 5, "agent3": 6}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 3}}

While recent advancements in text-to-avatar generation have yielded diverse human avatars from text prompts, these methods typically combine all elements-clothes, hair, and body-into a single 3D representation. Such an entangled approach poses challenges for downstream tasks like editing or animation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel disentangled 3D avatar representation named Sequentially Offset-SMPL (SO-SMPL), building upon the SMPL model. SO-SMPL represents the human body and clothes with two separate meshes but associates them with offsets to ensure the physical alignment between the body and the clothes. Then, we design a Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based distillation framework to generate the proposed SO-SMPL representation from text prompts. Our approach not only achieves higher texture and geometry quality and better semantic alignment with text prompts, but also significantly improves the visual quality of character animation, virtual try-on, and avatar editing.

Text2Avatar leverages a discrete codebook as an intermediate feature to establish a connection between text and avatars, enabling the disentanglement of features. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of realistic style 3D human avatar data, we utilize a pre-trained unconditional 3D human avatar generation model to obtain a large amount of 3D avatar pseudo data, which allows Text2Avatar to achieve realistic style generation.

To address these limitations, we propose AvatarStudio, a coarse-to-fine generative model that generates explicit textured 3D meshes for animatable human avatars. Specifically, AvatarStudio begins with a low-resolution NeRF-based representation for coarse generation, followed by incorporating SMPL-guided articulation into the explicit mesh representation to support avatar animation and high resolution rendering. To ensure view consistency and pose controllability of the resulting avatars, we introduce a 2D diffusion model conditioned on DensePose for Score Distillation Sampling supervision. By effectively leveraging the synergy between the articulated mesh representation and the DensePose-conditional diffusion model, AvatarStudio can create high-quality avatars from text that are ready for animation, significantly outperforming previous methods. Moreover, it is competent for many applications, e.g., multimodal avatar animations and style-guided avatar creation.

In this work, we propose ParDy-Human (Parameterized Dynamic Human Avatar), a fully explicit approach to construct a digital avatar from as little as a single monocular sequence. ParDy-Human introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method is composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians according to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their designed joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with dynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a rasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic human avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our avatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be trained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images efficiently even on consumer hardware.

In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\\\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\\\"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from in-the-wild images.

We first build low-dimensional latent spaces for the human and avatar facial expressions with variational autoencoder.

A user-friendly method is proposed to automatically generate triplets for a system allowing users to easily and efficiently annotate the correspondences.

This limitation in prior work stems from their requirement of face tracking, which fails for profile and back views. To address this issue, we propose to learn person-specific animatable avatars from images without assuming to have access to precise facial expression tracking. At the core of our method, we leverage a 3D-aware generative model that is trained to reproduce the distribution of facial expressions from the training data. To train this appearance model, we only assume to have a collection of 2D images with the corresponding camera parameters. For controlling the model, we learn a mapping from 3DMM facial expression parameters to the latent space of the generative model. This mapping can be learned by sampling the latent space of the appearance model and reconstructing the facial parameters from a normalized frontal view, where facial expression estimation performs well. With this scheme, we decouple 3D appearance reconstruction and animation control to achieve high fidelity in image synthesis.

In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\\\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\\\"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from in-the-wild images.

Furthermore, it could lead to significant advancements in machine learning techniques for 3D modeling and animation, influencing future research directions in avatar generation and animation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges include the limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the input video, which complicates the generation of novel animations. Additionally, the absence of 3D observations, such as scans or depth data, introduces ambiguity in occluded body parts, leading to artifacts in the generated avatars. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of accurately capturing and animating nuanced human expressions and movements without sufficient data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious methods often relied on extensive datasets with 3D scans or multi-view images, which are impractical for casual video capture.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28]. However, the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

In addition, we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real environments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09133v1\", \"timestamp\": 1540196459, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve the detection of anomalous sounds in industrial machinery using unsupervised learning techniques that account for the variability in normal sound distributions across different machines?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nImproving anomalous sound detection (ASD) is crucial for enhancing predictive maintenance in industrial settings, which can lead to reduced downtime and maintenance costs. This research could significantly impact the field by providing a more robust method for detecting anomalies without the need for extensive labeled datasets, thus advancing the state of the art in machine learning applications for industrial monitoring. It could also lead to practical applications in various industries, improving safety and operational efficiency.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges include the high variability of normal sounds across different machines, which can obscure the distinction between normal and anomalous sounds. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for this variability, leading to high false positive rates. Additionally, the lack of available anomalous sound samples for training complicates the development of effective models, necessitating innovative unsupervised learning techniques that can generalize well across different operational contexts.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on supervised learning methods that require labeled anomalous data, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised methods may not adequately address the distribution differences of normal sounds from various machines, leading to poor detection performance. Our approach aims to leverage machine identity information and advanced feature extraction techniques to improve the robustness of anomaly detection, addressing the limitations of prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel unsupervised learning framework that incorporates machine identity as a condition for feature encoding. We will utilize a dataset of normal sounds from various machines and apply advanced techniques such as group masked autoencoders and attention mechanisms to enhance feature representation. The performance will be evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall scores. We expect our approach to yield improved detection rates of anomalous sounds while maintaining low false positive rates, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world industrial applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 54480, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 3, "agent3": 4}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022).

The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Transformers-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs and RNNs to unify fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Compared with independent data samples such as images, videos or texts, graphs usually contain rich structural and relational information. Meanwhile, language, especially natural language, being one of the most expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing work on incorporating graph problems into the generative language modeling framework remains very limited. Considering the rising prominence of LLMs, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also replace GNNs as the foundation model for graphs. In this paper, we propose InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model) with highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions. We use natural language to describe multi-scale geometric structure of the graph and then instruction finetune an LLM to perform graph tasks, which enables Generative Graph Learning.

The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies. In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present ULTRA, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. ULTRA builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions. Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained ULTRA model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph. Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the zero-shot inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained ULTRA model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs.

In this paper, we investigate k-connectivity of random graphs in the node fault model by evaluating the network breakdown probability, i.e., the disconnectivity probability of random graphs after stochastic node removals. Using the notion of a strongly typical set, we obtain universal asymptotic upper and lower bounds of the network breakdown probability. The bounds are applicable both to random graphs and to random geometric graphs. We then consider three representative random graph ensembles: the Erdos-Renyi random graph as the simplest case, the random intersection graph for WSNs with random key predistribution schemes, and the random geometric graph as a model of WSNs generated by random sensor node deployment. The bounds unveil the existence of the phase transition of the network breakdown probability for those ensembles.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02818v1\", \"timestamp\": 1515480777, \"domain\": \"cs.IT\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"bf190fef-f19e-46fe-8da6-08a37ea1700d\", \"authors\": [\"Elizabeth Beer\", \"James Allen Fill\", \"Svante Janson\", \"Edward R.

This advancement would not only streamline the development of AI systems but also foster interdisciplinary research, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and their intersections. A successful model could significantly reduce the need for task-specific models, thereby simplifying deployment and maintenance in real-world applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of integrating diverse modalities (language and vision) into a single model while ensuring optimal performance across all tasks. Naive approaches may fail due to the distinct nature of data and tasks involved, which require specialized handling and training techniques. Additionally, achieving a balance between model size, training efficiency, and generalization capabilities poses significant technical and theoretical obstacles. The need for extensive and diverse datasets for training further complicates the development process.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on optimizing models for specific tasks, leading to a lack of comprehensive approaches that address the integration of multiple modalities. Limitations in computational resources, data availability, and the complexity of designing training methodologies that cater to various tasks have hindered progress. Existing models often prioritize performance in one area at the expense of others, making it difficult to achieve a truly general foundation model. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging innovative training techniques and architectures that facilitate cross-modal learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new general foundation model, termed X-FM, which incorporates a unified architecture with separate encoders for language and vision, along with a fusion encoder. We will utilize a diverse dataset comprising text, images, and image-text pairs for training, employing techniques such as gradient stopping and guided learning to enhance performance. Metrics for evaluation will include accuracy across various benchmark datasets for language, vision, and vision-language tasks.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely.

We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of age stereotypes as a voice disguise strategy, as a follow up to our recent work where 60 native Finnish speakers attempted to sound like an elderly and like a child. In that study, we presented evidence that both ASV and human observers could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable the presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The interesting cases would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV system, and which a typical listener cannot detect as being a disguise. We carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) crowd-workers. A total of 91 listeners participated in the test and were instructed to estimate both the speaker's chronological and intended age. The results indicate that age estimations for the intended old and child voices for female speakers were towards the target age groups, while for male speakers, the age estimations corresponded to the direction of the target voice only for elderly voices. In the case of intended child's voice, listeners estimated the age of male speakers to be older than their chronological age for most of the speakers and not the intended target age.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08910v2\", \"timestamp\": 1524560825, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"8338c25a-8d23-424d-8088-df02a963ebbb\", \"authors\": [\"Ouba\\u00efda Chouchane\", \"Michele Panariello\", \"Oualid Zari\", \"Ismet Kerenciler\", \"Imen Chihaoui\", \"Massimiliano Todisco\", \"Melek \\u00d6nen\"], \"title\": \"Differentially Private Adversarial Auto-Encoder to Protect Gender in Voice Biometrics\", \"abstract\": \"Over the last decade, the use of Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems has become increasingly widespread in response to the growing need for secure and efficient identity verification methods. The voice data encompasses a wealth of personal information, which includes but is not limited to gender, age, health condition, stress levels, and geographical and socio-cultural origins. These attributes, known as soft biometrics, are private and the user may wish to keep them confidential. However, with the advancement of machine learning algorithms, soft biometrics can be inferred automatically, creating the potential for unauthorized use. As such, it is crucial to ensure the protection of these personal data that are inherent within the voice while retaining the utility of identity recognition. In this paper, we present an adversarial Auto-Encoder--based approach to hide gender-related information in speaker embeddings, while preserving their effectiveness for speaker verification.

This research could lead to advancements in speaker recognition technology, enabling systems to better handle variations in voice due to aging. It may also inform the development of more robust ASV systems that can adapt to demographic changes, ultimately enhancing user trust and system effectiveness.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complex interplay between aging and voice characteristics, which can vary significantly across individuals and languages. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the nuanced effects of aging on voice features, such as pitch and timbre. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive datasets that capture a wide range of ages and conditions complicates the modeling process. Overcoming these obstacles requires sophisticated statistical methods and large, diverse datasets to accurately assess the aging effects on ASV performance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on single languages or limited datasets, neglecting the broader implications of aging across different demographics. Additionally, many studies have not adequately addressed the interaction between gender and aging effects on ASV systems. Barriers include insufficient data on aging voices and a lack of comprehensive models that can account for the variability introduced by age. This research aims to fill these gaps by utilizing multiple datasets and considering gender differences in the analysis.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves using linear mixed effect models to analyze ASV scores across different age groups, genders, and languages. The study will utilize the VoxCeleb and LCFSH datasets to assess the impact of aging on ASV performance. Key metrics will include equal error rate (EER) and ASV scores, with a focus on understanding how these metrics vary with age differences.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures.

To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

An additional benefit of this method is the ability to extend graph neural networks to inputs of dynamic sized graphs.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10042v2\", \"timestamp\": 1551199182, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"327623a2-7bdf-48b2-9a88-34f3712a848c\", \"authors\": [\"Shima Khoshraftar\", \"Aijun An\"], \"title\": \"A Survey on Graph Representation Learning Methods\", \"abstract\": \"Graphs representation learning has been a very active research area in recent years. The goal of graph representation learning is to generate graph representation vectors that capture the structure and features of large graphs accurately. This is especially important because the quality of the graph representation vectors will affect the performance of these vectors in downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction and anomaly detection. Many techniques are proposed for generating effective graph representation vectors. Two of the most prevalent categories of graph representation learning are graph embedding methods without using graph neural nets (GNN), which we denote as non-GNN based graph embedding methods, and graph neural nets (GNN) based methods. Non-GNN graph embedding methods are based on techniques such as random walks, temporal point processes and neural network learning methods. GNN-based methods, on the other hand, are the application of deep learning on graph data. In this survey, we provide an overview of these two categories and cover the current state-of-the-art methods for both static and dynamic graphs. Finally, we explore some open and ongoing research directions for future work.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01855v2\", \"timestamp\": 1649107128, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can large language models (LLMs) be effectively utilized to refine graph structures by identifying and addressing noisy connections and uncovering implicit node-wise dependencies in graph-structured data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the limitations of current graph structure learning methods that rely heavily on explicit graph structures, which can be noisy or sparse in real-world applications. By leveraging LLMs, this research could lead to more robust and accurate graph representations, enhancing various downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. This advancement could significantly impact the fields of social network analysis, recommender systems, and any domain that utilizes graph-structured data, paving the way for future research on integrating LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs).\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of accurately identifying and correcting noisy connections in graphs, especially when the underlying data is sparse or contains biases. Naive approaches may fail because they might not effectively capture the intricate relationships and dependencies within the graph data. Additionally, integrating LLMs with GNNs requires overcoming technical hurdles related to model compatibility, data representation, and ensuring that the learning process remains efficient and interpretable.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on explicit graph structures and often overlooked the potential of LLMs in refining these structures. Limitations include a lack of methodologies that effectively combine LLMs with GNNs and insufficient exploration of how textual data associated with nodes can enhance graph learning. Our approach differs by explicitly integrating LLMs into the graph structure learning process, aiming to utilize the rich contextual information from textual data to improve graph representation.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a model called GraphEdit that utilizes LLMs to analyze and refine graph structures. We will use datasets from social networks and recommender systems, focusing on metrics such as accuracy in node classification and the reduction of noise in graph connections. The expected outcomes include improved graph representations that better capture implicit dependencies and enhanced performance in downstream tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating LLMs with GNNs for graph structure learning.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 51597, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 3, "agent3": 3}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere.

Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders.

The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024].

Improved forecasting capabilities can have significant implications for disaster preparedness, environmental management, and policy-making. This research could pave the way for future studies that leverage foundation models in other scientific domains, enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in optimizing foundation models for atmospheric forecasting include the complexity of atmospheric processes, the variability of data sources, and the need for models to generalize across different conditions. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate interactions within the atmosphere that are not easily captured by standard modeling techniques. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality training data in certain regions or conditions poses a significant obstacle to model performance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often relied on traditional numerical weather prediction methods that do not fully utilize the potential of large datasets. Limitations in computational resources and the lack of integrated models that can handle diverse data types have hindered progress. Our approach differs by employing advanced foundation models that can learn from vast amounts of heterogeneous data, thus addressing the shortcomings of earlier methods and providing a more holistic view of atmospheric dynamics.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves fine-tuning the Aurora model using a diverse dataset that includes historical weather data, satellite observations, and climate simulations. We will implement Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to enhance model efficiency. Metrics for evaluation will include forecast accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness in extreme weather predictions.

Cybersecurity is a notable application area, where defending networks against sophisticated adversaries remains a challenging task typically performed by teams of security operators. In this work, we explore novel MARL strategies for building autonomous cyber network defenses that address challenges such as large policy spaces, partial observability, and stealthy, deceptive adversarial strategies. To facilitate efficient and generalized learning, we propose a hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture that decomposes the cyber defense task into specific sub-tasks like network investigation and host recovery. Our approach involves training sub-policies for each sub-task using PPO enhanced with domain expertise. These sub-policies are then leveraged by a master defense policy that coordinates their selection to solve complex network defense tasks. Furthermore, the sub-policies can be fine-tuned and transferred with minimal cost to defend against shifts in adversarial behavior or changes in network settings. We conduct extensive experiments using CybORG Cage 4, the state-of-the-art MARL environment for cyber defense. Comparisons with multiple baselines across different adversaries show that our hierarchical learning approach achieves top performance in terms of convergence speed, episodic return, and several interpretable metrics relevant to cybersecurity, including the fraction of clean machines on the network, precision, and false positives on recoveries.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17351v2\", \"timestamp\": 1729622105, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9d2248c1-b09b-47b3-a0fd-15e90170f405\", \"authors\": [\"Tao Li\", \"Quanyan Zhu\"], \"title\": \"Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare\", \"abstract\": \"We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation.

This capability is necessary for agents to remain effective when deployed in dynamically changing environments, such as an enterprise network where devices may frequently join and leave.   Standard approaches to deep reinforcement learning, where policies are parameterised using a fixed-input multi-layer perceptron (MLP) expect fixed-size observation and action spaces. In autonomous cyber defence, this makes it hard to develop agents that generalise to environments with network topologies different from those trained on, as the number of nodes affects the natural size of the observation and action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we reframe the problem of autonomous network defence using entity-based reinforcement learning, where the observation and action space of an agent are decomposed into a collection of discrete entities. This framework enables the use of policy parameterisations specialised in compositional generalisation. Namely, we train a Transformer-based policy on the Yawning Titan cyber-security simulation environment and test its generalisation capabilities across various network topologies. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an MLP-based policy on fixed networks, and has the ability for zero-shot generalisation to networks of a different size to those seen in training.   These findings highlight the potential for entity-based reinforcement learning to advance the field of autonomous cyber defence by providing more generalisable policies capable of handling variations in real-world network environments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17647v1\", \"timestamp\": 1729670652, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent2", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"b678388f-9dda-42bc-9350-9345e78dc929\", \"authors\": [\"Mingjun Wang\", \"Remington Dechene\"], \"title\": \"Multi-Agent Actor-Critics in Autonomous Cyber Defense\", \"abstract\": \"The need for autonomous and adaptive defense mechanisms has become paramount in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats.

This workshop was organized to share research that explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as foundational capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably and effectively defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats.   Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the adoption of AI and ML techniques to both cyber and non-cyber settings. Bridging critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural shifts in user behavior over time.   The Workshop (held on August 19th and 20th 2021 in Montreal-themed virtual reality) was comprised of technical presentations and a panel discussion focused on open problems and potential research solutions. Workshop submissions were peer reviewed by a panel of domain experts with a proceedings consisting of 10 technical articles exploring challenging problems of critical importance to national and global security.

This research could pave the way for future studies on multi-agent systems and their applications in various domains, ultimately contributing to the development of intelligent, adaptive defenses that can respond to evolving threats.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the dynamic nature of cyber environments, where network topologies can change frequently, making it difficult for agents trained on fixed configurations to perform effectively.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION Neural networks are mathematical models that simulate the way neurons operate in the brain. The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning. In terms of depth improvement, there are neural networks represented by ResNet, Inception, and DenseNet; in terms of channel information utilization improvement, there are neural networks represented by SENet and ShuffleNet; in terms of attention improvement, there are neural networks\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning.

By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning. In terms of depth improvement, there are neural networks represented by ResNet, Inception, and DenseNet; in terms of channel information utilization improvement, there are neural networks represented by SENet and ShuffleNet; in terms of attention improvement, there are neural networks\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Due to the large data scale in histology, deep learning methods play an increasingly significant role as feature extractors. Existing solutions heavily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for global pixel-level analysis, leaving the underlying local geometric structure such as the interaction between cells in the tumor microenvironment unexplored. The topological structure in medical images, as proven to be closely related to tumor evolution, can be well characterized by graphs. To obtain a more comprehensive representation for downstream oncology tasks, we propose a fusion framework for enhancing the global image-level representation captured by CNNs with the geometry of cell-level spatial information learned by graph neural networks (GNN). The fusion layer optimizes an integration between collaborative features of global images and cell graphs. Two fusion strategies have been developed: one with MLP which is simple but turns out efficient through fine-tuning, and the other with Transformer gains a champion in fusing multiple networks. We evaluate our fusion strategies on histology datasets curated from large patient cohorts of colorectal and gastric cancers for three biomarker prediction tasks. Both two models outperform plain CNNs or GNNs, reaching a consistent AUC improvement of more than 5% on various network backbones.

In medical imaging, expert manual segmentation often relies on organ boundaries; for example, to manually segment a liver, a medical practitioner usually identifies edges first and subsequently fills in the segmentation mask. Motivated by these observations, we propose a plug-and-play module, dubbed Edge-Gated CNNs (EG-CNNs), that can be used with existing encoder-decoder architectures to process both edge and texture information. The EG-CNN learns to emphasize the edges in the encoder, to predict crisp boundaries by an auxiliary edge supervision, and to fuse its output with the original CNN output.

The Spectral and Temporal Attention modules assign the weights of different frequency bands and temporal slices respectively. Our method is adaptive as well as efficient which can be fit into 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) as a plug-in module. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. 3D-CNN combined with our module achieves promising results and demonstrate that the PST-Attention is able to capture stable patterns for emotion recognition from EEG.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09955v2\", \"timestamp\": 1634126616, \"domain\": \"eess.SP\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"240a5863-37e2-4696-86f2-34047cdc579c\", \"authors\": [\"Yihan Wu\", \"Min Xia\", \"Li Nie\", \"Yangsong Zhang\", \"Andong Fan\"], \"title\": \"Simultaneously exploring multi-scale and asymmetric EEG features for emotion recognition\", \"abstract\": \"In recent years, emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) has received growing interests in the brain-computer interaction (BCI) field. The neuroscience researches indicate that the left and right brain hemispheres demonstrate activity differences under different emotional activities, which could be an important principle for designing deep learning (DL) model for emotion recognition. Besides, owing to the nonstationarity of EEG signals, using convolution kernels of a single size may not sufficiently extract the abundant features for EEG classification tasks. Based on these two angles, we proposed a model termed Multi-Scales Bi-hemispheric Asymmetric Model (MSBAM) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. Evaluated on the public DEAP and DREAMER datasets, MSBAM achieved over 99% accuracy for the two-class classification of low-level and high-level states in each of four emotional dimensions, i.e., arousal, valence, dominance and liking, respectively.

This research could pave the way for advancements in AI-driven healthcare solutions, enabling better detection of diseases through improved image analysis. Additionally, it may inspire future research into hybrid models that combine the strengths of CNNs with other neural network architectures, potentially leading to breakthroughs in various fields beyond medical imaging.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing CNNs stem from their inherent vulnerability to noise and their difficulty in generalizing across diverse datasets. Naive approaches may fail due to the complex nature of medical images, which often contain subtle features that are critical for accurate diagnosis. Moreover, the integration of different neural network architectures (e.g., combining CNNs with graph neural networks) introduces additional complexities in model training and optimization, requiring careful consideration of how to effectively merge features from different data representations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on improving CNN architectures without adequately addressing their limitations in noise sensitivity and generalization. Many existing solutions do not leverage the potential of combining CNNs with other models, such as graph neural networks, to capture spatial relationships in medical images. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive datasets that reflect the variability in medical imaging and insufficient exploration of hybrid models that could enhance feature extraction and representation.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid model that integrates CNNs with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance feature extraction from medical images. The model will be trained on large-scale medical imaging datasets, focusing on tasks such as lesion detection and classification. Metrics for evaluation will include accuracy, AUC (Area Under the Curve), and F1 score to assess performance improvements.

Traditional in-situ monitoring approach utilizes a single sensor (i.e., acoustic, visual, or thermal sensor) to capture the complex process dynamic behaviors, which is insufficient for defect detection with high accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a novel multimodal sensor fusion method for real-time location-dependent defect detection in the robotic L-DED process. The multimodal fusion sources include a microphone sensor capturing the laser-material interaction sound and a visible spectrum CCD camera capturing the coaxial melt pool images. A hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to fuse acoustic and visual data. The key novelty in this study is that the traditional manual feature extraction procedures are no longer required, and the raw melt pool images and acoustic signals are fused directly by the hybrid CNN model, which achieved the highest defect prediction accuracy (98.5 %) without the thermal sensing modality.

We argue that this effect is largely due to the inadvertent relaxation of the training objectives on individual modalities when using fusion, what others have termed modality laziness. We present a nuanced point-of-view that this relaxation can lead to certain modalities failing to fully harness available task-relevant information, and yet, offers a protective veil to noisy modalities, preventing them from overfitting to task-irrelevant data.

In this paper, a Self-Adjusting Fusion Representation Learning Model (SA-FRLM) is proposed to learn robust crossmodal fusion representations directly from the unaligned text and audio sequences. Different from previous works, our model not only makes full use of the interaction between different modalities but also maximizes the protection of the unimodal characteristics. Specifically, we first employ a crossmodal alignment module to project different modalities features to the same dimension. The crossmodal collaboration attention is then adopted to model the inter-modal interaction between text and audio sequences and initialize the fusion representations. After that, as the core unit of the SA-FRLM, the crossmodal adjustment transformer is proposed to protect original unimodal characteristics. It can dynamically adapt the fusion representations by using single modal streams. We evaluate our approach on the public multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

We find that the main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text outputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with errors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of the ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key sentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words, which makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of multimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the sentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically refine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues. Specifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to obtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then utilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine the sentiment word embeddings.

In general, current multimodal sentiment analysis datasets usually follow the traditional system of sentiment/emotion, such as positive, negative and so on. However, when applied in the scenario of video recommendation, the traditional sentiment/emotion system is hard to be leveraged to represent different contents of videos in the perspective of visual senses and language understanding. Based on this, we propose a multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, named baiDu Video Sentiment dataset (DuVideoSenti), and introduce a new sentiment system which is designed to describe the sentimental style of a video on recommendation scenery. Specifically, DuVideoSenti consists of 5,630 videos which displayed on Baidu, each video is manually annotated with a sentimental style label which describes the user's real feeling of a video. Furthermore, we propose UNIMO as our baseline for DuVideoSenti. Experimental results show that DuVideoSenti brings new challenges to multimodal sentiment analysis, and could be used as a new benchmark for evaluating approaches designed for video understanding and multimodal fusion.

Contrary to previous works in multimodal sentiment analysis which focus on holistic information in speech segments such as bag of words representations and average facial expression intensity, we develop a novel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs modality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated Multimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is composed of 2 modules. The Gated Multimodal Embedding alleviates the difficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal Attention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input modalities and attends to the most important time steps. As a result, the GME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through time and perform better sentiment comprehension.

a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief

     You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDeep probabilistic State Space Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe evaluate\u00a0KalMamba\u00a0on several tasks from the DeepMind Control (DMC) Suite\u00a0[50], training an off-the-shelf Soft Actor-Critic\u00a0[21] on beliefs inferred from both images\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a

A successful integration of probabilistic and deterministic models could lead to more effective decision-making in real-world applications such as robotics, where uncertainty and long sequences are prevalent. This research could pave the way for new methodologies that enhance the performance of RL agents, ultimately influencing future research directions and practical implementations in various domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in effectively merging the strengths of probabilistic models, which excel in uncertainty representation, with the computational efficiency of deterministic models. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent complexities of probabilistic inference and the need for scalable algorithms that can handle long sequences. Technical obstacles include developing efficient algorithms for filtering and smoothing that maintain the integrity of probabilistic beliefs while ensuring computational feasibility in real-time applications.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either probabilistic or deterministic models, often overlooking the potential benefits of a hybrid approach. Limitations in existing solutions include inadequate handling of uncertainty in deterministic models and scalability issues in probabilistic models.

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata.

To fill this gap, we propose Knowledge Adaptation, an extension of Knowledge Distillation (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) to the domain adaptation scenario. We show how a student model achieves state-of-the-art results on unsupervised domain adaptation from multiple sources on a standard sentiment analysis benchmark by taking into account the domain-specific expertise of multiple teachers and the similarities between their domains.   When learning from a single teacher, using domain similarity to gauge trustworthiness is inadequate.

A number of effective domain adaptation approaches rely on the ability to extract discriminative, yet domain-invariant, latent factors which are common to both domains. Extracting latent commonality is also useful for disentanglement analysis, enabling separation between the common and the domain-specific features of both domains. In this paper, we present a method for boosting domain adaptation performance by leveraging disentanglement analysis. The key idea is that by learning to separately extract both the common and the domain-specific features, one can synthesize more target domain data with supervision, thereby boosting the domain adaptation performance. Better common feature extraction, in turn, helps further improve the disentanglement analysis and disentangled synthesis. We show that iterating between domain adaptation and disentanglement analysis can consistently improve each other on several unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, for various domain adaptation backbone models.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08019v1\", \"timestamp\": 1526906597, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent3", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"ec416236-46a0-478c-bf9a-a1d2f1faa0da\", \"authors\": [\"Mohammad Mahfujur Rahman\", \"Clinton Fookes\", \"Sridha Sridharan\"], \"title\": \"Preserving Semantic Consistency in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Using Generative Adversarial Networks\", \"abstract\": \"Unsupervised domain adaptation seeks to mitigate the distribution discrepancy between source and target domains, given labeled samples of the source domain and unlabeled samples of the target domain.

A successful approach could enhance the generalization of models across diverse environments, leading to improved performance in critical applications. This research could pave the way for future studies on continuous domain adaptation, enabling models to adapt to new domains without extensive retraining or labeled data, thus fostering practical applications in various fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the absence of continuous metadata, which complicates the determination of the transfer order of intermediate domains. Additionally, significant domain shifts can lead to cumulative errors during the adaptation process. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the complex relationships between domains or the need for a structured adaptation strategy. Overcoming these obstacles requires sophisticated methods to measure divergence and manage the adaptation process effectively.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either adapting to a specific domain or generalizing to unseen domains, often neglecting the interplay between these two aspects. Existing methods may lack the flexibility to handle continuous domain shifts effectively, especially in the absence of reliable metadata. Our approach aims to integrate domain adaptation and generalization in a complementary manner, addressing the limitations of prior work by leveraging advanced techniques such as Wasserstein distance for divergence measurement and optimal transport for effective adaptation.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a framework that combines domain adaptation and generalization through a model-agnostic approach. We will utilize datasets from various domains, applying metrics such as accuracy and generalization error to evaluate performance. The expected outcomes include improved adaptation to new domains while retaining knowledge from previous domains, leading to a robust model capable of handling significant domain shifts effectively.

LLM unlearning aims at reducing their influence and avoid undesirable behaviours. However, existing unlearning methods remain vulnerable to adversarial queries and the unlearned knowledge resurfaces after the manually designed attack queries. As part of a red-team effort to proactively assess the vulnerabilities of unlearned models, we design Dynamic Unlearning Attack (DUA), a dynamic and automated framework to attack these models and evaluate their robustness. It optimizes adversarial suffixes to reintroduce the unlearned knowledge in various scenarios. We find that unlearned knowledge can be recovered in $55.2\\\\%$ of the questions, even without revealing the unlearned model's parameters. In response to this vulnerability, we propose Latent Adversarial Unlearning (LAU), a universal framework that effectively enhances the robustness of the unlearned process. It formulates the unlearning process as a min-max optimization problem and resolves it through two stages: an attack stage, where perturbation vectors are trained and added to the latent space of LLMs to recover the unlearned knowledge, and a defense stage, where previously trained perturbation vectors are used to enhance unlearned model's robustness. With our LAU framework, we obtain two robust unlearning methods, AdvGA and AdvNPO. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple unlearning benchmarks and various models, and demonstrate that they improve the unlearning effectiveness by over $53.5\\\\%$, cause only less than a $11.6\\\\%$ reduction in neighboring knowledge, and have almost no impact on the model's general capabilities.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10682v1\", \"timestamp\": 1724146564, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d56d6d0e-22c3-4ee2-a5a5-0d200734e134\", \"authors\": [\"Vyas Raina\", \"Adian Liusie\", \"Mark Gales\"], \"title\": \"Is LLM-as-a-Judge Robust?

Despite these critical applications, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs to adversarial manipulation. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we demonstrate that short universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to deceive judge LLMs to predict inflated scores. Since adversaries may not know or have access to the judge-LLMs, we propose a simple surrogate attack where a surrogate model is first attacked, and the learned attack phrase then transferred to unknown judge-LLMs. We propose a practical algorithm to determine the short universal attack phrases and demonstrate that when transferred to unseen models, scores can be drastically inflated such that irrespective of the assessed text, maximum scores are predicted. It is found that judge-LLMs are significantly more susceptible to these adversarial attacks when used for absolute scoring, as opposed to comparative assessment.

In the first stage, we introduce the hierarchical meta-universal adversarial prompt learning to efficiently and effectively generate token-level adversarial prompts. In the second stage, we propose the automatic adversarial prompt learning to iteratively refine semantic-level adversarial prompts, further enhancing LLM's defense capabilities. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used jailbreak datasets, comparing our framework with six defense baselines under five representative attack scenarios.

Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored.

In this paper, we conduct the first investigation to understand the extent to which machine unlearning can leak the confidential content of the unlearned data. Specifically, under the Machine Learning as a Service setting, we propose unlearning inversion attacks that can reveal the feature and label information of an unlearned sample by only accessing the original and unlearned model. The effectiveness of the proposed unlearning inversion attacks is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various model architectures and on both exact and approximate representative unlearning approaches. The experimental results indicate that the proposed attack can reveal the sensitive information of the unlearned data. As such, we identify three possible defenses that help to mitigate the proposed attacks, while at the cost of reducing the utility of the unlearned model.

Traditionally, the development of unlearning algorithms runs parallel with that of membership inference attacks (MIA), a type of privacy threat to determine whether a data instance was used for training. However, the two strands are intimately connected: one can view machine unlearning through the lens of MIA success with respect to removed data. Recognizing this connection, we propose a game-theoretic framework that integrates MIAs into the design of unlearning algorithms. Specifically, we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs to detect the traces of the ostensibly removed data. Adopting this adversarial perspective allows the utilization of new attack advancements, facilitating the design of unlearning algorithms. Our framework stands out in two ways. First, it takes an adversarial approach and proactively incorporates the attacks into the design of unlearning algorithms. Secondly, it uses implicit differentiation to obtain the gradients that limit the attacker's success, thus benefiting the process of unlearning.

These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their \\\"U-MIA\\\" counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into \\\"population U-MIAs\\\", where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and \\\"per-example U-MIAs\\\", where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the different rates at which examples are unlearned. We demonstrate that naive attempts at tailoring unlearning stopping criteria to different examples fail to alleviate these issues.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01218v3\", \"timestamp\": 1709389360, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent4", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"c325c062-2444-4615-bae2-5262f47e3cac\", \"authors\": [\"Hongbang Yuan\", \"Zhuoran Jin\", \"Pengfei Cao\", \"Yubo Chen\", \"Kang Liu\", \"Jun Zhao\"], \"title\": \"Towards Robust Knowledge Unlearning: An Adversarial Framework for Assessing and Improving Unlearning Robustness in Large Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"LLM have achieved success in many fields but still troubled by problematic content in the training corpora.

Our findings raise concerns on the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge methods, and emphasize the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in LLM assessment methods before deployment in high-stakes real-world scenarios.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14016v2\", \"timestamp\": 1708541720, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"22c718c9-8082-47d0-bb91-9079ae1253ad\", \"authors\": [\"Guang Lin\", \"Qibin Zhao\"], \"title\": \"Large Language Model Sentinel: LLM Agent for Adversarial Purification\", \"abstract\": \"Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly.

Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation.

Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on five models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr, Llama2) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility.

It optimizes adversarial suffixes to reintroduce the unlearned knowledge in various scenarios. We find that unlearned knowledge can be recovered in $55.2\\\\%$ of the questions, even without revealing the unlearned model's parameters. In response to this vulnerability, we propose Latent Adversarial Unlearning (LAU), a universal framework that effectively enhances the robustness of the unlearned process. It formulates the unlearning process as a min-max optimization problem and resolves it through two stages: an attack stage, where perturbation vectors are trained and added to the latent space of LLMs to recover the unlearned knowledge, and a defense stage, where previously trained perturbation vectors are used to enhance unlearned model's robustness. With our LAU framework, we obtain two robust unlearning methods, AdvGA and AdvNPO.

In this paper, we conduct the first investigation to understand the extent to which machine unlearning can leak the confidential content of the unlearned data. Specifically, under the Machine Learning as a Service setting, we propose unlearning inversion attacks that can reveal the feature and label information of an unlearned sample by only accessing the original and unlearned model. The effectiveness of the proposed unlearning inversion attacks is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various model architectures and on both exact and approximate representative unlearning approaches.

Traditionally, the development of unlearning algorithms runs parallel with that of membership inference attacks (MIA), a type of privacy threat to determine whether a data instance was used for training. However, the two strands are intimately connected: one can view machine unlearning through the lens of MIA success with respect to removed data. Recognizing this connection, we propose a game-theoretic framework that integrates MIAs into the design of unlearning algorithms. Specifically, we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs to detect the traces of the ostensibly removed data. Adopting this adversarial perspective allows the utilization of new attack advancements, facilitating the design of unlearning algorithms. Our framework stands out in two ways. First, it takes an adversarial approach and proactively incorporates the attacks into the design of unlearning algorithms. Secondly, it uses implicit differentiation to obtain the gradients that limit the attacker's success, thus benefiting the process of unlearning.

These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their \\\"U-MIA\\\" counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into \\\"population U-MIAs\\\", where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and \\\"per-example U-MIAs\\\", where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the different rates at which examples are unlearned.

This research could lead to advancements in secure AI systems, influencing future studies on adversarial robustness and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the dual requirement of effectively removing specific knowledge from LLMs while simultaneously preventing adversarial exploitation of the unlearning process.

Additionally, the theoretical understanding of how unlearning impacts model behavior is still limited, complicating the design of robust algorithms.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on the efficacy of unlearning methods without adequately addressing their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.

It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints.

In this work, to optimize text-to-image generative models for task specific rewards and enable fast training and inference, we propose a framework for fine-tuning consistency models via RL. Our framework, called Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), frames the iterative inference process of a consistency model as an RL procedure. Comparing to RL finetuned diffusion models, RLCM trains significantly faster, improves the quality of the generation measured under the reward objectives, and speeds up the inference procedure by generating high quality images with as few as two inference steps. Experimentally, we show that RLCM can adapt text-to-image consistency models to objectives that are challenging to express with prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality.

We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\\\\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\\\\alpha$.

Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse.

One major reason is that these diffusion-based approaches typically adopt a simple reconstruction objective during training, which can hardly enforce appropriate structural consistency between the generated and the reference images.

A successful alignment with human preferences could lead to more intuitive and user-friendly systems, fostering greater public trust and acceptance. This research could pave the way for future advancements in generative models, influencing how they are integrated into creative industries and everyday applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in accurately defining and quantifying human preferences, which are inherently subjective and diverse. Existing methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often struggle with stability and require extensive datasets for training reward models. Additionally, the tendency of models to overfit on limited training data can lead to reduced output diversity, making it difficult to achieve a balance between fidelity to prompts and creative variability. Naive approaches may fail to capture the complexity of human preferences and the nuances of generative processes.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on aligning models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, which has been shown to limit output diversity. There has been a lack of exploration into alternative divergence measures that could enhance model performance. Additionally, the complexity of integrating diverse divergence constraints into existing frameworks has hindered progress.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9].

The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill.

This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution.

One is that we can fully leverage the powerful ability of open-set object localization and recognition since no specific fine-tuning is needed for robotic scenarios. Furthermore, the diffusion-based estimator only need to \\\"imagine\\\" the poses of the moving and reference objects after the placement, while no necessity for their semantic information. Thus the training burden is greatly reduced and no massive training is required. The training data for goal pose estimation is collected in simulation and annotated with GPT-4. A set of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach to accomplish general-purpose object rearrangement, placing various objects following precise instructions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01655v1\", \"timestamp\": 1722657185, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"03593e48-60b1-453c-9ed8-988a0ae2339e\", \"authors\": [\"Florian Fuchs\", \"Yunlong Song\", \"Elia Kaufmann\", \"Davide Scaramuzza\", \"Peter Duerr\"], \"title\": \"Super-Human Performance in Gran Turismo Sport Using Deep Reinforcement Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Autonomous car racing is a major challenge in robotics.

In the present work, we propose a learning-based system for autonomous car racing by leveraging a high-fidelity physical car simulation, a course-progress proxy reward, and deep reinforcement learning.

A successful implementation could lead to advancements in robotics, particularly in areas requiring real-time decision-making and physical agility. This research could inspire future studies on complex motor skills in robotics, enhance training methodologies for robots, and lead to practical applications in sports training, rehabilitation, and entertainment.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the need for the robot to master both high-level strategic decision-making and low-level physical skills simultaneously. This dual requirement complicates the learning process, as the robot must adapt to varying ball speeds, spins, and trajectories while also making strategic choices based on the opponent's actions. Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of the state space and the need for precise timing and coordination, which are critical in fast-paced sports like table tennis.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on specific aspects of table tennis, such as ball return or targeted hitting, rather than the full competitive game. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive training environments that simulate real match conditions and the inability to generalize learned skills to new opponents. Our approach aims to integrate a hierarchical and modular policy architecture that allows for the specialization of skills while maintaining adaptability, addressing these gaps in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves creating a hierarchical policy architecture that includes multiple low-level skill policies (e.g., forehand topspin, backhand targeting) and a high-level controller that selects among them based on the game context. We will utilize a combination of reinforcement learning and imitation learning techniques, training the robot in simulated environments that mimic real-world dynamics.

In addition to leveraging ICL for a purely generative task, e.g., question answering or abstractive summarisation (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023), a more common use is in a predictive task, such as text classification (Lu et\u00a0al., 2022; Milios et\u00a0al., 2023), where each class is specified by a set of words (commonly called a verbaliser (Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021)), e.g., for a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could be defined by the set {{\\{{\u2018good\u2019, \u2018great\u2019, \u2018wonderful\u2019\u2026}}\\}}.\nOnce each class for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated text can be mapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over the vocabulary generated by the decoder.\n\n\nIt is to be realised that ICL is somewhat conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples) - the only difference of ICL with k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN is that the former involves a frozen set of encoder-decoder parameters of an underlying LLM, where ICL generally works well on any domain with only a small number of examples because, unlike\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Recently, large foundation vision-language models have shown strong zero-shot performance in various downstream tasks. While these models have learned complex relationships between vision and language, they are not specifically designed for the tasks of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose the Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine (FADE) which leverages the vision-language CLIP model and adjusts it for the purpose of industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, we improve language-guided anomaly segmentation 1) by adapting CLIP to extract multi-scale image patch embeddings that are better aligned with language and 2) by automatically generating an ensemble of text prompts related to industrial anomaly detection. 3) We use additional vision-based guidance from the query and reference images to further improve both zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection.

Moreover, current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper, we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models.

Particularly, our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner, where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover, adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features, the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further, we, for the first time, formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes.

Traditional approaches often treat frequent-shot (freq-shot; labels with abundant instances), few-shot, and zero-shot learning as distinct challenges, optimizing systems for just one of these scenarios. Yet, in real-world settings, label occurrences vary greatly. Some of them might appear thousands of times, while others might only appear sporadically or not at all. For practical deployment, it is crucial that a system can adapt to any label occurrence. We introduce a novel classification challenge: X-shot, reflecting a real-world context where freq-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot labels co-occur without predefined limits. Here, X can span from 0 to positive infinity. The crux of X-shot centers on open-domain generalization and devising a system versatile enough to manage various label scenarios.

This advancement could lead to more efficient training processes, reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets. A paper addressing this could significantly influence future research by providing new methodologies for leveraging LLMs in low-data scenarios, potentially leading to practical applications in fields like healthcare, finance, and education where labeled data is scarce.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of LLMs, which require careful tuning and optimization to adapt to few-shot learning scenarios. Naive approaches may fail due to the models' tendency to overfit on limited examples or to misinterpret the context provided in prompts. Additionally, the lack of robust evaluation metrics for few-shot performance complicates the assessment of improvements. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that effectively balance model capacity and generalization.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on traditional supervised learning paradigms, often neglecting the unique challenges posed by few-shot learning. Existing solutions may not adequately address the nuances of in-context learning or the specific requirements of different NLP tasks. Our approach aims to integrate dependency parsing and multimodal task vectors to enhance the few-shot learning process, which has not been thoroughly explored in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves two main components: (1) leveraging dependency parsing to inform few-shot learning and (2) utilizing Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV) to compress many-shot examples into fewer tokens for efficient processing. We will evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets such as LAMA and CrossFit, measuring performance improvements through metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\u00a0(Krumm et\u00a0al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), news\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2018b) and e-commerce\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2020; Qin et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval.

As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\nIn contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing various feature interaction operators, such as product operators\u00a0(Qu et\u00a0al., 2016), convolutional operators\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2019a), and attention operators\u00a0(Xiao et\u00a0al., 2017).

Off-policy evaluation (OPE) for ranking policies is thus gaining a growing interest because it enables performance estimation of new ranking policies using only logged data. Although OPE in contextual bandits has been studied extensively, its naive application to the ranking setting faces a critical variance issue due to the huge item space. To tackle this problem, previous studies introduce some assumptions on user behavior to make the combinatorial item space tractable. However, an unrealistic assumption may, in turn, cause serious bias. Therefore, appropriately controlling the bias-variance tradeoff by imposing a reasonable assumption is the key for success in OPE of ranking policies. To achieve a well-balanced bias-variance tradeoff, we propose the Cascade Doubly Robust estimator building on the cascade assumption, which assumes that a user interacts with items sequentially from the top position in a ranking. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased in more cases compared to existing estimators that make stronger assumptions. Furthermore, compared to a previous estimator based on the same cascade assumption, the proposed estimator reduces the variance by leveraging a control variate.

Relevance ranking aims at building a ranked list sorted in decreasing order of item relevance, while result diversification focuses on generating a ranked list of items that covers a broad range of topics. In this paper, we study an online learning setting that aims to recommend a ranked list with $K$ items that maximizes the ranking utility, i.e., a list whose items are relevant and whose topics are diverse. We formulate it as the cascade hybrid bandits (CHB) problem. CHB assumes the cascading user behavior, where a user browses the displayed list from top to bottom, clicks the first attractive item, and stops browsing the rest. We propose a hybrid contextual bandit approach, called CascadeHybrid, for solving this problem. CascadeHybrid models item relevance and topical diversity using two independent functions and simultaneously learns those functions from user click feedback. We conduct experiments to evaluate CascadeHybrid on two real-world recommendation datasets: MovieLens and Yahoo music datasets.

Cascade architecture, composed of retrieval, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, is usually adopted to reduce the computational cost. Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and calculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs.

Although OPE in contextual bandits has been studied extensively, its naive application to the ranking setting faces a critical variance issue due to the huge item space. To tackle this problem, previous studies introduce some assumptions on user behavior to make the combinatorial item space tractable. However, an unrealistic assumption may, in turn, cause serious bias. Therefore, appropriately controlling the bias-variance tradeoff by imposing a reasonable assumption is the key for success in OPE of ranking policies. To achieve a well-balanced bias-variance tradeoff, we propose the Cascade Doubly Robust estimator building on the cascade assumption, which assumes that a user interacts with items sequentially from the top position in a ranking. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased in more cases compared to existing estimators that make stronger assumptions.

Technical obstacles include the need for robust metrics to evaluate ranking consistency and the development of algorithms that can effectively align the outputs of different stages without incurring significant computational costs.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on individual stages of the ranking process, neglecting the interactions and dependencies between them.

For instance, in image classification, translating an\nimage by a few pixels (Azulay & Weiss, 2019) or modifying\nthe background spurious correlations. We hypothesize\nthat because of this, on CMNIST and CelebA (Table 1),\nwhere concepts are less spatially separable, our method\u2019s\nbenefit is a bit limited compared to other datasets like Water-\nbirds, Urban Cars, Bar (Nam et al., 2020) (Table 6), whereconcepts have clear spatial regions. Further investigation in\nthis direction is needed. In principle, one could try to learn a\ndisentangled representation of the high level objects and use\nthe disentangled factors of variations as concept. Work like\nSingh et al. (2022) that further factorizes the representation\nof each semantic region can be used to mitigate this issue by\nallowing one spatial region to be represented as a collection\nof concepts.\n4.2.7. A VOIDING REPRESENTATION COLLAPSE\nOur concept discovery method is based on self-supervised\nSiamese representation learning, utilizing two parallel en-\ncoders: the student produces the source slot encoding and\nthe teacher produces the target encoding. One of the main\nissues with this kind of encoder-only learning framework is\nrepresentation collapse (Hua et al., 2021). During training,\nour method can obtain a degenerate solution in which all\nrepresentations of the slots fall into one cluster, while still\nminimizing the objective in Equation 5.\nTo avoid this degenerate case, we employ a similar set of\nideas as DINO (Caron et al., 2021) to have asymmetric\nteacher and student branches: 1) using data augmentations\nof teacher and student views; 2) centering and sharpening\nof teacher slot distributions; 3) updating teacher weights by\ntaking an exponential moving average of student. Typically,\nthe teacher model\u2019s weights are updated after every gradient\nupdate step for most datasets. However, for the CMNIST\ndatasets, data augmentation is not used. To maintain the\nasymmetry between the teacher and student models in the\nabsence of data augmentation, the updates for the CMNIST\ndatasets are performed less frequently, specifically after\nevery 20 steps.\n5. related work in Section 2). Our approach models concepts\nthat do not necessarily correspond directly to subgroups;\ntypically, we use a significantly larger number of concepts\nthan annotated subgroups in the dataset.\nThis paper demonstrates the use of object-centric represen-\ntation learning approaches to design classifiers robust to\nspurious correlations without the need for human-labeled\nsubgroup annotations. We introduce CoBalT, a method\ncombining concept discovery with concept balancing for\nrobust classification. CoBalT follows a two-stage procedure\ncommon in the literature: first, inferring information about\nthe training data, and then leveraging this information for\nrobust training.\nInStage 1 , we propose to vector quantize semantic group-\n1arXiv:2402.13368v2  [cs.LG]  16 Jul 2024Unsupervised Concept Discovery Mitigates Spurious Correlations\ning representations into discrete concepts (Section 3.2), en-\nabling the association of each input with relevant sets of\nconcepts (see Fig 1) and facilitating the calculation of con-\ncept occurrence statistics across the dataset.\nInStage 2 , we utilize the occurrence statistics of concepts\nvia importance sampling to train a separate classifier (Sec-\ntion 3.3).

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability necessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the limitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) strategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog and digital methods. Addressing this need, this paper introduces a novel hybrid DeepJSCC framework, h-DJSCC, tailored for effective image transmission from edge devices through a network architecture that includes initial wireless transmission followed by multiple wired hops. Our approach harnesses the strengths of DeepJSCC for the initial, variable-quality wireless link to avoid the cliff effect inherent in purely digital schemes. For the subsequent wired hops, which feature more stable and high-capacity connections, we implement digital compression and forwarding techniques to prevent noise accumulation. This dual-mode strategy is adaptable even in scenarios with limited knowledge of the image distribution, enhancing the framework's robustness and utility. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our hybrid solution outperforms traditional fully digital approaches by effectively managing transitions between different network segments and optimizing for variable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The average network performance depends on the choice of the modulation index, the number of frequency-hopping channels, and the fractional in-band power, which are assumed to be fixed network parameters. The performance of a given transmission depends on the code rate, which is adapted in response to the interference to meet a constraint on outage probability. The optimization proceeds by choosing a set of fixed network parameters, drawing the interferers from the spatial distribution, and determining the maximum rate that satisfies the outage constraint.

However, the existing work on DL based JSCC usually trains the designed network to operate under a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, without taking into account that the SNR level during the deployment stage may differ from that during the training stage. A number of networks are required to cover the scenario with a broad range of SNRs, which is computational inefficiency (in the training stage) and requires large storage. To overcome these drawbacks our paper proposes a novel method called Attention DL based JSCC (ADJSCC) that can successfully operate with different SNR levels during transmission. This design is inspired by the resource assignment strategy in traditional JSCC, which dynamically adjusts the compression ratio in source coding and the channel coding rate according to the channel SNR. This is achieved by resorting to attention mechanisms because these are able to allocate computing resources to more critical tasks. Instead of applying the resource allocation strategy in traditional JSCC, the ADJSCC uses the channel-wise soft attention to scaling features according to SNR conditions. We compare the ADJSCC method with the state-of-the-art DL based JSCC method through extensive experiments to demonstrate its adaptability, robustness and versatility.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Although LLMs have shown great capacity to perform human-like task accomplishment in natural language and natural image, their potential in handling remote sensing interpretation tasks has not yet been fully explored. Moreover, the lack of automation in remote sensing task planning hinders the accessibility of remote sensing interpretation techniques, especially to non-remote sensing experts from multiple research fields. To this end, we present Remote Sensing ChatGPT, an LLM-powered agent that utilizes ChatGPT to connect various AI-based remote sensing models to solve complicated interpretation tasks. More specifically, given a user request and a remote sensing image, we utilized ChatGPT to understand user requests, perform task planning according to the tasks' functions, execute each subtask iteratively, and generate the final response according to the output of each subtask. Considering that LLM is trained with natural language and is not capable of directly perceiving visual concepts as contained in remote sensing images, we designed visual cues that inject visual information into ChatGPT. With Remote Sensing ChatGPT, users can simply send a remote sensing image with the corresponding request, and get the interpretation results as well as language feedback from Remote Sensing ChatGPT. Experiments and examples show that Remote Sensing ChatGPT can tackle a wide range of remote sensing tasks and can be extended to more tasks with more sophisticated models such as the remote sensing foundation model.

However, these models are constrained to basic vision and language instruction-tuning tasks, facing challenges in complex remote sensing applications. Additionally, these models lack specialized expertise in professional domains. To address these limitations, we propose a LLM-driven remote sensing intelligent agent named RS-Agent. Firstly, RS-Agent is powered by a large language model (LLM) that acts as its \\\"Central Controller,\\\" enabling it to understand and respond to various problems intelligently. Secondly, our RS-Agent integrates many high-performance remote sensing image processing tools, facilitating multi-tool and multi-turn conversations. Thirdly, our RS-Agent can answer professional questions by leveraging robust knowledge documents. We conducted experiments using several datasets, e.g., RSSDIVCS, RSVQA, and DOTAv1.

However, existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information. Additionally, the SFI module is repeatedly integrated into the layers of the large language model (LLM) to achieve deep visual language feature alignment, without compromising the model's performance in natural language processing tasks. These innovations, capturing detailed visual effects through higher resolution and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve the model's ability to learn from image text data. We validate the effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its superior performance.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06074v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731130316, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"bb1c3ed4-b53e-4c43-9598-285d771c3de4\", \"authors\": [\"Xiang Li\", \"Jian Ding\", \"Mohamed Elhoseiny\"], \"title\": \"VRSBench: A Versatile Vision-Language Benchmark Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Understanding\", \"abstract\": \"We introduce a new benchmark designed to advance the development of general-purpose, large-scale vision-language models for remote sensing images.

Exploring these improvement opportunities, we present a Versatile vision-language Benchmark for Remote Sensing image understanding, termed VRSBench.

In this paper, we investigate to describe the remote sensing images with accurate and flexible sentences. First, some annotated instructions are presented to better describe the remote sensing images considering the special characteristics of remote sensing images. Second, in order to exhaustively exploit the contents of remote sensing images, a large-scale aerial image data set is constructed for remote sensing image caption.

We demonstrate that the PLMs are well-calibrated on the masked language modeling task with robust predictive confidence under domain shift, yet the fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream classification task. In light of these observations, we evaluate the calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned language models.

To this end, we present Remote Sensing ChatGPT, an LLM-powered agent that utilizes ChatGPT to connect various AI-based remote sensing models to solve complicated interpretation tasks.

Tweets are often informal, unstructured and lacking labeled data such as categories and ratings, making it challenging for product opinion mining. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based opinion model named Twitter Opinion Topic Model (TOTM) for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. TOTM leverages hashtags, mentions, emoticons and strong sentiment words that are present in tweets in its discovery process.

Studying sentiment and subjectivity in these opinion videos is experiencing a growing attention from academia and industry. While sentiment analysis has been successful for text, it is an understudied research question for videos and multimedia content. The biggest setbacks for studies in this direction are lack of a proper dataset, methodology, baselines and statistical analysis of how information from different modality sources relate to each other. This paper introduces to the scientific community the first opinion-level annotated corpus of sentiment and subjectivity analysis in online videos called Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity dataset (MOSI). The dataset is rigorously annotated with labels for subjectivity, sentiment intensity, per-frame and per-opinion annotated visual features, and per-milliseconds annotated audio features.

In this work we aim at bridging the gap separating fine grained opinion models already developed for written language and coarse grained models developed for spontaneous multimodal opinion mining.

To validate this method, we use as ground truth the opinions expressed in U.S. nationally representative surveys on COVID-19 and consumer confidence. Our studies indicate that this approach is (1) predictive of human judgements found in survey response distributions and robust to phrasing and channels of media exposure, (2) more accurate at modeling people who follow media more closely, and (3) aligned with literature on which types of opinions are affected by media consumption.

By improving the selection of training datasets, we can enhance the performance of LLMs in specialized tasks, making them more accessible and effective for practitioners in various domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response. This research could lead to more efficient training processes, reduced computational costs, and better model performance, ultimately influencing future research directions in both remote sensing and AI.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the vast amount of available data, which can be noisy and unstructured, making it difficult to identify high-quality datasets that are relevant for specific tasks. Naive approaches, such as random sampling, may lead to suboptimal performance due to the inclusion of irrelevant or low-quality data. Additionally, the complexity of remote sensing tasks requires a nuanced understanding of both the data and the model's capabilities, necessitating sophisticated methods for dataset selection and evaluation.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on direct training with large datasets without adequately addressing the quality of the data used for fine-tuning. Existing solutions may lack the necessary algorithms to filter and categorize datasets effectively, leading to inefficiencies and performance degradation. Our approach aims to fill this gap by introducing a novel adaptive fine-tuning algorithm that leverages clustering and generalization performance metrics to select high-quality datasets, thus improving upon prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves projecting large-scale datasets into a semantic vector space and using the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm for automated clustering. We will evaluate the generalization performance of each dataset cluster by introducing perturbations and measuring the resulting changes in the model's vector space. The expected outcomes include a more efficient training process, with a significant reduction in training time and computational resources while maintaining or improving model performance in remote sensing tasks. We will validate our approach using the RS multimodal instruction-following dataset and benchmark it against existing methods to demonstrate its effectiveness.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures.

Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph.

From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

However, they currently lack the ability to teach themselves new skills, relying instead on large amounts of human-generated training data. We introduce SECToR (Self-Education via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning), a proof-of-concept demonstration that language models can teach themselves new skills using chain-of-thought reasoning. During the self-learning loop, SECToR asks models to solve addition problems using chain-of-thought reasoning before training the next version of the model to solve those same problems directly without using such reasoning. This process often results in an improved model which can, when again augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning, solve even harder problems than the original model, allowing the self-learning loop to continue. Language models trained via SECToR autonomously learn to add up to the longest-length-digit numbers without access to any ground truth examples beyond an initial supervised fine-tuning phase consisting only of numbers with 6 or fewer digits. Our central hypothesis is that chain-of-thought reasoning can act as a policy improvement operator, similarly to how Monte-Carlo Tree Search is used in AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017).

It could lead to the development of neural networks that exhibit more human-like understanding and reasoning capabilities, bridging the gap between cognitive science and machine learning. This research could influence future studies on cognitive development, enhance AI's ability to generalize from limited data, and improve applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of translating non-linguistic observations into structured, compositional representations akin to language. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent differences between linguistic and non-linguistic data, such as the lack of explicit structure in images. Additionally, technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated models that can capture hierarchical relationships and compositionality, as well as the difficulty in evaluating the quality of learned representations in a meaningful way.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on linguistic data, neglecting the potential of non-linguistic inputs for learning structured representations.

(2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al.

Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead.

A control policy is learned using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the FEM-based simulation environment and transferred to real-world situation. Grasping points are planned in the simulator by utilizing the trained policy using Bayesian optimization (BO). Inconsistent simulation performance is overcome by formulating the problem as a state augmented Markov decision process (MDP).

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been introduced to the planning processes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy for prostate, lung, and cervical cancers. However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create auxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs), along with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver cancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to other treatment sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRL-based automatic treatment planning model capable of achieving human-level performance for H&N cancers.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11576v1\", \"timestamp\": 1726610516, \"domain\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"461f9adc-709b-4292-87d4-ccf645e90433\", \"authors\": [\"Yunhao Yang\", \"William Ward\", \"Zichao Hu\", \"Joydeep Biswas\", \"Ufuk Topcu\"], \"title\": \"Joint Verification and Refinement of Language Models for Safety-Constrained Planning\", \"abstract\": \"Although pre-trained language models can generate executable plans (e.g., programmatic policies) for solving robot tasks, the generated plans may violate task-relevant logical specifications due to the models' black-box nature.

We develop a method to generate executable plans and formally verify them against task-relevant safety specifications. Given a high-level task description in natural language, the proposed method queries a language model to generate plans in the form of executable robot programs. It then converts the generated plan into an automaton-based representation, allowing formal verification of the automaton against the specifications. We prove that given a set of verified plans, the composition of these plans also satisfies the safety specifications. This proof ensures the safety of complex, multi-component plans, obviating the computation complexity of verifying the composed plan.

We build data-driven models of human trust dynamics and takeover decisions, which are incorporated in the POMDP framework, using data collected from an online user study with 100 participants on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We compute optimal routes for automated vehicles by solving optimal policies in the POMDP planning, and evaluate the resulting routes via human subject experiments with 22 participants on a driving simulator. The experimental results show that participants taking the trust-based route generally reported more positive responses in the after-driving survey than those taking the baseline (trust-free) route.

For this, we exploit the relation established between the expressive power of GNNs and the $C_{2}$ fragment of first-order logic (namely, FOL with 2 variables and counting quantifiers). We find for example that domains with general policies that require more expressive features can be solved with GNNs once the states are extended with suitable \\\"derived atoms\\\" encoding role compositions and transitive closures that do not fit into $C_{2}$. The work follows the GNN approach for learning optimal general policies in a supervised fashion (Stahlberg, Bonet, Geffner, 2022); but the learned policies are no longer required to be optimal (which expands the scope, as many planning domains do not have general optimal policies) and are learned without supervision. Interestingly, value-based reinforcement learning methods that aim to produce optimal policies, do not always yield policies that generalize, as the goals of optimality and generality are in conflict in domains where optimal planning is NP-hard.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06002v1\", \"timestamp\": 1652351326, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a4ce5a61-2f4b-4212-bc6b-730c5571d8dc\", \"authors\": [\"Dominik Drexler\", \"Simon St\\u00e5hlberg\", \"Blai Bonet\", \"Hector Geffner\"], \"title\": \"Symmetries and Expressive Requirements for Learning General Policies\", \"abstract\": \"State symmetries play an important role in planning and generalized planning.

The standard approach to handling existentially quantified goals in classical planning involves compiling them into a DNF formula that encodes all possible variable bindings and adding dummy actions to map each DNF term into the new, dummy goal. This preprocessing is exponential in the number of variables. In generalized planning, the problem is different: even if general policies can deal with any initial situation and goal, executing a general policy requires the goal to be grounded to define a value for the policy features. The problem of grounding goals, namely finding the objects to bind the goal variables, is subtle: it is a generalization of classical planning, which is a special case when there are no goal variables to bind, and constraint reasoning, which is a special case when there are no actions. In this work, we address the goal grounding problem with a novel supervised learning approach. A GNN architecture, trained to predict the cost of partially quantified goals over small domain instances is tested on larger instances involving more objects and different quantified goals. The proposed architecture is evaluated experimentally over several planning domains where generalization is tested along several dimensions including the number of goal variables and objects that can bind such variables.

Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job creation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its transformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can adopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering the causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way, entrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and analysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies causal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative innovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the entrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious gap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the entrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity, proactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour influence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we analysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities in southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation methodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results show, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship learning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in the field of entrepreneurial intentions. Considering propensity towards causal behaviour before setting up the firm is unprecedented. Furthermore, the results of this study have practical implications for the design of public education policies and the promotion of business creation in the tourism sector.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00517v1\", \"timestamp\": 1701431182, \"domain\": \"econ.GN\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6a795e3d-325c-483b-801d-d66d5322f310\", \"authors\": [\"Xuan Liu\", \"Jie Fu\"], \"title\": \"Compositional planning in Markov decision processes: Temporal abstraction meets generalized logic composition\", \"abstract\": \"In hierarchical planning for Markov decision processes (MDPs), temporal abstraction allows planning with macro-actions that take place at different time scale in form of sequential composition.

However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&N cancers.

These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans.

To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

While the experimental results underline the complementary nature of APE and QE, we also observe that QE-APE multitask learning facilitates effective domain adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the multilingual APE models outperform their corresponding English-Hindi and English-Marathi single-pair models by $2.5$ and $2.39$ TER points, respectively, with further notable improvements over the multilingual APE model observed through multi-task learning ($+1.29$ and $+1.44$ TER points), data augmentation ($+0.53$ and $+0.45$ TER points) and domain adaptation ($+0.35$ and $+0.45$ TER points).

This research could lead to more inclusive AI systems that better serve global populations, fostering advancements in natural language processing, translation, and cross-lingual understanding. Such improvements could also facilitate better communication and information access for speakers of low-resource languages, ultimately contributing to the preservation of linguistic diversity.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing multilingual capabilities stem from the complexity of code-switching, where speakers alternate between languages within a conversation. Existing models often struggle with this due to their training primarily on monolingual datasets, leading to inadequate representation of mixed-language contexts. Additionally, the lack of sufficient data for low-resource languages poses a significant barrier, as naive approaches may not capture the nuances of these languages or the interactions between them effectively. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can integrate language-specific features while maintaining a unified model.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has largely focused on monolingual or bilingual models, neglecting the intricacies of code-switching and the needs of low-resource languages. The limited availability of high-quality training data for these languages has hindered progress. Additionally, many existing models do not leverage the potential of multilingual training effectively, often resulting in suboptimal performance in mixed-language scenarios. Our approach aims to address these gaps by employing meta-learning techniques to create adaptable models that can learn both language-agnostic and language-specific features, thus improving performance in code-switching tasks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a meta-learning framework that generates dynamic parameters for language-specific feature extraction in multilingual models. We will utilize a diverse dataset that includes code-switching examples and low-resource language data to train our model. Metrics for evaluation will include accuracy in code-switching tasks, translation quality, and performance on low-resource language benchmarks.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\nModels Drop rate AlpacaEval GSM8K MBPP Average\nLM +\nMath0.1 0.805 0.599 / 0.702\n0.3 0.812 0.629 / 0.721\n0.5 0.804 0.645 / 0.724\n0.7 0.787 0.611 / 0.699\n0.9 0.683 0.455 / 0.570\nLM +\nCode0.1 0.741 / 0 0.370\n0.3 0.770 / 0 0.385\n0.5 0.802 / 0.152 0.477\n0.7 0.798 / 0.34 0.569\n0.9 0.737 / 0.262 0.500\nMath +\nCode0.1 / 0.619 0.166 0.393\n0.3 / 0.618 0.184 0.401\n0.5 / 0.626 0.206 0.416\n0.7 / 0.633 0.19 0.412\n0.9 / 0.622 0.128 0.375\nLM +\nMath +\nCode0.1 0.732 0.545 0.114 0.464\n0.3 0.766 0.623 0.302 0.564\n0.5 0.794 0.630 0.3 0.575\n0.7 0.770 0.622 0.23 0.541\n0.9 0.688 0.446 0.128 0.421\nTable 7: Drop Rate of parameters against Task perfor-\nmance Appendix\nA.1 Importance of GPT4-as-a-judge for Math\ntasks - Example\nQuestion: Each person in a certain\nhousehold consumes 0.2 kg of rice ev-\nery meal.

By improving model merging techniques, we can reduce memory usage and enhance the ability to share knowledge across tasks, leading to better performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. This research could pave the way for more versatile and scalable AI systems, influencing future research directions in model optimization and deployment.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing the reduction of parameter interference with the retention of essential information during the merging process. Naive approaches may lead to significant performance degradation due to the loss of critical delta parameters. Additionally, the complexity of determining optimal drop rates and the interactions between different model parameters complicate the merging process. Technical obstacles include developing robust pruning methods that can accurately assess the importance of delta parameters without compromising model integrity.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on individual model fine-tuning rather than effective merging strategies. Limitations in understanding the interactions between homologous models and the lack of sophisticated pruning techniques have hindered progress. Existing solutions often fail to address the nuanced trade-offs between parameter reduction and performance retention. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing a systematic method for delta parameter selection and merging that leverages magnitude sampling and sign-based selection.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves three key steps: (1) implementing MAGPRUNE, a novel pruning method that samples delta parameters based on their magnitudes to minimize interference; (2) applying sign-based delta parameter selection to further refine the merging process; and (3) fusing the selected delta parameters into a cohesive model. We will evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets (AlpacaEval, GSM8K, MBPP) and compare performance metrics against existing methods (DARE).

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47].

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

Table 5 presents the sensitivity of parameter \u03b1on the Pubmed dataset.\nIt is observed that a relatively larger value of \u03b1, such as 10 or 50, leads to a significant improvement\nin performance. This finding further emphasizes the effectiveness of our proposed regularization Related Work\nLatent Graph Inference. Given only the node features of data, latent graph inference (LGI) aims to\nsimultaneously learn the underlying graph structure and discriminative node representations from the\nfeatures of data [10, 24, 39]. For example, Jiang et al. [15] propose to infer the graph structure by\ncombining graph learning and graph convolution in a unified framework. Yang et al. [45] model the\ntopology refinement as a label propagation process. Jin et al. [16] explore some intrinsic properties of\nthe latent graph and propose a robust LGI framework to defend adversarial attacks on graphs.

Substantial researchers have focused on defining neighbors for aggregation, predominantly based on observed adjacency matrices.

Therefore, many researchers have turned their attention to latent graph inference, specifically learning a parametric graph. To mitigate fluctuations in latent graph structure learning, this paper proposes a novel Boolean product-based graph residual connection in GNNs to link the latent graph and the original graph. It computes the Boolean product between the latent graph and the original graph at each layer to correct the learning process. The Boolean product between two adjacency matrices is equivalent to triangle detection. Accordingly, the proposed Boolean product graph neural networks can be interpreted as discovering triangular cliques from the original and the latent graph.

These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework, a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability techniques that track the gradient contributions of different latent graphs, shedding light on how our attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns to choose the appropriate latent space. In line with previous works, our experiments emphasize the advantages of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing performance. More importantly, our interpretability framework provides a general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces across different tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked in previous literature on latent graph inference.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11891v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700497463, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"5f9531a4-1905-4605-9d45-e7271cd0de72\", \"authors\": [\"Haitz S\\u00e1ez de Oc\\u00e1riz Borde\", \"Anastasis Kratsios\"], \"title\": \"Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries\", \"abstract\": \"The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003v1\", \"timestamp\": 1698073046, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively infer latent graph structures from incomplete or noisy data in graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance their performance in various applications?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the limitations of current GNNs that rely on predefined graph structures, which may not always be available or accurate. By developing methods for latent graph inference (LGI), we can improve the adaptability and robustness of GNNs in real-world scenarios, such as social network analysis, biological data interpretation, and recommendation systems. This research could lead to significant advancements in machine learning, enabling more effective data representation and analysis, and fostering innovations in various fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of accurately inferring graph structures from incomplete or noisy data, which can lead to misrepresentations and degraded model performance. Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of the data and the intricate relationships between nodes that are not easily captured without a clear graph structure. Additionally, the need for robust algorithms that can dynamically adapt to varying data conditions and effectively learn from limited supervision adds to the difficulty.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on static graph structures, often overlooking the dynamic nature of real-world data. Existing LGI methods may lack theoretical foundations or fail to generalize across different types of data. Barriers include the absence of differentiable methods for optimal embedding space selection and the challenge of integrating complex geometric representations into GNNs. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing novel frameworks that leverage advanced mathematical concepts, such as Riemannian geometry and trainable latent geometries, to enhance LGI.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a differentiable framework for latent graph inference that incorporates Riemannian geometry to model complex embedding spaces. We will utilize benchmark datasets, such as Pubmed and S&P 500 stock price data, to evaluate our approach. Key metrics for performance assessment will include accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Most GCN-based methods consist of a graph filter or followed by a low-rank mapping optimized based on supervised training. However, we show two limitations suppressing the power of graph filtering: (1) Lack of generality. Due to the varied noise distribution, graph filters fail to denoise sparse data where noise is scattered across all frequencies, while supervised training results in worse performance on dense data where noise is concentrated in middle frequencies that can be removed by graph filters without training. (2) Lack of expressive power. We theoretically show that linear GCN (LGCN) that is effective on collaborative filtering (CF) cannot generate arbitrary embeddings, implying the possibility that optimal data representation might be unreachable.   To tackle the first limitation, we show close relation between noise distribution and the sharpness of spectrum where a sharper spectral distribution is more desirable causing data noise to be separable from important features without training. Based on this observation, we propose a generalized graph normalization G^2N to adjust the sharpness of spectral distribution in order to redistribute data noise to assure that it can be removed by graph filtering without training. As for the second limitation, we propose an individualized graph filter (IGF) adapting to the different confidence levels of the user preference that interactions can reflect, which is proved to be able to generate arbitrary embeddings. By simplifying LGCN, we further propose a simplified graph filtering (SGFCF) which only requires the top-K singular values for recommendation.

One classical approach in GCF is to learn user and item embeddings with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and utilize these embeddings for CF models.

This is because they fail to model complex node dependencies and variable relation dependencies from a given graph, making the learned embeddings fragile to uncover the root causes of user interests. In this work, we propose to integrate causal modeling with the learning process of GCN-based GCF models, leveraging causality-aware graph embeddings to capture complex causal relations in recommendations. We complete the task by 1) Causal Graph conceptualization, 2) Neural Causal Model parameterization and 3) Variational inference for Neural Causal Model.

Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function.

Most GCN-based methods consist of a graph filter or followed by a low-rank mapping optimized based on supervised training. However, we show two limitations suppressing the power of graph filtering: (1) Lack of generality. Due to the varied noise distribution, graph filters fail to denoise sparse data where noise is scattered across all frequencies, while supervised training results in worse performance on dense data where noise is concentrated in middle frequencies that can be removed by graph filters without training. (2) Lack of expressive power. We theoretically show that linear GCN (LGCN) that is effective on collaborative filtering (CF) cannot generate arbitrary embeddings, implying the possibility that optimal data representation might be unreachable.   To tackle the first limitation, we show close relation between noise distribution and the sharpness of spectrum where a sharper spectral distribution is more desirable causing data noise to be separable from important features without training. Based on this observation, we propose a generalized graph normalization G^2N to adjust the sharpness of spectral distribution in order to redistribute data noise to assure that it can be removed by graph filtering without training. As for the second limitation, we propose an individualized graph filter (IGF) adapting to the different confidence levels of the user preference that interactions can reflect, which is proved to be able to generate arbitrary embeddings. By simplifying LGCN, we further propose a simplified graph filtering (SGFCF) which only requires the top-K singular values for recommendation.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13168v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700630675, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6a22a7ba-af27-4e05-bd02-c1b35e9beb5b\", \"authors\": [\"Zijiang Yang\", \"Zhongwei Qiu\", \"Chang Xu\", \"Dongmei Fu\"], \"title\": \"MM-NeRF: Multimodal-Guided 3D Multi-Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Field\", \"abstract\": \"3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization.

To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer. The experimental results show that our method not only renders 4D photorealistic style transfer results in a zero-shot manner but also outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08310v1\", \"timestamp\": 1710315741, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively perform 3D style transfer using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) while ensuring high-quality, multi-view consistency and allowing users to test stylization ideas before fine-tuning?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of 3D graphics and content creation, as it would enable creators to easily stylize 3D scenes without requiring extensive technical skills or tools. This research could lead to more intuitive design processes, enhancing creativity and productivity in industries such as gaming, film, and virtual reality. Furthermore, it could pave the way for future research into more generalized and efficient methods of 3D content generation and manipulation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in this area stem from the need to maintain visual consistency across multiple views while applying diverse artistic styles. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent complexity of 3D representations and the potential for artifacts when transferring styles. Additionally, existing methods often require extensive per-scene optimization, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. Overcoming these technical hurdles, such as ensuring high-quality rendering and managing the computational load, is essential for a successful solution.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on 2D style transfer or has struggled with the limitations of existing NeRF-based methods, which often lead to inconsistencies in stylization across different views. The lack of effective multimodal guidance and the need for scene-specific optimization have hindered progress. Our approach aims to address these gaps by leveraging a generalized NeRF model that can handle multiple styles without extensive retraining, thus improving efficiency and applicability.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves training a NeRF model on stylized images generated by a depth-conditioned diffusion model, guided by a Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss to ensure high-quality style transfer. We will utilize a diverse dataset of 3D scenes and corresponding stylized images to evaluate our approach. Key metrics will include visual quality, multi-view consistency, and user satisfaction in testing stylization ideas. The expected outcome is a robust framework that allows for effective 3D style transfer while enabling users to experiment with different styles before finalizing their designs.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 78803, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 5, "agent3": 5, "agent4": 5}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.   Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020 Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning, Diagnosis and Detection leading to the extraction of 168 articles that ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Using deep models to realize automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection.

In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have shown impressive performance in myriad image recognition tasks. However, they usually require a large number of annotated data for training. Inspired by Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), a common finding in COIVD-19 patient's CT scans, we proposed in this paper a novel self-supervised pretraining method based on pseudo lesions generation and restoration for COVID-19 diagnosis. We used Perlin noise, a gradient noise based mathematical model, to generate lesion-like patterns, which were then randomly pasted to the lung regions of normal CT images to generate pseudo COVID-19 images. The pairs of normal and pseudo COVID-19 images were then used to train an encoder-decoder architecture based U-Net for image restoration, which does not require any labelled data. The pretrained encoder was then fine-tuned using labelled data for COVID-19 diagnosis task. Two public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images were employed for evaluation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed self-supervised learning approach could extract better feature representation for COVID-19 diagnosis and the accuracy of the proposed method outperformed the supervised model pretrained on large scale images by 6.57% and 3.03% on SARS-CoV-2 dataset and Jinan COVID-19 dataset, respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12313v1\", \"timestamp\": 1624447290, \"domain\": \"eess.IV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"51df9f7e-fcaf-4248-91b4-840da158b0da\", \"authors\": [\"Yujin Oh\", \"Sangjoon Park\", \"Jong Chul Ye\"], \"title\": \"Deep Learning COVID-19 Features on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets\", \"abstract\": \"Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important.

Concerning the novelty of the disease, the diagnostic methods based on radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.   Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020 Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning, Diagnosis and Detection leading to the extraction of 168 articles that ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: This review study provides an overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19 through radiology modalities and their processing based on deep learning. According to the finding, Deep learning Based models have an extraordinary capacity to achieve an accurate and efficient system for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, which using of them in the processing of CT-Scan and X-Ray images, would lead to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values.

Using deep models to realize automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection.

Enhanced diagnostic methods can lead to faster patient triage, reduced healthcare costs, and better resource allocation. This research could pave the way for future studies on automated diagnostic systems, potentially influencing the development of similar approaches for other infectious diseases.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges include the scarcity of labeled training data due to the emergent nature of the pandemic, which complicates the training of deep learning models. Naive approaches may fail because they often rely on large datasets for effective learning, which are not available in this context. Additionally, the variability in imaging quality and the need for high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis add to the complexity of developing robust models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on traditional diagnostic methods or has been limited by the availability of comprehensive datasets. Many existing solutions do not adequately address the need for real-time, automated analysis of radiological images. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning techniques to generate pseudo lesions, allowing for effective training on limited data, which differs from prior work that typically requires extensive labeled datasets.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a self-supervised learning framework that generates pseudo COVID-19 lesions using Perlin noise and applies an encoder-decoder architecture for image restoration.

This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample, recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1). Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n\u00a9 S. Hanneke, S. Moran & T.

Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1.

We investigate classical principles related to generalization within the context of list learning. Our primary goal is to determine whether classical principles in the PAC setting retain their applicability in the domain of list PAC learning. We focus on uniform convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam's Razor). In classical PAC learning, both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of `completeness': whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres to these principles. We ask whether the same completeness holds true in the list learning setting.   We show that uniform convergence remains equivalent to learnability in the list PAC learning setting. In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\\\\{0,1,2\\\\}$, then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986). We prove an even stronger impossibility result, showing that there are $2$-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed even when the reconstructed function can work with lists of arbitrarily large size.

Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation learning, recent advance on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of multimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia recommendation.   In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a small (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease the recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia recommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can lead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial learning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia recommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product recommendation.

Theoretical obstacles include proving the equivalence of uniform convergence and learnability in this new context, as well as addressing the limitations of sample compression in list learning scenarios, which have shown to be more restrictive than in classical settings.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on classical PAC learning without systematically exploring how its principles apply to list learning. The lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for list PAC learning has created barriers to understanding its foundational principles. Additionally, existing studies have not adequately addressed the unique challenges posed by list outputs, such as the need for multiple correct labels and the implications of label ambiguity. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by rigorously analyzing the applicability of classical principles in the context of list learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a theoretical analysis of list PAC learning, focusing on the concepts of uniform convergence and sample compression. We will utilize mathematical proofs to establish the relationships between these concepts and their implications for learnability in list settings. The dataset will consist of various benchmark problems that require list outputs, and we will evaluate our findings using metrics such as generalization error and sample complexity. The expected outcome is a clearer understanding of the principles governing list PAC learning, which could lead to the development of new algorithms that leverage these insights for improved performance in practical applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 51928, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 5, "agent3": 5}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

To address the problem, we propose HRGCN, an unsupervised deep heterogeneous graph neural network, to model complex heterogeneous relations between different entities in the system for effectively identifying these anomalous behaviour graphs. HRGCN trains a hierarchical relation-augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HetGNN), which learns better graph representations by modelling the interactions among all the system entities and considering both source-to-destination entity (node) types and their relation (edge) types.

Recently, it has been studied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and edges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between nodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to community detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes' embedding to facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose to exploit the context path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes, and build a Context Path-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN) model. It recursively embeds the high-order relationship between nodes into the node embedding with attention mechanisms to discriminate the importance of different relationships. By maximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context paths, the model can learn the nodes' embeddings that both well preserve the high-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection.

By advancing the modeling of multi-table RDBs, we can unlock new insights and improve predictive accuracy in various applications, such as business intelligence, healthcare, and social network analysis. This research could lead to the establishment of new benchmarks and methodologies, influencing future studies and practical implementations in data science.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the inherent structure of RDBs, which involves multiple interrelated tables and the need to capture relational information effectively. Naive approaches that flatten data into single tables often lose critical relational context, leading to suboptimal model performance. Additionally, the lack of established benchmarks for RDBs complicates the evaluation of different modeling approaches, making it difficult to determine the best practices for leveraging relational data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-table data due to the challenges of accessing and processing multi-table RDBs, often hindered by privacy concerns and restrictive data access policies. Existing solutions tend to rely on surrogate benchmarks that do not accurately reflect the complexities of RDBs.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             introduction of\nan algorithm for malware detection and classification based on\ntransformers [8]. The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information. The proposed approach\nachieves not only enhanced accuracy in identifying malicious\npayloads, but also pushes the boundaries of current methodolo-\ngies that help distinguish malicious payload types by employing\ntwo different classification heads.\nII. D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines.

For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload.

By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format.

However, their sensitivity to adversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given rise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware example Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware variants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box methods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most malware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating non-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice due to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal language model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to malware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte sequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). Our proposed method, MalGPT, significantly outperformed the leading benchmark methods on a real-world malware dataset obtained from VirusTotal, achieving over 24.51\\\\% evasion rate.

It remains a critical task to achieve effective malware traffic detection. In this paper, we introduce CBSeq to address the above problems. CBSeq is a method that constructs a stable traffic representation, behavior sequence, to characterize attacking intent and achieve malware traffic detection. We novelly propose the channels with similar behavior as the detection object and extract side-channel content to construct behavior sequence. Unlike benign activities, the behavior sequences of malware and its variant's traffic exhibit solid internal correlations. Moreover, we design the MSFormer, a powerful Transformer-based multi-sequence fusion classifier. It captures the internal similarity of behavior sequence, thereby distinguishing malware traffic from benign traffic.

Our proposed model is also able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class malware classification of types and family with macro-F1 score of .497 and .491 respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07049v1\", \"timestamp\": 1660549798, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"46bd1bff-5856-4632-ba38-153ea9ef9992\", \"authors\": [\"James Lee Hu\", \"Mohammadreza Ebrahimi\", \"Hsinchun Chen\"], \"title\": \"Single-Shot Black-Box Adversarial Attacks Against Malware Detectors: A Causal Language Model Approach\", \"abstract\": \"Deep Learning (DL)-based malware detectors are increasingly adopted for early detection of malicious behavior in cybersecurity. However, their sensitivity to adversarial malware variants has raised immense security concerns. Generating such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them. This necessity has given rise to an emerging stream of machine learning research, Adversarial Malware example Generation (AMG), which aims to generate evasive adversarial malware variants that preserve the malicious functionality of a given malware. Within AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box methods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples. Given that most malware detectors enforce a query limit, this could result in generating non-realistic adversarial examples that are likely to be detected in practice due to lack of stealth. In this study, we show that a novel DL-based causal language model enables single-shot evasion (i.e., with only one query to malware detector) by treating the content of the malware executable as a byte sequence and training a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). Our proposed method, MalGPT, significantly outperformed the leading benchmark methods on a real-world malware dataset obtained from VirusTotal, achieving over 24.51\\\\% evasion rate. MalGPT enables cybersecurity researchers to develop advanced defense capabilities by emulating large-scale realistic AMG.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01724v1\", \"timestamp\": 1638509390, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"fdef39f4-61fe-4108-963f-17b7e3e2e550\", \"authors\": [\"Susu Cui\", \"Cong Dong\", \"Meng Shen\", \"Yuling Liu\", \"Bo Jiang\", \"Zhigang Lu\"], \"title\": \"CBSeq: A Channel-level Behavior Sequence For Encrypted Malware Traffic Detection\", \"abstract\": \"Machine learning and neural networks have become increasingly popular solutions for encrypted malware traffic detection. They mine and learn complex traffic patterns, enabling detection by fitting boundaries between malware traffic and benign traffic. Compared with signature-based methods, they have higher scalability and flexibility. However, affected by the frequent variants and updates of malware, current methods suffer from a high false positive rate and do not work well for unknown malware traffic detection. It remains a critical task to achieve effective malware traffic detection. In this paper, we introduce CBSeq to address the above problems. CBSeq is a method that constructs a stable traffic representation, behavior sequence, to characterize attacking intent and achieve malware traffic detection. We novelly propose the channels with similar behavior as the detection object and extract side-channel content to construct behavior sequence. Unlike benign activities, the behavior sequences of malware and its variant's traffic exhibit solid internal correlations. Moreover, we design the MSFormer, a powerful Transformer-based multi-sequence fusion classifier. It captures the internal similarity of behavior sequence, thereby distinguishing malware traffic from benign traffic. Our evaluations demonstrate that CBSeq performs effectively in various known malware traffic detection and exhibits superior performance in unknown malware traffic detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09002v1\", \"timestamp\": 1689662300, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we enhance malware detection and classification in network traffic using transformer-based models that effectively generalize to unseen attack types with minimal labeled data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as cyber threats continue to evolve, becoming more sophisticated and difficult to detect with traditional methods. By improving malware detection through advanced machine learning techniques, we can significantly enhance network security, leading to better protection against emerging threats. This research could pave the way for future studies on self-supervised and few-shot learning approaches in cybersecurity, potentially leading to practical applications in real-time threat detection and response systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to accurately identify and classify novel malware types that have not been previously encountered, which requires models to generalize well from limited labeled data. Naive approaches may fail due to the high variability in malware behavior and the constant evolution of attack strategies. Additionally, the challenge of balancing the dataset to avoid bias towards benign or malicious samples complicates the training process, necessitating sophisticated techniques to ensure robust performance across diverse scenarios.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often relied on supervised learning methods that require extensive labeled datasets, which are not always available, especially for new malware types. Additionally, many existing solutions struggle with generalization to unseen attacks due to their reliance on specific features or signatures. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning and few-shot learning, which allows for better adaptation to new threats by learning from unlabeled data and minimal examples, thus addressing the limitations of prior methodologies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using a transformer-based model trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets, specifically focusing on payload data from network traffic. We will utilize the UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IoT23 datasets for evaluation, employing metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to assess performance.
