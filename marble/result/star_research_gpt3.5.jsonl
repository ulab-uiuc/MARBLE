This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

Transfer learning has enabled large deep learning neural networks trained on the language modeling task to vastly improve performance in almost all downstream language tasks. Interestingly, when the language models are trained with data that includes software code, they demonstrate remarkable abilities in generating functioning computer code from natural language specifications. We argue that this creates a conundrum for the claim that eliminative neural models are a radical restructuring in our understanding of cognition in that they eliminate the need for symbolic abstractions like generative phrase structure grammars. Because the syntax of programming languages is by design determined by phrase structure grammars, neural models that produce syntactic code are apparently uninformative about the theoretical foundations of programming languages. The demonstration that neural models perform well on tasks that involve clearly symbolic systems, proves that they cannot be used as an argument that language and other cognitive systems are not symbolic.

This effort necessitates two key foundations: a platform capable of generating data to facilitate the training and testing of V2X-AD, and a comprehensive system that integrates full driving-related functionalities with mechanisms for information sharing.

The core idea is a novel driving-oriented communication strategy. Leveraging this strategy, CoDriving improves driving performance while optimizing communication efficiency. We make comprehensive benchmarks with V2Xverse, analyzing both modular performance and closed-loop driving performance. Experimental results show that CoDriving: i) significantly improves the driving score by 62.49% and drastically reduces the pedestrian collision rate by 53.50% compared to the SOTA end-to-end driving method, and ii) achieves sustaining driving performance superiority over dynamic constraint communication conditions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09496v1\", \"timestamp\": 1713162812, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"641fc631-334f-4e61-a798-073c7fca41b9\", \"authors\": [\"Akshay Gopalkrishnan\", \"Ross Greer\", \"Mohan Trivedi\"], \"title\": \"Multi-Frame, Lightweight & Efficient Vision-Language Models for Question Answering in Autonomous Driving\", \"abstract\": \"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-Modal Language models (MMLMs) have become prominent in autonomous driving research, as these models can provide interpretable textual reasoning and responses for end-to-end autonomous driving safety tasks using traffic scene images and other data modalities.

Instead of removing these redundant channels for efficiency consideration, we aim to reactivate them to enlarge the representation capacity of GNNs for effective graph learning. In this paper, we propose to substitute these redundant channels with other informative channels to achieve this goal. We introduce a novel GNN learning framework named AKE-GNN, which performs the Adaptive Knowledge Exchange strategy among multiple graph views generated by graph augmentations. AKE-GNN first trains multiple GNNs each corresponding to one graph view to obtain informative channels. Then, AKE-GNN iteratively exchanges redundant channels in the weight parameter matrix of one GNN with informative channels of another GNN in a layer-wise manner. Additionally, existing GNNs can be seamlessly incorporated into our framework. AKE-GNN achieves superior performance compared with various baselines across a suite of experiments on node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. In particular, we conduct a series of experiments on 15 public benchmark datasets, 8 popular GNN models, and 3 graph tasks and show that AKE-GNN consistently outperforms existing popular GNN models and even their ensembles.

Previous studies have primarily attempted to utilize the information from higher-order neighbors in the graph, involving the incorporation of powers of the shift operator, such as the graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix. This approach comes with a trade-off in terms of increased computational and memory demands. Relying on graph spectral theory, we make a fundamental observation: the regular and the Hadamard power of the Laplacian matrix behave similarly in the spectrum. This observation has significant implications for capturing higher-order information in GNNs for various tasks such as node classification and semi-supervised learning. Consequently, we propose a novel graph convolutional operator based on the sparse Sobolev norm of graph signals. Our approach, known as Sparse Sobolev GNN (S2-GNN), employs Hadamard products between matrices to maintain the sparsity level in graph representations. S2-GNN utilizes a cascade of filters with increasing Hadamard powers to generate a diverse set of functions. We theoretically analyze the stability of S2-GNN to show the robustness of the model against possible graph perturbations.

Overcoming these complexities requires innovative solutions that balance model complexity, performance, and interpretability.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by the design of existing GNN architectures, which may overlook low-order feature interactions or struggle with vanishing gradients in multi-relational graphs. The development of novel GNN methods like Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), Explicit Feature Interaction-aware Graph Neural Networks (EFI-GNN), and improved Gated Graph Neural Network architectures has opened up new possibilities for addressing these challenges.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing advanced GNN architectures like ID-GNN, EFI-GNN, and improved Gated Graph Neural Networks to enhance expressive power, handle feature interactions, and improve long-range performance. The approach includes conducting experiments on various datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new GNN models in achieving state-of-the-art results in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks.

This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data.

To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks.

Such a representation works nicely with\nalgebraic manipulations. Here we introduce a sim-\nple method to augment an attributed graph with a\nvirtual node that is bidirectionally connected to all\nexisting nodes. The virtual node represents the la-\ntent aspects of the graph, which are not immediately\navailable from the attributes and local connectivity\nstructures. The expanded graph is then put through\nany node representation method. The representation\nof the virtual node is then the representation of the\nentire graph. In this paper, we use the recently in-\ntroduced Column Network for the expanded graph,\nresulting in a new end-to-end graph classi\ufb01cation\nmodel dubbed Virtual Column Network (VCN). The\nmodel is validated on two tasks: (i) predicting bio-\nactivity of chemical compounds, and (ii) \ufb01nding\nsoftware vulnerability from source code.Results\nFig. 3 reports the performance on Code classi\ufb01cation task in\nAUC and F1-score. VCN outperforms all the baselines on\nboth measures.\n4results in a new graph classi\ufb01cation method called\nVirtual Column Network (VCN). We demonstrate the power\nof the VCN on two tasks: (i) classi\ufb01cation of bio-activity of\nchemical compounds against a given cancer; (ii) detecting soft-\nware vulnerability from source code. Overall, the automatic\nrepresentation learning is more powerful than state-of-the art\nfeature engineering.\nThere are rooms open for further investigations.

Regarding graph classification tasks, the graphs to be classified may have various graph sizes (i.e., different number of nodes and edges) and have various graph properties (e.g., average node degree, diameter, and clustering coefficient). The diverse property of graphs has imposed significant challenges on existing graph learning techniques since diverse graphs have different best-fit hyperparameters. It is difficult to learn graph features from a set of diverse graphs by a unified graph neural network. This motivates us to use a multiplex structure in a diverse way and utilize a priori properties of graphs to guide the learning. In this paper, we propose MxPool, which concurrently uses multiple graph convolution/pooling networks to build a hierarchical learning structure for graph representation learning tasks. Our experiments on numerous graph classification benchmarks show that our MxPool has superiority over other state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06846v1\", \"timestamp\": 1586912729, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"52040026-9d65-427d-863c-508cf420b7f4\", \"authors\": [\"Rongrong Ma\", \"Guansong Pang\", \"Ling Chen\"], \"title\": \"Imbalanced Graph Classification with Multi-scale Oversampling Graph Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"One main challenge in imbalanced graph classification is to learn expressive representations of the graphs in under-represented (minority) classes. Existing generic imbalanced learning methods, such as oversampling and imbalanced learning loss functions, can be adopted for enabling graph representation learning models to cope with this challenge. However, these methods often directly operate on the graph representations, ignoring rich discriminative information within the graphs and their interactions. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel multi-scale oversampling graph neural network (MOSGNN) that learns expressive minority graph representations based on intra- and inter-graph semantics resulting from oversampled graphs at multiple scales - subgraph, graph, and pairwise graphs. It achieves this by jointly optimizing subgraph-level, graph-level, and pairwise-graph learning tasks to learn the discriminative information embedded within and between the minority graphs. Extensive experiments on 16 imbalanced graph datasets show that MOSGNN i) significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art models, and ii) offers a generic framework, in which different advanced imbalanced learning loss functions can be easily plugged in and obtain significantly improved classification performance.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04903v2\", \"timestamp\": 1715159814, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e9f94c10-f28f-401e-b0cb-d4567fb7af88\", \"authors\": [\"Mingyu Zhao\", \"Xingyu Huang\", \"Ziyu Lyu\", \"Yanlin Wang\", \"Lixin Cui\", \"Lu Bai\"], \"title\": \"Knowledge Probing for Graph Representation Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Graph learning methods have been extensively applied in diverse application areas. However, what kind of inherent graph properties e.g. graph proximity, graph structural information has been encoded into graph representation learning for downstream tasks is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel graph probing framework (GraphProbe) to investigate and interpret whether the family of graph learning methods has encoded different levels of knowledge in graph representation learning. Based on the intrinsic properties of graphs, we design three probes to systematically investigate the graph representation learning process from different perspectives, respectively the node-wise level, the path-wise level, and the structural level. We construct a thorough evaluation benchmark with nine representative graph learning methods from random walk based approaches, basic graph neural networks and self-supervised graph methods, and probe them on six benchmark datasets for node classification, link prediction and graph classification. The experimental evaluation verify that GraphProbe can estimate the capability of graph representation learning. Remaking results have been concluded: GCN and WeightedGCN methods are relatively versatile methods achieving better results with respect to different tasks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03877v1\", \"timestamp\": 1723048065, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b32a9e58-dfb7-4670-8027-b1a42e6489f7\", \"authors\": [\"Haishuai Wang\"], \"title\": \"Time-Variant Graph Classification\", \"abstract\": \"Graphs are commonly used to represent objects, such as images and text, for pattern classification. In a dynamic world, an object may continuously evolve over time, and so does the graph extracted from the underlying object. These changes in graph structure with respect to the temporal order present a new representation of the graph, in which an object corresponds to a set of time-variant graphs. In this paper, we formulate a novel time-variant graph classification task and propose a new graph feature, called a graph-shapelet pattern, for learning and classifying time-variant graphs. Graph-shapelet patterns are compact and discriminative graph transformation subsequences. A graph-shapelet pattern can be regarded as a graphical extension of a shapelet -- a class of discriminative features designed for vector-based temporal data classification. To discover graph-shapelet patterns, we propose to convert a time-variant graph sequence into time-series data and use the discovered shapelets to find graph transformation subsequences as graph-shapelet patterns. By converting each graph-shapelet pattern into a unique tokenized graph transformation sequence, we can measure the similarity between two graph-shapelet patterns and therefore classify time-variant graphs.

However, current HGPNNs do not take full advantage of the graph's intrinsic structures (e.g., community structure). Moreover, the pooling operations in existing HGPNNs are difficult to be interpreted. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable graph pooling framework - CommPOOL, that can capture and preserve the hierarchical community structure of graphs in the graph representation learning process. Specifically, the proposed community pooling mechanism in CommPOOL utilizes an unsupervised approach for capturing the inherent community structure of graphs in an interpretable manner. CommPOOL is a general and flexible framework for hierarchical graph representation learning that can further facilitate various graph-level tasks. Evaluations on five public benchmark datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of CommPOOL in graph representation learning for graph classification compared to the state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its effectiveness in capturing and preserving the community structure of graphs.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05980v1\", \"timestamp\": 1607634858, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:Based on your expertise in transportation systems and advanced modeling techniques, as well as your recent work on Kriformer and the analysis of traveler behavior and bus corridor dynamics, you can collaborate with the research team to generate a new research idea.

This can significantly impact future research by providing a new framework for hierarchical graph representation learning, advancing knowledge in the field of machine learning, and improving classification performance.\n\n[Question 3] - Why is it hard?\n\nThe diverse properties of graphs pose significant challenges for existing graph learning techniques, as different graphs require different hyperparameters. This complexity makes it difficult to learn graph features uniformly, and naive approaches may fail due to the varied nature of graphs. Overcoming these challenges requires a sophisticated understanding of graph structures and properties.\n\n[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\n\nPrevious research has not fully explored the potential of utilizing a multiplex structure and priori properties of graphs to guide the learning process. Existing methods often operate directly on graph representations, overlooking rich discriminative information within graphs and their interactions. By introducing a novel multi-scale oversampling graph neural network, we aim to address this limitation and improve classification performance.\n\n[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the development of a multi-scale oversampling graph neural network (MOSGNN) that learns expressive minority graph representations based on intra- and inter-graph semantics. We plan to use subgraph-level, graph-level, and pairwise-graph learning tasks to optimize the discriminative information within and between minority graphs.

Addressing these challenges can lead to more efficient algorithms and methodologies, ultimately impacting future research by improving the accuracy and reliability of numerical analysis techniques. This work could also have practical applications in various industries where numerical analysis is utilized.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of unbounded and infeasible problems in numerical analysis presents challenges in finding optimal solutions. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the intricate nature of these problems, requiring sophisticated algorithms and techniques to overcome technical and theoretical obstacles. The need to handle diverging iterates and identify indicators of unboundedness adds to the difficulty of solving such problems.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research may have limitations in addressing unbounded and infeasible problems effectively, leading to gaps in existing solutions. Barriers such as the need for advanced embedding techniques and penalizing weights to handle unboundedness and infeasibility may have prevented the complete resolution of these issues. This approach differs by proposing a method that leverages embedding and penalizing weights to address unbounded and infeasible problems more effectively.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves utilizing embedding techniques and penalizing weights to handle unbounded and infeasible problems in numerical analysis. The method aims to converge in a finite number of steps and identify optimal solutions even in challenging scenarios.

This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the image may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce a deep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark Anything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\\\\times 256$ images.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350998, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d761a81f-681e-4e81-a451-9e4847396d89\", \"authors\": [\"Harsh Rangwani\"], \"title\": \"Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data\", \"abstract\": \"The datasets used for Deep Neural Network training (e.g., ImageNet, MSCOCO, etc.) are often manually balanced across categories (classes) to facilitate learning of all the categories. This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"434dd3c5-979c-4f60-882a-bb9847d8d856\", \"authors\": [\"Zecheng Zhang\", \"Christian Moya\", \"Lu Lu\", \"Guang Lin\", \"Hayden Schaeffer\"], \"title\": \"DeepONet as a Multi-Operator Extrapolation Model: Distributed Pretraining with Physics-Informed Fine-Tuning\", \"abstract\": \"We propose a novel fine-tuning method to achieve multi-operator learning through training a distributed neural operator with diverse function data and then zero-shot fine-tuning the neural network using physics-informed losses for downstream tasks.

See full examples at[1, 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure\u00a01 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo leads the LLM to perform the task. The complete conversations are available at [1, 2].\n\n\nTo validate and assess Crescendo\u2019s effectiveness, we evaluate it against current state-of-the-art LLMs, ranging from open-source models like LLaMA-2 70b and LLaMA-3 70b to closed-source ones such as Gemini-Pro, Claude-2, Claude-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we start by manually executing Crescendo on a subset of the tasks listed in Table\u00a01 against all models. Our findings confirm that Crescendo can indeed overcome the safety alignment of all models for nearly all tasks (Table\u00a02).\nMoreover, we show that once a multimodal model, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is jailbroken using Crescendo, it can be used for different modality tasks, such as generating images that\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content.

Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks.

For example, adversaries may aim to deceive spam filters and recommendation systems trained with federated learning for monetary gain. The adversarial clients have extensive information about the victim model in a federated learning setting, as weight information is shared amongst clients. We are the first to characterize the transferability of such internal evasion attacks for different learning methods and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness depending on the degree of similarities in client data.

As machine learning, federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning.

However, the distributed data silos limit the performance of GNN. Vertical federated learning (VFL), an emerging technique to process distributed data, successfully makes GNN possible to handle the distributed graph-structured data. Despite the prosperous development of vertical federated graph learning (VFGL), the robustness of VFGL against the adversarial attack has not been explored yet. Although numerous adversarial attacks against centralized GNNs are proposed, their attack performance is challenged in the VFGL scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the adversarial attack against VFGL. A query-efficient hybrid adversarial attack framework is proposed to significantly improve the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, denoted as NA2, short for Neuron-based Adversarial Attack. Specifically, a malicious client manipulates its local training data to improve its contribution in a stealthy fashion. Then a shadow model is established based on the manipulated data to simulate the behavior of the server model in VFGL. As a result, the shadow model can improve the attack success rate of various centralized attacks with a few queries. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks demonstrate that NA2 improves the performance of the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, achieving state-of-the-art performance even under potential adaptive defense where the defender knows the attack method. Additionally, we provide interpretable experiments of the effectiveness of NA2 via sensitive neurons identification and visualization of t-SNE.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02809v1\", \"timestamp\": 1730782340, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e9b67b7e-dfab-4ced-9d69-3b09edea05a0\", \"authors\": [\"Yi Li\", \"Plamen Angelov\", \"Zhengxin Yu\", \"Alvaro Lopez Pellicer\", \"Neeraj Suri\"], \"title\": \"Federated Adversarial Learning for Robust Autonomous Landing Runway Detection\", \"abstract\": \"As the development of deep learning techniques in autonomous landing systems continues to grow, one of the major challenges is trust and security in the face of possible adversarial attacks.

Firstly, the local model is pre-trained on a large-scale lane detection dataset. Then, instead of exploiting large instance-adaptive models, we resort to a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method known as scale and shift deep features (SSF), upon the pre-trained model. Secondly, in each SSF layer, distributions of clean local data and its adversarial version are disentangled for accurate statistics estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first instance of federated learning work that address the adversarial sample problem in landing runway detection.

The training data for these models is usually collected from the Internet (e.g., from open-source repositories) and is likely to contain faults and security vulnerabilities. This unsanitized training data can cause the language models to learn these vulnerabilities and propagate them during the code generation procedure.

Foliations and connected components generated by point-shifts are studied, and the cardinality classification of connected components, previously known on Euclidean space, is generalized to unimodular groups. An explicit counterexample is also given on a non-unimodular group. Isomodularity of a point-shift is defined and identified as a key component in generalizations of Mecke's invariance theorem in the unimodular and non-unimodular cases. Isomodularity is also the deciding factor of when the reciprocal and reverse of a point-map corresponding to a bijective point-shift are equal in distribution.

We introduce fundamental information-theoretic concepts and quantities for point processes and present general lower and upper bounds on the rate-distortion function. To enable a comparison with the vector setting, we concretize our bounds for point processes of fixed cardinality. In particular, we analyze a fixed number of unordered Gaussian data points and show that we can significantly reduce the required rates compared to the best possible compression strategy for Gaussian vectors. As an example of point processes with variable cardinality, we study the best possible compression of Poisson point processes. For the specific case of a Poisson point process with uniform intensity on the unit square, our lower and upper bounds are separated by only a small gap and thus provide a good characterization of the rate-distortion function.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05758v2\", \"timestamp\": 1492613559, \"domain\": \"cs.IT\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"04bfc243-6685-4549-bf3d-b907925e8faf\", \"authors\": [\"Gert Nieuwenhuis\"], \"title\": \"Asymptotic mean stationarity and absolute continuity of point process distributions\", \"abstract\": \"This paper relates - for point processes $\\\\Phi$ on $\\\\mathbb{R}$ - two types of asymptotic mean stationarity (AMS) properties and several absolute continuity results for the common probability measures emerging from point process theory.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation.

It can advance the field by streamlining data preparation and improving the performance of downstream models. Addressing this question could lead to advancements in automated feature transformation techniques and enhance the overall quality of machine learning applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in developing automated feature transformation methods that can consistently generate informative and robust features across different datasets and machine learning tasks. Naive approaches may struggle to capture the complexity of feature interactions and may not generalize well to diverse datasets. Technical obstacles include optimizing the transformation process to balance feature importance and stability.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on iterative approaches to feature transformation, but limitations such as stochasticity, lack of stability, and the inability to learn strategies from transformation steps have hindered optimal solutions. Barriers include the complexity of identifying high-value sub-transformations and historical information from the data, as well as the need to balance feature importance scores effectively. Our approach aims to address these limitations by leveraging graph-based models and historical sub-transformations to generate more significant features.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves leveraging historical information from the data graph to identify optimal substructures and transform crucial nodes effectively. We plan to use a combination of expansion-reduction and iterative-feedback approaches to refine the feature space, incorporating reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. The datasets used for evaluation will include the Housing Boston and Wine Quality White datasets, with metrics such as 1-RAE and F1-score to assess performance.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the \ufb01eld of LLMs.\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Ho\ufb00mann et al.,\n2022) rede\ufb01ned those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights.

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that $M_\\\\bullet \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies.

Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives.

GNNs have shown to be\neffective in addressing a variety of real-world applications such as\nfraud detection [ 18,47,74], recommendation systems [ 61,71,72],\npredicting molecular and protein structure [ 29,57], knowledge\n1Accepted in KDD\u201923. DOI: 10.1145/3580305.3599843representation [ 15], and more recently helping in fine-tuning large\nlanguage models [ 73]. Their popularity has led to the development\nof various optimized frameworks and libraries [ 19,63,76] that\nenable the fast application of GNNs on new domains, making it\neasier for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of\nGNNs in their work.\nHowever, high-quality frameworks and libraries are necessary\nbut not sufficient for enabling fast research progress in GNN. One\nof the major challenges in GNN research is the lack of large-scale\ndatasets. This is because large graph datasets are typically propriety\nand most publicly available ones are rather small. The small size\nof these datasets makes it difficult to train GNNs that can handle\nlarge-graph structures and prevents the use of powerful pre-training\ntechniques [ 16,32,59,65]. These challenges make it difficult to fully\nleverage GNN potential and its applications.\nTo address these challenges, recent work such as OGBN and\nMAG [ 26,27] have proposed open large graph benchmark suites\nproviding up to 244 million nodes and 1.7 billion edge graphs. These\ndatasets contain a diverse set of graphs and have been widely used\nin the research community to benchmark GNNs\u2019 performance. How-\never, most existing datasets, including OGBN, provide very limited\nlabeled data. As GNN downstream tasks are often trained as super-\nvised learning tasks, having large labeled data matters, especially\nfor multi-label classification problems. However, both OGBN and\nMAG use Arxiv [ 26,27] class labels which provide 1.4 million la-\nbeled nodes, meaning only about 1% of the overall dataset is labeled!\nWith such small labeled data usage during training, it becomes chal-\nlenging to determine if the GNN model\u2019s low accuracy for unseen\ndata is inherently due to insufficient training data or if the model\nitself fails to generalize [28, 37, 45, 62, 78].\nFurthermore, the lack of flexible datasets hinders the researcher\u2019s\nability to scrutinize and systematically evaluate the scalability of\nthe GNN models, frameworks, and systems.

To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification.

Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph neural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small graphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks instead.

This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary.

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot.

However, most research works either focus on providing an end-to-end solution training the whole system using Deep Reinforcement Learning or focus on one specific aspect such as local motion planning. This however, comes along with a number of problems such as catastrophic forgetfulness, inefficient navigation behavior, and non-optimal synchronization between different entities of the navigation stack. In this paper, we propose a holistic Deep Reinforcement Learning training approach in which the training procedure is involving all entities of the navigation stack. This should enhance the synchronization between- and understanding of all entities of the navigation stack and as a result, improve navigational performance. We trained several agents with a number of different observation spaces to study the impact of different input on the navigation behavior of the agent.

The goal of this thesis is to make progress towards designing algorithms capable of `physical intelligence', i.e. building intelligent autonomous navigation agents capable of learning to perform complex navigation tasks in the physical world involving visual perception, natural language understanding, reasoning, planning, and sequential decision making. Despite several advances in classical navigation methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception, language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization, mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13415v1\", \"timestamp\": 1624594258, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a6a6d5fc-8f17-414f-a07f-ccfa4b73d056\", \"authors\": [\"L.

In this work, we explore their application to end-to-end navigation -- including both perception and planning -- by considering the problem of jointly performing global localization and path planning in known but arbitrary 2D environments. In particular, we introduce a diffusion model which produces collision-free paths in a global reference frame given an egocentric LIDAR scan, an arbitrary map, and a desired goal position. To this end, we implement diffusion in the space of paths in SE(2), and describe how to condition the denoising process on both obstacles and sensor observations. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed conditioning techniques enable generalization to realistic maps of considerably different appearance than the training environment, demonstrate our model's ability to accurately describe ambiguous solutions, and run extensive simulation experiments showcasing our model's use as a real-time, end-to-end localization and planning stack.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17995v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727366840, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": false, \"error-msg\": \"Paper not found.\"}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nWhat are the key components of my approach and results?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nExplain the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community.\nDiscuss how such a paper will affect future research.\nDiscuss how addressing this question could advance knowledge or lead to practical applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDiscuss the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem.\nExplain why naive or straightforward approaches may fail.\nIdentify any technical, theoretical, or practical obstacles that need to be overcome.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, access to molecular forces has become an essential aspect in various applications such as geometry optimization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\u00a0(Jensen, 2010).\nHowever, the underlying quantum mechanical (QM) calculations required for these predictions are computationally demanding.\nIn order to reduce this computational burden, graph neural networks (GNNs) fitted to QM data have been proposed as a means to accelerate MD simulations\u00a0(Chmiela et\u00a0al., 2017; Sch\u00fctt et\u00a0al., 2018).\nWhile such surrogates have recently achieved exceptional reproduction of the dataset they have been trained on, they tend to perform poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) data (Li et\u00a0al., 2022). In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

Using this representation we show that: (1) a \\\"sweet spot\\\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.

To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification.

Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph neural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small graphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks instead.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

In this article, we propose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect anomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic features into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency modeling.

The goal of unsupervised-ADS is to detect unknown anomalous sound without training data of anomalous sound. Use of an AE as a normal model is a state-of-the-art technique for unsupervised-ADS. To decrease the false positive rate (FPR), the AE is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of normal sounds and the anomaly score is calculated as the reconstruction error of the observed sound. Unfortunately, since this training procedure does not take into account the anomaly score for anomalous sounds, the true positive rate (TPR) does not necessarily increase. In this study, we define an objective function based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma by considering ADS as a statistical hypothesis test. The proposed objective function trains the AE to maximize the TPR under an arbitrary low FPR condition. To calculate the TPR in the objective function, we consider that the set of anomalous sounds is the complementary set of normal sounds and simulate anomalous sounds by using a rejection sampling algorithm.

In our proposed method, each client calculates embeddings using a common pre-trained model developed for sound data classification, and these calculated embeddings are aggregated on the server to perform anomalous sound detection through outlier exposure.

However, these anomalous sounds of machines are usually unavailable in normal conditions. Therefore, the models employed have to learn acoustic representations with normal sounds for training, and detect anomalous sounds while testing. In this article, we propose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect anomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic features into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency modeling. DPT blocks use attention modules to alternately model the interactive information about the frequency and temporal components of the segmented acoustic features. To address the problem of lack of anomalous sound, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach to train the network with normal sound. Specifically, this approach randomly masks and reconstructs the acoustic features, and jointly classifies machine identity information to improve the performance of anomalous sound detection. We evaluated our method on the DCASE2021 task2 dataset. The experimental results show that the SSDPT network achieves a significant increase in the harmonic mean AUC score, in comparison to present state-of-the-art methods of anomalous sound detection.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03421v1\", \"timestamp\": 1659752236, \"domain\": \"eess.AS\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b1190a70-08af-4bb2-97ad-a3726ecd7953\", \"authors\": [\"Yuma Koizumi\", \"Shoichiro Saito\", \"Hisashi Uematsum Yuta Kawachi\", \"Noboru Harada\"], \"title\": \"Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sound based on Deep Learning and the Neyman-Pearson Lemma\", \"abstract\": \"This paper proposes a novel optimization principle and its implementation for unsupervised anomaly detection in sound (ADS) using an autoencoder (AE). The goal of unsupervised-ADS is to detect unknown anomalous sound without training data of anomalous sound. Use of an AE as a normal model is a state-of-the-art technique for unsupervised-ADS. To decrease the false positive rate (FPR), the AE is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of normal sounds and the anomaly score is calculated as the reconstruction error of the observed sound. Unfortunately, since this training procedure does not take into account the anomaly score for anomalous sounds, the true positive rate (TPR) does not necessarily increase. In this study, we define an objective function based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma by considering ADS as a statistical hypothesis test. The proposed objective function trains the AE to maximize the TPR under an arbitrary low FPR condition. To calculate the TPR in the objective function, we consider that the set of anomalous sounds is the complementary set of normal sounds and simulate anomalous sounds by using a rejection sampling algorithm. Through experiments using synthetic data, we found that the proposed method improved the performance measures of ADS under low FPR conditions. In addition, we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real environments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09133v1\", \"timestamp\": 1540196459, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nWhat are the current methods and challenges in unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD) using autoencoders (AE) for non-stationary sound signals?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving the challenges in unsupervised ASD using AE for non-stationary sound signals can lead to improved anomaly detection in various applications, such as industrial machinery monitoring, road surveillance, and animal disease detection. Addressing this problem can advance knowledge in the field of anomaly detection and lead to practical applications in reducing machine damage and manual inspection costs.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in unsupervised ASD using AE for non-stationary sound signals include the difficulty in distinguishing normal and anomalous sounds due to differences in sound distributions, the limitations of conventional AE-based methods for non-stationary ASD, and the lack of anomalous sound data for training supervised models. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of sound signal distributions and the need to consider non-stationary normal sounds.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has limitations in addressing the differences in sound distributions for normal and anomalous sounds, the lack of anomalous sound data for training, and the challenges in reconstructing non-stationary sound signals accurately. The proposed approaches in the literature review aim to improve anomaly detection performance by considering sound separation, timbre differences, machine identity, and self-supervised learning, which differ from prior work and offer potential improvements.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves utilizing sound separation, timbre difference capturing, machine identity, and self-supervised learning to enhance unsupervised ASD using AE for non-stationary sound signals.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024).

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors.

This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\nto analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n\u2022 Unlike most prior studies that have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n\u2022 Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand the impact of ageing across the gender.\n\u2022 As opposed to the previous studies that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\nThe ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4. Methodology\nWe use the linear mixed effect (LME) [24] models to analyze\nthe variation in the ASV score with respect to the age differ-\nence under different gender, language, and session conditions.\nWe fit the following model to ASV score data under different\nconditions:\nSi=\u00b5+\u03b2\u2217\u03b4i+\u03b3 (1)\nwhere Siis ASV score of i-th trial, \u00b5is intercept or mean of the\nASV scores in a particular condition, \u03b4iis the age difference\nbetween enrollment and verification audio, \u03b2is fixed effect co-\nefficient that establishes a linear relationship between age dif-\nference ( \u03b4i) and ASV score Si, and\u03b3is a random effect which is\ninduced by other variabilities such as Results and Discussions\n5.1.

However, a voice conversion system could manipulate a person's speech signal to make it sound like another speaker's voice and deceive the speaker verification system. Most countermeasures for voice conversion-based spoofing attacks are designed to discriminate bona fide speech from spoofed speech for speaker verification systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of source speaker identification -- inferring the identity of the source speaker given the voice converted speech. To perform source speaker identification, we simply add voice-converted speech data with the label of source speaker identity to the genuine speech dataset during speaker embedding network training. Experimental results show the feasibility of source speaker identification when training and testing with converted speeches from the same voice conversion model(s). In addition, our results demonstrate that having more converted utterances from various voice conversion model for training helps improve the source speaker identification performance on converted utterances from unseen voice conversion models.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09103v2\", \"timestamp\": 1655523934, \"domain\": \"eess.AS\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a6fefe4f-09ee-45a0-bbee-16f3af933718\", \"authors\": [\"Deja Kamil\", \"Sanchez Ariadna\", \"Roth Julian\", \"Cotescu Marius\"], \"title\": \"Automatic Evaluation of Speaker Similarity\", \"abstract\": \"We introduce a new automatic evaluation method for speaker similarity assessment, that is consistent with human perceptual scores.

Multi-speaker models bring new possibilities, such as a faster creation of new voices, but also a new problem - speaker leakage, where the speaker identity of a synthesized example might not match those of the target speaker. Currently, the only way to discover this issue is through costly perceptual evaluations. In this work, we propose an automatic method for assessment of speaker similarity. For that purpose, we extend the recent work on speaker verification systems and evaluate how different metrics and speaker embeddings models reflect Multiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) scores.

Speaker verification is done by the use of some parameters (features) from the speakers voice which can be used to differentiate among many speakers.

There are many methods used for speaker verification. Some systems use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features (MFCCs), while others use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based speaker recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM), GMMs . In this paper simple intra-pitch temporal information in conjunction with pitch synchronous cepstral coefficients forms the feature set. The distinct feature of a speaker is determined from the steady state part of five cardinal spoken English vowels. The performance was found to be average when these features were used independently. But very encouraging results were observed when both features were combined to form a decision for speaker verification.

Advanced speaker verification systems, which leverage deep-learning approaches to extract speaker representations, have been successfully applied to a range of native speaker verification tasks.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions.

Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere. Aurora can produce forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric forecasting problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events.

Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere.

In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation models to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include Prithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an important question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for different remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance the understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for pixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution, through comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size deep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios traditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to foundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for classification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising results for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar), while the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning models is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability of foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised learning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked autoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing problems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11797v1\", \"timestamp\": 1713396648, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"65c8d298-12c6-4c13-8cbe-4ae79b52bfb7\", \"authors\": [\"Kaiyu Li\", \"Xiangyong Cao\", \"Deyu Meng\"], \"title\": \"A New Learning Paradigm for Foundation Model-based Remote Sensing Change Detection\", \"abstract\": \"Change detection (CD) is a critical task to observe and analyze dynamic processes of land cover.

In this paper, we propose a Bi-Temporal Adapter Network (BAN), which is a universal foundation model-based CD adaptation framework aiming to extract the knowledge of foundation models for CD. The proposed BAN contains three parts, i.e. frozen foundation model (e.g., CLIP), bi-temporal adapter branch (Bi-TAB), and bridging modules between them. Specifically, BAN extracts general features through a frozen foundation model, which are then selected, aligned, and injected into Bi-TAB via the bridging modules. Bi-TAB is designed as a model-agnostic concept to extract task/domain-specific features, which can be either an existing arbitrary CD model or some hand-crafted stacked blocks. Beyond current customized models, BAN is the first extensive attempt to adapt the foundation model to the CD task. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our BAN in improving the performance of existing CD methods (e.g., up to 4.08\\\\% IoU improvement) with only a few additional learnable parameters.

Initial testing demon-\nstrates the feasibility of this approach.\n1Background\nAutonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) is concerned with\nthe defence of computer systems and networks through au-\ntonomous decision-making and action. It is particularly\nneeded where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\nversary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop arti\ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\nrobotics, ACO is affected by the \u2018reality gap\u2019 [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021 ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could be critical to an agent\u2019s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\nwhich is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment, precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the \u2018reality gap\u2019, used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\nin a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated systems.

Autonomous cyber defenses therefore become essential to mitigate the risk of successful attacks and their damage, especially when the response time, effort and accuracy required in those defenses is impractical or impossible through defenses operated exclusively by humans. Autonomous agents have the potential to use ML with large amounts of data about known cyberattacks as input, in order to learn patterns and predict characteristics of future attacks. Moreover, learning from past and present attacks enable defenses to adapt to new threats that share characteristics with previous attacks. On the other hand, autonomous cyber defenses introduce risks of unintended harm. Actions arising from autonomous defense agents may have harmful consequences of functional, safety, security, ethical, or moral nature.

These agents, operating on critical network infrastructure, need to be robust and trustworthy to ensure defense against adaptive cyber-attackers and, simultaneously, provide explanations for their actions and network activity. However, learning-enabled components typically use models, such as deep neural networks, that are not transparent in their high-level decision-making leading to assurance challenges. Additionally, cyber-defense agents must execute complex long-term defense tasks in a reactive manner that involve coordination of multiple interdependent subtasks. Behavior trees are known to be successful in modelling interpretable, reactive, and modular agent policies with learning-enabled components. In this paper, we develop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior trees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber environment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The learning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks and deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a simulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and enhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture for evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve.

Addressing this issue can significantly impact future research by enhancing the capabilities of AI-driven machines and expanding the applications of neural networks to handle diverse data sources effectively.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of processing unstructured data like images using traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) due to the large number of parameters involved.

Although multimodal learning has recently revolutionized the state-of-the-art performance in multimodal tasks, relatively little is known about the robustness of multimodal learning in an adversarial setting. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive measurement of the adversarial robustness of multimodal learning by focusing on the fusion of input modalities in multimodal models, via a framework called MUROAN (MUltimodal RObustness ANalyzer). We first present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the fusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability. We then introduce a new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN that aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities. We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks.

In this paper, we investigate the use of deep learning for PBD across activity types, using wearable motion capture and surface electromyography data collected from healthy participants and people with chronic pain.

Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe evaluate\u00a0KalMamba\u00a0on several tasks from the DeepMind Control (DMC) Suite\u00a0[50], training an

By combining the benefits of deterministic and probabilistic SSMs, we can advance the field of RL and sequence modeling, leading to more efficient and reliable systems for complex tasks.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in integrating the efficiency of deterministic SSMs with the uncertainty awareness of probabilistic models. Naive approaches may fail due to the nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches of existing probabilistic SSMs, which do not scale well for long sequences in RL. Overcoming technical obstacles and designing a method that balances efficiency and uncertainty modeling is complex.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on either deterministic or probabilistic SSMs separately, lacking a comprehensive approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. The limitations of existing solutions have hindered the development of a method that efficiently handles uncertainty in long-sequence RL tasks. Our proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the advantages of both types of models.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing an architecture named KalMamba that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of deterministic models. We use Kalman filtering and smoothing to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space, incorporating a dynamics model based on Mamba. By parallelizing associative scans and formulating efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing, KalMamba achieves time-parallel computation of belief states for model learning and control. The expected outcome is an end-to-end model training approach under high levels of uncertainty, enabling the use of smoothed beliefs for policy learning and execution in RL tasks.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 59721218-2e1d-4b05-87fe-3ef41bc5303a \nFrom agent5 to agent1: Hello, I am agent5.

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata.

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process.

Addressing this issue can pave the way for more effective knowledge transfer and model adaptation, impacting future research by enhancing the robustness and applicability of machine learning algorithms.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe problem of domain shift poses challenges due to the significant divergence between source and target domains, limiting the effectiveness of existing adaptation methods like UDA. The complexities arise from the need to bridge substantial domain gaps, determine the transfer order of intermediate domains, and mitigate cumulative errors throughout the adaptation process. Naive approaches may fail to account for the nuances of domain continuity and metadata discrepancies, requiring sophisticated techniques to overcome technical and theoretical obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has faced limitations in effectively addressing domain shift, particularly in continuous adaptation scenarios where metadata may be missing or insufficient to explain data distribution differences. The lack of a clear transfer order for intermediate domains and the challenge of minimizing cumulative errors have hindered the resolution of this problem. Our approach aims to improve upon prior work by proposing innovative solutions that leverage advanced techniques like optimal transport and self-training to enhance adaptation model performance.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves leveraging continuous optimal transport (COT) and self-training techniques to progressively adapt models across intermediate domains, reducing domain shift and improving performance.

(2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples.

We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation.

Specifically, machine unlearning is to make a trained model to remove the contribution of an erased subset of the training dataset. This survey aims to systematically classify a wide range of machine unlearning and discuss their differences, connections and open problems. We categorize current unlearning methods into four scenarios: centralized unlearning, distributed and irregular data unlearning, unlearning verification, and privacy and security issues in unlearning. Since centralized unlearning is the primary domain, we use two parts to introduce: firstly, we classify centralized unlearning into exact unlearning and approximate unlearning; secondly, we offer a detailed introduction to the techniques of these methods. Besides the centralized unlearning, we notice some studies about distributed and irregular data unlearning and introduce federated unlearning and graph unlearning as the two representative directions. After introducing unlearning methods, we review studies about unlearning verification. Moreover, we consider the privacy and security issues essential in machine unlearning and organize the latest related literature.

However, existing studies of machine unlearning mainly focus on the efficacy and efficiency of unlearning methods, while neglecting the investigation of the privacy vulnerability during the unlearning process. With two versions of a model available to an adversary, that is, the original model and the unlearned model, machine unlearning opens up a new attack surface. In this paper, we conduct the first investigation to understand the extent to which machine unlearning can leak the confidential content of the unlearned data. Specifically, under the Machine Learning as a Service setting, we propose unlearning inversion attacks that can reveal the feature and label information of an unlearned sample by only accessing the original and unlearned model. The effectiveness of the proposed unlearning inversion attacks is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various model architectures and on both exact and approximate representative unlearning approaches. The experimental results indicate that the proposed attack can reveal the sensitive information of the unlearned data. As such, we identify three possible defenses that help to mitigate the proposed attacks, while at the cost of reducing the utility of the unlearned model. The study in this paper uncovers an underexplored gap between machine unlearning and the privacy of unlearned data, highlighting the need for the careful design of mechanisms for implementing unlearning without leaking the information of the unlearned data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03233v1\", \"timestamp\": 1712212666, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3b3cad73-d3bc-4063-96c1-6637effc4868\", \"authors\": [\"Cheng-Long Wang\", \"Qi Li\", \"Zihang Xiang\", \"Yinzhi Cao\", \"Di Wang\"], \"title\": \"Towards Lifecycle Unlearning Commitment Management: Measuring Sample-level Approximate Unlearning Completeness\", \"abstract\": \"By adopting a more flexible definition of unlearning and adjusting the model distribution to simulate training without the targeted data, approximate machine unlearning provides a less resource-demanding alternative to the more laborious exact unlearning methods. Yet, the unlearning completeness of target samples-even when the approximate algorithms are executed faithfully without external threats-remains largely unexamined, raising questions about those approximate algorithms' ability to fulfill their commitment of unlearning during the lifecycle.   In this paper, we introduce the task of Lifecycle Unlearning Commitment Management (LUCM) for approximate unlearning and outline its primary challenges. We propose an efficient metric designed to assess the sample-level unlearning completeness. Our empirical results demonstrate its superiority over membership inference techniques in two key areas: the strong correlation of its measurements with unlearning completeness across various unlearning tasks, and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Additionally, we show that this metric is able to serve as a tool for monitoring unlearning anomalies throughout the unlearning lifecycle, including both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.   We apply this metric to evaluate the unlearning commitments of current approximate algorithms. Our analysis, conducted across multiple unlearning benchmarks, reveals that these algorithms inconsistently fulfill their unlearning commitments due to two main issues: 1) unlearning new data can significantly affect the unlearning utility of previously requested data, and 2) approximate algorithms fail to ensure equitable unlearning utility across different groups. These insights emphasize the crucial importance of LUCM throughout the unlearning lifecycle.

This paper presents a novel approach to machine unlearning by employing Layer-wise Relevance Analysis and Neuronal Path Perturbation. We address three primary challenges: the lack of detailed unlearning principles, privacy guarantees in zero-shot unlearning scenario, and the balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Our method balances machine unlearning performance and model utility by identifying and perturbing highly relevant neurons, thereby achieving effective unlearning. By using data not present in the original training set during the unlearning process, we satisfy the zero-shot unlearning scenario and ensure robust privacy protection.

To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning.

Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

LLM unlearning aims at reducing their influence and avoid undesirable behaviours. However, existing unlearning methods remain vulnerable to adversarial queries and the unlearned knowledge resurfaces after the manually designed attack queries. As part of a red-team effort to proactively assess the vulnerabilities of unlearned models, we design Dynamic Unlearning Attack (DUA), a dynamic and automated framework to attack these models and evaluate their robustness. It optimizes adversarial suffixes to reintroduce the unlearned knowledge in various scenarios. We find that unlearned knowledge can be recovered in $55.2\\\\%$ of the questions, even without revealing the unlearned model's parameters. In response to this vulnerability, we propose Latent Adversarial Unlearning (LAU), a universal framework that effectively enhances the robustness of the unlearned process. It formulates the unlearning process as a min-max optimization problem and resolves it through two stages: an attack stage, where perturbation vectors are trained and added to the latent space of LLMs to recover the unlearned knowledge, and a defense stage, where previously trained perturbation vectors are used to enhance unlearned model's robustness. With our LAU framework, we obtain two robust unlearning methods, AdvGA and AdvNPO. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple unlearning benchmarks and various models, and demonstrate that they improve the unlearning effectiveness by over $53.5\\\\%$, cause only less than a $11.6\\\\%$ reduction in neighboring knowledge, and have almost no impact on the model's general capabilities.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10682v1\", \"timestamp\": 1724146564, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9b333edd-b3c4-4178-a796-86ff004f7c78\", \"authors\": [\"Jinghan Jia\", \"Jiancheng Liu\", \"Yihua Zhang\", \"Parikshit Ram\", \"Nathalie Baracaldo\", \"Sijia Liu\"], \"title\": \"WAGLE: Strategic Weight Attribution for Effective and Modular Unlearning in Large Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"The need for effective unlearning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly urgent, driven by the necessity to adhere to data regulations and foster ethical generative AI practices. Despite growing interest of LLM unlearning, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning, malicious use prevention, and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning.

Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use. However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work, we present \\\\textbf{Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts}, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency. Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference. We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting.

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on.

Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\\\\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models.

Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\\\\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models.

It can lead to advancements in image authenticity verification and accountability for model owners. This research can also pave the way for developing countermeasures against the misuse of text-to-image generation models.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in distinguishing fake images from real ones and attributing them to specific models accurately. Naive approaches may struggle due to the complexity of image generation and the need for sophisticated detection and attribution techniques. Technical obstacles include developing robust classifiers and identifying unique fingerprints left by different models in generated images.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research may have focused more on the generation aspect of text-to-image models rather than on detecting and attributing fake images. The complexity of the problem, coupled with the evolving nature of text-to-image models, could have hindered previous attempts to address this issue effectively. This new approach improves upon prior work by specifically targeting the detection and attribution of fake images.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves building a machine learning classifier to detect fake images and attributing them to their source models. The research utilizes various text-to-image generation models and benchmark datasets for experimentation. The expected outcomes include the identification of common artifacts in fake images, the effectiveness of attribution to source models, and insights into the impact of different prompts on image authenticity.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 7c754cd1-25ae-4708-afbc-da97b793c1d3 \nFrom agent9 to agent1: Hello, I am agent9.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors.

This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images.

This research could lead to advancements in human-robot interaction, real-time decision-making, and high-speed motion control, impacting future research in robotics and sports technology.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in combining high-level strategic decision-making with low-level physical skills required for executing those strategies in a dynamic and fast-paced sport like table tennis.

Introduction\n\nResearch on large language models (OpenAI, 2023) (LLMs) is expanding in scope and yielding significant scientific advancements rapidly. These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), BART (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022; Ni et\u00a0al., 2021; Pradeep et\u00a0al., 2023a). In addition to leveraging ICL for a purely generative task, e.g., question answering or abstractive summarisation (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023), a more common use is in a predictive task, such as text classification (Lu et\u00a0al., 2022; Milios et\u00a0al., 2023), where each class is specified by a set of words (commonly called a verbaliser (Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021)), e.g., for a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could be defined by the set {{\\{{\u2018good\u2019, \u2018great\u2019, \u2018wonderful\u2019\u2026}}\\}}.\nOnce each class for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated text can be mapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over the vocabulary generated by the decoder.\n\n\nIt is to be realised that ICL is somewhat conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples) - the only difference of ICL with k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN is that the former involves a frozen set of encoder-decoder parameters of an underlying LLM, where ICL generally works well on any domain with only a small number of examples because, unlike\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), BART (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et\u00a0al., 2023; Li et\u00a0al., 2022; Ni et\u00a0al., 2021; Pradeep et\u00a0al., 2023a). In addition to leveraging ICL for a purely generative task, e.g., question answering or abstractive summarisation (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2023; Tang et\u00a0al., 2023), a more common use is in a predictive task, such as text classification (Lu et\u00a0al., 2022; Milios et\u00a0al., 2023), where each class is specified by a set of words (commonly called a verbaliser (Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2021)), e.g., for a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could be defined by the set {{\\{{\u2018good\u2019, \u2018great\u2019, \u2018wonderful\u2019\u2026}}\\}}.\nOnce each class for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated text can be mapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over the vocabulary generated by the decoder.\n\n\nIt is to be realised that ICL is somewhat conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples) - the only difference of ICL with k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-NN is that the former involves a frozen set of encoder-decoder parameters of an underlying LLM, where ICL generally works well on any domain with only a small number of examples because, unlike\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top.

INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\u00a0(Krumm et\u00a0al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), news\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2018b) and e-commerce\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2020; Qin et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval. The latter will be detailed further in Section \u00a02.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in candidate sets (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly, utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements. As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\nIn contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing various feature interaction operators, such as product operators\u00a0(Qu et\u00a0al., 2016), convolutional operators\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2019a), and attention operators\u00a0(Xiao et\u00a0al., 2017).

Recently proposed end-to-end speaker diarization outperformed conventional clustering-based speaker diarization, but it has one drawback: it is less flexible in terms of the number of speakers. This paper proposes a method for encoder-decoder based attractor calculation (EDA), which first generates a flexible number of attractors from a speech embedding sequence. Then, the generated multiple attractors are multiplied by the speech embedding sequence to produce the same number of speaker activities. The speech embedding sequence is extracted using the conventional self-attentive end-to-end neural speaker diarization (SA-EEND) network. In a two-speaker condition, our method achieved a 2.69 % diarization error rate (DER) on simulated mixtures and a 8.07 % DER on the two-speaker subset of CALLHOME, while vanilla SA-EEND attained 4.56 % and 9.54 %, respectively.

Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's voice from a speech mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech segments by speaker, annotating `who spoke when'. Previous studies have typically treated the two tasks independently. In practical applications, it is more meaningful to have knowledge about `who spoke what and when', which is captured by the two tasks. The two tasks share a similar objective of disentangling speakers. Speaker extraction operates in the frequency domain, whereas diarization is in the temporal domain. It is logical to believe that speaker activities obtained from speaker diarization can benefit speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker activity detection than the speech mixture. In this paper, we propose a unified model called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED) to address output inconsistency and scenario mismatch issues. It is designed to manage speech mixture with varying overlap ratios and variable number of speakers. We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the competitive baselines for speaker extraction and diarization tasks on LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets.

Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows improved sensitivity (93.42%), specificity (82.39%), and diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03572v2\", \"timestamp\": 1494375623, \"domain\": \"cs.NE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"63fd8b99-df4b-4106-a5e0-1b92318d4ceb\", \"authors\": [\"Clemens Isert\", \"Kenneth Atz\", \"Gisbert Schneider\"], \"title\": \"Structure-based drug design with geometric deep learning\", \"abstract\": \"Structure-based drug design uses three-dimensional geometric information of macromolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, to identify suitable ligands.

We first introduce the concept of inverse modified differential equations (IMDE) for linear multistep methods and show that the learned model returns a close approximation of the IMDE.

Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows improved sensitivity (93.42%), specificity (82.39%), and diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03572v2\", \"timestamp\": 1494375623, \"domain\": \"cs.NE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"63fe8aac-cd1c-494b-ad32-7a6d431a9586\", \"authors\": [\"Clemens Isert\", \"Kenneth Atz\", \"Gisbert Schneider\"], \"title\": \"Structure-based drug design with geometric deep learning\", \"abstract\": \"Structure-based drug design uses three-dimensional geometric information of macromolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, to identify suitable ligands.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC. Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework\nFinally, we introduce the fully adaptive h-DJSCC frame-\nwork. We will first discuss the variable rate h-DJSCC frame-\nwork with a fixed \u03b7value, inspired by [21]\u2013[23] for image\ncompression.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12.

Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length. The aim of this paper is to mathematically prove this property and present a case study application in an electric machine.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07235v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731351270, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e65298bf-0fd5-40b6-b19d-9dcb12806f68\", \"authors\": [\"Alexandra Lamtyugina\", \"Agnish Kumar Behera\", \"Aditya Nandy\", \"Carlos Floyd\", \"Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan\"], \"title\": \"Score-based generative diffusion with \\\"active\\\" correlated noise sources\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the underlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the approximated distribution.

It can also pave the way for innovations in deep joint source-channel coding strategies, contributing to the development of more effective transmission schemes.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe problem is complex due to the diverse nature of link qualities in mobile multi-hop networks, which require a robust transmission scheme that can adapt to varying conditions. Existing deep joint source-channel coding strategies face limitations at the intersection of analog and digital methods, making it challenging to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, the need for a fully adaptive framework adds another layer of complexity, as it involves training models to provide satisfactory rate-distortion performance for each point on the rate-distortion curve.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has shown that naive initialization methods can lead to suboptimal solutions, highlighting the need for more sophisticated approaches. The variability in link qualities and the intricacies of deep joint source-channel coding strategies have posed challenges that existing solutions have struggled to overcome.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort. Crucially, for\nlower values of t\ud835\udc61titalic_t,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort. Crucially, for\nlower values of t\ud835\udc61titalic_t,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Using this representation we show that: (1) a \\\"sweet spot\\\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.

To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset.

Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already.

However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a \\\"sweet spot\\\" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks.

To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification.

Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph neural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small graphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks instead.

The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components through pretraining. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI.

We experimented with state-of-the-art vision and language models and found that the best (22%) performed substantially worse than humans (97%). We release our dataset, benchmark, and code, in hopes of driving the development of models that can better understand figurative language.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15445v3\", \"timestamp\": 1679939995, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"5239b68a-ea8c-46c1-a90c-a8e48cc7c889\", \"authors\": [\"Naman Sharma\"], \"title\": \"CXR-Agent: Vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation with uncertainty aware radiology reporting\", \"abstract\": \"Recently large vision-language models have shown potential when interpreting complex images and generating natural language descriptions using advanced reasoning. Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stress the importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately. Finally, we emphasise the need for larger paired (scan and report) datasets alongside data augmentation to tackle overfitting seen in these large vision-language models.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08811v1\", \"timestamp\": 1720723159, \"domain\": \"eess.IV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ede148d6-ab9a-4b90-9df7-48e8de269e15\", \"authors\": [\"Eliana Pastor\", \"Alkis Koudounas\", \"Giuseppe Attanasio\", \"Dirk Hovy\", \"Elena Baralis\"], \"title\": \"Explaining Speech Classification Models via Word-Level Audio Segments and Paralinguistic Features\", \"abstract\": \"Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) have provided new insights into how models for vision, language, and tabular data operate.

We introduce a new approach to explain speech classification models.

We validate our approach by explaining two state-of-the-art SLU models on two speech classification tasks in English and Italian.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance.

The calculation of true gradients for backpropagation in spiking neural networks is impeded by the non-differentiable firing events of spiking neurons. On the other hand, using approximate gradients is effective, but computationally expensive over many time steps. One common technique, then, for training a spiking neural network is to train a topologically-equivalent non-spiking network, and then convert it to an spiking network, replacing real-valued inputs with proportionally rate-encoded Poisson spike trains. Converted SNNs function sufficiently well because the mean pre-firing membrane potential of a spiking neuron is proportional to the dot product of the input rate vector and the neuron weight vector, similar to the functionality of a non-spiking network. However, this conversion only considers the mean and not the temporal variance of the membrane potential. As the standard deviation of the pre-firing membrane potential is proportional to the L4-norm of the neuron weight vector, we propose a weight adjustment based on the L4-norm during the conversion process in order to improve classification accuracy of the converted network.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09446v1\", \"timestamp\": 1637192000, \"domain\": \"cs.NE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ba5e9076-2f48-479d-b23d-672ccc25ad4e\", \"authors\": [\"Timo C.

It is an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful neural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using only so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in neuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on adaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information in spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while homeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of spiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic plasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream spiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry out asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing identical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we show that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU neurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate that this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional neural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up to) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes. Additionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified, we show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared to the corresponding ANN.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02053v1\", \"timestamp\": 1473265801, \"domain\": \"cs.NE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"8061784c-0880-4050-bbac-f50960a27cc7\", \"authors\": [\"Dongsung Huh\", \"Terrence J.

We construct these threads by estimating the degree of causal relatedness between pairs of spikes, then use these estimates to construct a directed acyclic graph that traces how the network activity evolves through individual spikes. We find that this graph of spiking activity naturally decomposes into disjoint connected components that overlap in space and time, which we call Graphical Neural Activity Threads (GNATs). We provide an efficient algorithm for finding analogous threads that reoccur in large spiking datasets, revealing that seemingly distinct spike trains are composed of similar underlying threads of activity, a hallmark of compositionality.

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies.

Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$.

Specifically, our procedure uncovers an implicit bias towards WEIRD contexts in models' \\\"default\\\" responses and we find that models are not equally sensitive to following different contexts, even when they are provided in prompts.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07237v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731351518, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": false, \"error-msg\": \"Paper not found.\"}"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:I will start by conducting a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in the area of merging homologous models using the DELLA approach.

It can advance the field by providing a more efficient way to leverage information across tasks and improve model performance.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in reducing interference among model parameters while retaining useful information for effective merging. Naive approaches may fail to strike the right balance between dropping delta parameters and maintaining task performance. Technical obstacles include determining the optimal drop rate for different model combinations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has shown limitations in maintaining separate fine-tuned models for each task, leading to the exploration of merging homologous models. However, finding the optimal approach to merge these models effectively while addressing interference and maintaining performance is a complex problem that requires innovative solutions.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves the DELLA approach, consisting of three steps: MAG-PRUNE for delta parameter drops, sign-based delta parameter selection, and fusion of selected delta parameters. The dataset includes three homologous models (LM, Math, Code) and their corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaEval, GSM8K, MBPP).

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset.

The original dDGM architecture used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static embedding space.

This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models.

The core of recommender system is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate, purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n(CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\nprediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6,19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user \u2014 more specifically, her one-hop neighbors \u2014 to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al. [ 39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network (GCN) [ 14,23], following the samearXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020propagation rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation, and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results of the 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n\u2022The best setting in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n\u2022The second best setting is using L1normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e., LightGCN- L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n\u2022Normalizing symmetrically on two sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness.

We speculate that such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN\u2019s effectiveness. To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU=MX\nu=1MX\nv=1cv\u2192u(eu\n||eu||2\u2212ev\n||ev||2)2, (17)\nwhere the L2norm on embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding\u2019s scale.

Note that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is much lower\nthan that of MF.

The core of recommender system is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate, purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n(CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\nprediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6,19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user \u2014 more specifically, her one-hop neighbors \u2014 to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al. [ 39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network (GCN) [ 14,23], following the samearXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020propagation rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation, and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results of the 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n\u2022The best setting in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n\u2022The second best setting is using L1normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e., LightGCN- L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n\u2022Normalizing symmetrically on two sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness. As we have analyzed\nin Section 3.2.3, a 2-layer LightGCN smooths a user\u2019s embedding\nbased on the users that have overlap on her interacted items, and\nthe smoothing strength between two users cv\u2192uis measured in\nEquation (14). We speculate that such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN\u2019s effectiveness. To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU=MX\nu=1MX\nv=1cv\u2192u(eu\n||eu||2\u2212ev\n||ev||2)2, (17)\nwhere the L2norm on embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding\u2019s scale. Similarly we can obtained the\ndefinition for item embeddings. Table 6 shows the smoothness\nof two models, matrix factorization (i.e., using the E(0)for model\nprediction) and the 2-layer LightGCN-single (i.e., using the E(2)for\nprediction). Note that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is much lower\nthan that of MF. This indicates that by conducting light graph\nconvolution, the embeddings become smoother and more suitable\nfor recommendation.01e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2\nRegularization0.0200.0250.0300.0350.0400.0450.0500.0550.060recall@20\n01e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2\nRegularization0.0100.0150.0200.0250.0300.0350.0400.0450.050ndcg@20\nFigure 5: Performance of 2-layer LightGCN w.r.t. different\nregularization coefficient \u03bbon Yelp and Amazon-Book.\n4.5 Hyper-parameter Studies\nWhen applying LightGCN to a new dataset, besides the standard\nhyper-parameter learning rate,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

We then analyze key properties of the new link recommendation problem and develop a novel link recommendation method to solve the problem. Using two large-scale online social network data sets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over representative diversification methods adapted for link recommendation as well as state-of-the-art link recommendation methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10689v2\", \"timestamp\": 1653173940, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can deviation-based learning be effectively utilized to train recommender systems and improve user choice?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem can lead to more informed user choices, better learning rates, and improved social welfare in recommender systems. It can advance the field by introducing a novel approach that considers user knowledge and behavior in the learning process, potentially leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in predicting user choices accurately based on deviations from recommendations and understanding the impact of different choices on user behavior. Naive approaches may struggle to capture the complexity of user decision-making and may not effectively adapt to changing user preferences.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research may have focused more on traditional recommendation methods without considering deviation-based learning. The barriers could include the complexity of modeling user behavior deviations and the need for a deeper understanding of user decision-making processes. This approach differs by incorporating user knowledge and behavior feedback into the learning process, leading to more informed recommendations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves utilizing deviation-based learning to train recommender systems, analyzing user choices, and improving learning rates.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face.

In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, and keeps multi-view consistency and style consistency between multimodal guidance.

To this end, we take advantage of a generalizable NeRF model to facilitate style transfer in 3D, thereby enabling the use of a single learned model across various scenes. By incorporating a hypernetwork into a generalizable NeRF, our approach enables on-the-fly generation of stylized novel views.

We evaluate our method across various scenes and artistic styles and show its performance in generating high-quality and multi-view consistent stylized images without the need for a scene-specific implicit model.

Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer.

Here, we use deep learning and artificial intelligence to discover a mathematical model for the progression of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal tau positron emission tomography from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Specifically, we integrate physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and symbolic regression to discover a reaction-diffusion type partial differential equation for tau protein misfolding and spreading. First, we demonstrate the potential of our model and parameter discovery on synthetic data. Then, we apply our method to discover the best model and parameters to explain tau imaging data from 46 individuals who are likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and 30 healthy controls. Our symbolic regression discovers different misfolding models $f(c)$ for two groups, with a faster misfolding for the Alzheimer's group, $f(c) = 0.23c^3 - 1.34c^2 + 1.11c$, than for the healthy control group, $f(c) = -c^3 +0.62c^2 + 0.39c$. Our results suggest that PINNs, supplemented by symbolic regression, can discover a reaction-diffusion type model to explain misfolded tau protein concentrations in Alzheimer's disease.

This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample, recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1). Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n\u00a9 S. Hanneke, S. Moran & T. Waknine.arXiv:2403.10889v1  [cs.LG]  16 Mar 2024HANNEKE MORAN WAKNINE\nFigure 1: Amazon recommendation system gives their users a short list of books based on their past reading,\naiming that one of those books will capture their interest.\nbetween finite Daniely-Shwartz (DS) dimension and multiclass learnability. Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1. Our Contribution\nIn this section we summarize our main methods for simultaneously handling multiple instances of\na task than addressing them one by one. As an example, consider an n\u00d7nmatrix Aand the objective of\ncalculating its product with an input column vector x, where the computational resource Cis the number\nof arithmetic operations. For a single vector x, it is easy to see that \u0398(n2)operations are necessary and\nsufficient. However, if instead of one input vector x, there are ninput vectors x1, . . . , x nthen one can do\nbetter than n\u00d7\u0398(n2)\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

We present a novel and scalable approach to learn nearly optimal rule lists from large datasets. Our algorithm uses sampling to efficiently obtain an approximation of the optimal rule list with rigorous guarantees on the quality of the approximation. In particular, our algorithm guarantees to find a rule list with accuracy very close to the optimal rule list when a rule list with high accuracy exists. Our algorithm builds on the VC-dimension of rule lists, for which we prove novel upper and lower bounds. Our experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that our algorithm identifies nearly optimal rule lists with a speed-up up to two orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art exact approaches. Moreover, our algorithm is as fast as, and sometimes faster than, recent heuristic approaches, while reporting higher quality rule lists.

In fact, our learning-augmented skip list is still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant factor. We show that if the search queries follow the ubiquitous Zipfian distribution, then the expected search time for an item by our skip list is only a constant, independent of the total number $n$ of items, i.e., $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$, whereas a traditional skip list will have an expected search time of $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n)$. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structure achieves an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect.

This research can pave the way for improved performance in real-world scenarios where critical features are spread across multiple tables, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning applications in diverse domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity lies in effectively incorporating relational information from multiple tables into predictive models, as existing approaches often prioritize feature engineering and table flattening over exploiting rich network effects. Naive methods may fail due to the lack of established benchmarks and the challenges in handling dynamic RDBs commonly encountered in practice. Technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles need to be overcome to achieve optimal performance in predictive modeling over RDB data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nThe problem persists due to the limited focus on handling multiple tables and RDBs in predictive tasks, as well as the lack of established benchmarks for evaluating ML models in this domain. Previous research has been constrained by the absence of clear comparisons between diverse candidate approaches, hindering the identification of preferable methods under specific circumstances. This research proposal aims to address these gaps and limitations by proposing innovative solutions and methodologies to advance knowledge in this research area.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing a generic supervised learning formulation for handling dynamic RDBs in both inductive and transductive settings. The method will include a sampling/distillation operator to extract information from multiple tables and heterogeneous features, enabling the prediction of entity attributes and relationships in RDB data. The dataset will consist of raw data from multiple tables, and the evaluation metrics will focus on transductive, inductive, and temporal tasks. The expected outcomes include improved predictive modeling performance over RDB data, with the potential for practical applications in various industries.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 4d6598a8-ff6c-4929-8367-960dc88ae8f2 \nFrom agent2 to agent1: Hello, I am agent2.

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that $M_\\\\bullet \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a population of under-massive black holes ($M_\\\\bullet=10-10^5 M_\\\\odot$) in galaxies with $\\\\sigma \\\\lesssim 127$ km/s and over-massive black holes ($M_\\\\bullet \\\\geq 1.8 \\\\times 10^7$) above this threshold. This reveals an unexpected abundance of galaxies with intermediate-mass and ultramassive black holes, accessible to next-generation telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07242v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731351599, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ef09b72c-f5f4-4f6e-9d25-3fa4fb12df75\", \"authors\": [\"Daniel McGinnis\", \"Nikola Sadovek\"], \"title\": \"A necessary and sufficient condition for $k$-transversals\", \"abstract\": \"We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of convex sets in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$ to admit a $k$-transversal, for any $0 \\\\le k \\\\le d-1$.

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning, applying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult to learn only using random initialization.

For instance, a good response to a subjective query like \\\"What book should I read next?\\\" would depend on the user's preferences, and a good response to an open-ended query like \\\"How do antibiotics work against bacteria?\\\" would depend on the user's expertise. This makes evaluation of responses to such queries an ill-posed task, as evaluators may make arbitrary judgments about the response quality. To remedy this, we present contextualized evaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding an underspecified query and provides it during evaluation. We find that the presence of context can 1) alter conclusions drawn from evaluation, even flipping win rates between model pairs, 2) nudge evaluators to make fewer judgments based on surface-level criteria, like style, and 3) provide new insights about model behavior across diverse contexts.

We show that these floquet topological solitons are robust and they navigate around defects, allowing for agile tunability of the comb line spacing.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length.

From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata. Similarly, we randomly select an equal number of benign\npayload entries as malicious entries to balance the final dataset.\nThe benign entries are labeled as 0.

Experimental results using 1.2 million Android applications across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families, shows that self-supervised learning can achieve an accuracy of 97% for the binary classification of malware which is higher than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our proposed model is also able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class malware classification of types and family with macro-F1 score of .497 and .491 respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07049v1\", \"timestamp\": 1660549798, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a50134b3-b137-4550-b5b7-277f00ec74f5\", \"authors\": [\"Omid Kargarnovin\", \"Amir Mahdi Sadeghzadeh\", \"Rasool Jalili\"], \"title\": \"Mal2GCN: A Robust Malware Detection Approach Using Deep Graph Convolutional Networks With Non-Negative Weights\", \"abstract\": \"With the growing pace of using Deep Learning (DL) to solve various problems, securing these models against adversaries has become one of the main concerns of researchers. Recent studies have shown that DL-based malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversary can create carefully crafted adversarial examples to evade DL-based malware detectors. In this paper, we propose Mal2GCN, a robust malware detection model that uses Function Call Graph (FCG) representation of executable files combined with Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to detect Windows malware. Since FCG representation of executable files is more robust than raw byte sequence representation, numerous proposed adversarial example generating methods are ineffective in evading Mal2GCN. Moreover, we use the non-negative training method to transform Mal2GCN to a monotonically non-decreasing function; thereby, it becomes theoretically robust against appending attacks. We then present a black-box source code-based adversarial malware generation approach that can be used to evaluate the robustness of malware detection models against real-world adversaries. The proposed approach injects adversarial codes into the various locations of malware source codes to evade malware detection models. The experiments demonstrate that Mal2GCN with non-negative weights has high accuracy in detecting Windows malware, and it is also robust against adversarial attacks that add benign features to the Malware source code.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12473v2\", \"timestamp\": 1630093333, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"aa38b02d-36ac-429d-8078-64f31709e77e\", \"authors\": [\"Kun Li\", \"Fan Zhang\", \"Wei Guo\"], \"title\": \"FGAM:Fast Adversarial Malware Generation Method Based on Gradient Sign\", \"abstract\": \"Malware detection models based on deep learning have been widely used, but recent research shows that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are to deceive the deep learning model by generating adversarial samples. When adversarial attacks are performed on the malware detection model, the attacker will generate adversarial malware with the same malicious functions as the malware, and make the detection model classify it as benign software. Studying adversarial malware generation can help model designers improve the robustness of malware detection models. At present, in the work on adversarial malware generation for byte-to-image malware detection models, there are mainly problems such as large amount of injection perturbation and low generation efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes FGAM (Fast Generate Adversarial Malware), a method for fast generating adversarial malware, which iterates perturbed bytes according to the gradient sign to enhance adversarial capability of the perturbed bytes until the adversarial malware is successfully generated. It is experimentally verified that the success rate of the adversarial malware deception model generated by FGAM is increased by about 84\\\\% compared with existing methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12770v1\", \"timestamp\": 1684738714, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"97240a7b-5f96-47c1-8455-722fdb5a9653\", \"authors\": [\"Pascal Maniriho\", \"Abdun Naser Mahmood\", \"Mohammad Jabed Morshed Chowdhury\"], \"title\": \"MalDetConv: Automated Behaviour-based Malware Detection Framework Based on Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning Techniques\", \"abstract\": \"The popularity of Windows attracts the attention of hackers/cyber-attackers, making Windows devices the primary target of malware attacks in recent years. Several sophisticated malware variants and anti-detection methods have been significantly enhanced and as a result, traditional malware detection techniques have become less effective. This work presents MalBehavD-V1, a new behavioural dataset of Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from benign and malware executable files using the dynamic analysis approach. In addition, we present MalDetConV, a new automated behaviour-based framework for detecting both existing and zero-day malware attacks. MalDetConv uses a text processing-based encoder to transform features of API calls into a suitable format supported by deep learning models. It then uses a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) automatic feature extractor to select high-level features of the API Calls which are then fed to a fully connected neural network module for malware classification. MalDetConv also uses an explainable component that reveals features that contributed to the final classification outcome, helping the decision-making process for security analysts. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using our MalBehavD-V1 dataset and other benchmark datasets. The detection results demonstrate the effectiveness of MalDetConv over the state-of-the-art techniques with detection accuracy of 96.10%, 95.73%, 98.18%, and 99.93% achieved while detecting unseen malware from MalBehavD-V1, Allan and John, Brazilian, and Ki-D datasets, respectively.
