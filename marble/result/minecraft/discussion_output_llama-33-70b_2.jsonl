message indicating that the position [-9, -60, -3] is in the air suggests that agent2 needs to analyze the blueprint and determine the correct order of placement for the blocks.\n\nThe recommended next steps for agent2 are:\n\n1. **Analyze the blueprint**: Determine the correct order of placement for the blocks based on their positions, materials, and facing directions.\n2. **Design auxiliary blocks**: Identify blocks that need to be placed in the air and design auxiliary blocks to support them, as already done for position [-9, -60, -3].\n3. **Inform agent1**: Notify agent1 of the correct order of placement for the target blocks.\n4. **Inform agent3**: Provide instructions on when to place and remove the auxiliary blocks.\n\nTo complete these tasks, agent2 can call the following action functions:\n\n1. `designAuxiliaryBlocks` with the blueprint as an argument to design the auxiliary blocks needed to support the target blocks.\n2. `informAgent1` with the correct order of placement as an argument to notify agent1.\n3. `informAgent3` with the auxiliary blocks and placement instructions as arguments to guide agent3.\n\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"action_function_call\",\n

and the exact arguments would depend on the details of the task and the capabilities of the agents.\n\nTherefore, the next task for agent2 is to call the `designAuxiliaryBlocks` function with the blueprint as an argument, followed by calling the `informAgent1` function with the correct order of placement as an argument, and finally calling the `informAgent3` function with the auxiliary blocks and placement instructions as arguments.\n\nThe next task could be: \n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"action_function_call\",\n  \"action_name\": \"designAuxiliaryBlocks\",\n  \"args\": {\"blueprint\":

Agent2 should design auxiliary blocks to support these blocks, such as blocks at positions [-10 -61 2], [-9 -61 2], and [-8 -61 2].\n\nAfter designing the auxiliary blocks, agent2 should inform agent1 of the correct order of placing the target blocks and inform agent3 when to put the auxiliary blocks and when to remove them.\n\nAdditionally, agent2 should also ensure that agent3 has the necessary materials, such as dirt and a ladder, to erect the dirt ladder to support the blocks that need to be placed in the air. If agent3 does not have the necessary materials, agent2 should instruct agent3 to obtain them before proceeding with the task.\n\nTherefore, the next task for agent2 is to:\n\n* Identify the blocks that need to be placed first to provide a foundation for the other blocks.\n* Design auxiliary blocks to support the blocks that need to be placed in the air.\n* Inform agent1 of the correct order of placing the target blocks.\n* Inform agent3 when to put auxiliary blocks and when to remove them.\n* Ensure that agent3 has the necessary materials to erect the dirt ladder.\n\nBy completing these tasks, agent2 can ensure that the building is constructed according to the blueprint and that the blocks are placed in a stable and correct order. \n\nThe next task for agent2 is to inform agent1 of the correct order", "agent3": "The next task for agent3 should be to place a dirt_path block at position [-8, -60, 1] using the 'placeBlock' action.\n\nHere is the next task:\n\n{\"type\": \"action_function_call\", \"action_name\": \"placeBlock\", \"args\": {\"item_name\": \"dirt_path\", \"x\": -8, \"y\": -60, \"z\": 1, \"facing\": \"A\", \"player_name\": \"agent3\"}}\n\nThis task will allow agent3 to place another dirt_path block at the specified position, continuing the construction of the building according to the blueprint.\n\nNote: The task is chosen based on the provided blueprint and the fact that agent3 has already placed dirt_path blocks at positions [-10, -60, 0] and [-9, -60, -2]. The next task is to place another dirt_path block at a nearby position, which is [-8, -60, 1]. This task is consistent with the Minecraft game rules and the provided blueprint.\n\nAlso, note that the memory contains the result of the previous tasks, including the successful placement of dirt_path blocks at positions [-10, -60, 0] and [-9, -60, -2], and the withdrawal of dirt_path items from the chest. This information can be used to inform the next task and ensure that agent3 is making progress towards completing the building according to the blueprint. \n\nHowever, before placing the block, agent3 should check if it has the dirt_path item in hand.

When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6. If their is no items in the chest, maybe you can find the item at other chest or get it from other agent or dig it up or craft it.\n7. One bucket can hold one item, if you want to get more items, you need to get more buckets at first.\n8. You are in a team with other agents, you can try to find the item from other agents, and do not change the blocks other agents placed without permission.\n*** The blueprint ***\n[\n    \"[material:farmland facing:A positions:[[-11 -60 0] [-10 -60 0] [-9 -60 0] [-11 -60 2] [-9 -60 2]]]\",\n    \"material: dirt facing: A position: [-10, -60, 2]\",\n    \"[material:cut_sandstone facing:A positions:[[-10 -60 -3] [-8 -60 -1] [-8 -60 0] [-8 -60 1]]]\",\n    \"[material:farmland facing:A positions:[[-11 -60 -2] [-10 -60 -2] [-9 -60 -2]]]\",\n    \"[material:cut_sandstone facing:A positions:[[-12 -60 -1] [-12 -60 1] [-10 -60 3]]]\",\n    \"material: smooth_sandstone_stairs facing: W position: [-8, -60, 2]\",\n    \"material: smooth_sandstone_stairs facing: E position: [-12, -60, 2]\",\n    \"[material:smooth_sandstone_stairs facing:W positions:[[-8 -60 -3] [-8 -60 -2]]]\",\n    \"[material:smooth_sandstone_stairs positions:[position:[-12 -60 -3] facing:E position:[-11 -60 -3] facing:S position:[-9 -60 -3] facing:S position:[-12 -60 -2] facing:E]]\",\n    \"[material:smooth_sandstone_stairs facing:N positions:[[-9 -60 3] [-8 -60 3]]]\",\n    \"[material:smooth_sandstone_stairs facing:N positions:[[-12 -60 3] [-11 -60 3]]]\",\n    \"material: composter facing: A position: [-10, -59, 2]\"\n]"}, "task_results": [{"agent_id": "agent1", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"message\": \"move failed, can not reach position 0 -61 0, the position is blocked, check the environment\", \"status\": false}"}, {"agent_id": "agent2", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"message\": \"move failed, can not reach position -11 -61 0, the position is blocked, check the environment\", \"status\": false}"}, {"agent_id": "agent3", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"data\": [{\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"dirt\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"dirt\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"dirt\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"ladder\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"ladder\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"smooth_sandstone_stairs\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"cut_sandstone\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"farmland\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"composter\"}], \"message\": \" open chest, (didn't get them out; try the withdraw api to get them out)It contains:dirt dirt dirt ladder ladder smooth_sandstone_stairs cut_sandstone farmland composter \", \"status\": true}"}], "summary": "Agent 1 and Agent 2 both encountered obstacles and were unable to reach their designated positions to build the structure according to the blueprint.

I've had similar issues with placing blocks in the air. From my past experiences, I've learned that I need to place support blocks first before placing the target block. For example, in my memory, I have an instance where I tried to place a dirt_path block at (-10, -60, -3) but failed because there was no valid reference block.

What are your thoughts on this?\nFrom agent2 to agent1: I think that's a great approach to designing our plan. Using auxiliary blocks made from dirt, ladder, and dirt_path from agent3's chest to support the target blocks is a good idea. We can start by placing a dirt block at position (-10, -60, -4) and then work our way up. I'll communicate the plan to agent3 and inform them when to place and remove the auxiliary blocks.
