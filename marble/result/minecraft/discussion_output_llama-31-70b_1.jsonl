You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6.

The positions specified by agent2 are likely chosen to provide a foundation for the blocks outlined in the blueprint.\\n\\n**Blueprint Analysis:**\\n\\nThe blueprint contains four entries, each describing a set of blocks to be placed. The first entry describes a series of blocks with positions ranging from [-12 -60 -2] to [-10 -60 1].
