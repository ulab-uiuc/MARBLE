Agent1 responds with the correct sequence, which is then repeated multiple times. This suggests that Agent1 has already understood the instructions and has placed the blocks accordingly.\\n\\n**Action Items and Outcomes:**\\n\\n1. Agent1 has confirmed that they have placed the blocks in the correct order.\\n2. Agent2 should move on to the next task, which is to inform Agent3 about when to put auxiliary blocks and when to remove them.\\n\\n**Next Task:**\\n\\nBased on the conversation history, the next task for Agent2 is to check with Agent1 to confirm that they have already placed the blocks in the correct order. If Agent1 has indeed placed the blocks correctly, Agent2 can proceed with informing Agent3 about the auxiliary blocks and their removal schedule.\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n\\nTo optimize the workflow, Agent2 should verify with Agent1 that they have completed the task correctly before moving on to the next step.
