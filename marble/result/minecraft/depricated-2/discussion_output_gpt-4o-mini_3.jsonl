When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6. If their is no items in the chest, maybe you can find the item at other chest or get it from other agent or dig it up or craft it.\n7. One bucket can hold one item, if you want to get more items, you need to get more buckets at first.\n8. You are in a team with other agents, you can try to find the item from other agents, and do not change the blocks other agents placed without permission.\n*** The blueprint ***\n[\n    \"[material:dirt_path facing:A positions:[start:[-9 -60 -7] end:[-9 -60 7]]]\",\n    \"[material:dirt facing:A positions:[[-9 -60 -8] [-8 -60 -1] [-8 -60 0] [-8 -60 1] [-8 -60 2] [-9 -60 8]]]\",\n    \"[material:dirt_path facing:A positions:[start:[-10 -60 -8] end:[-10 -60 8]]]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -2]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -3]\",\n    \"[material:dirt_path facing:A positions:[start:[-8 -60 3] end:[-8 -60 8]]]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -4]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -5]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -6]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -7]\",\n    \"material: dirt_path facing: A position: [-8, -60, -8]\"\n]"}, "task_results": [{"agent_id": "agent1", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"data\": [{\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"dirt\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"dirt\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"ladder\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"ladder\"}, {\"count\": 64, \"name\": \"dark_oak_log\"}], \"message\": \" open chest, (didn't get them out; try the withdraw api to get them out)It contains:dirt dirt ladder ladder dark_oak_log \", \"status\": true}"}, {"agent_id": "agent2", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"message\": \"{'my_name': 'agent2', 'health': 20, 'food': 20, 'saturation': 0, 'oxygen': 20, 'timeOfDay': 'sunrise', 'equipment': 'hidden', 'I_held_item': {},\\n 'inventory': [], 'my_position': [-13, -59, -18], 'nearby_entities': [{'other_entity': 'agent1', 'agent1': [-3, -59, 0]},\\n {'other_entity': 'agent3', 'agent3': [-3, -59, -1], 'heldItem': 'spruce_planks'},\\n {'bat': [-25, -59, -13]},\\n {'bat': [-1, -51, -34]},\\n {'bat': [-10, -50, -43]}]}stone_bricks at [-14, -61, -19]\\nglass at [-14, -60, -20]\\nglass at [-14, -59, -20]\\nstone_bricks at [-13, -61, -19]\\nglass at [-13, -60, -20]\\nstone_bricks at [-15, -61, -19]\\ntuff at [-14, -44, -20]\\ntuff at [-13, -44, -20]\\ndeepslate at [-15, -44, -20]\\ndeepslate at [-14, -43, -20]\\ndeepslate at [-12, -44, -20]\\ntuff at [-7, -44, -20]\\nspruce_fence at [-4, -60, -3]\\nspruce_planks at [-3, -60, -3]\\nbedrock at [-4, -61, -3]\\nspruce_planks at [-3, -59, -3]\\nspruce_planks at [-3, -60, -2]\\nbedrock at [-4, -61, -2]\\ncrafting_table at [-4, -60, -1]\\nchest at [-4, -60, 0]\\ndeepslate_redstone_ore at [-1, -44, -18]\\nfurnace at [-4, -60, 1]\\ndeepslate_redstone_ore at [-1, -43, -18]\\ndeepslate_redstone_ore at [-1, -44, -17]\\noak_wall_sign at [-3, -58, 0]\\ndeepslate_iron_ore at [-20, -39, -14]\\nspruce_fence at [-4, -60, 3]\\n\", \"status\": true}"}, {"agent_id": "agent3", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"message\": \"can not place block, no dirt_path in hand, you need to interact chest or other container to get item first\", \"status\": false}"}], "summary": "Agent 1 successfully retrieved the necessary materials (dirt, ladder, dark oak log) from the chest but did not take them out.

A message could be:\n     - \"Has anyone found any dark oak materials while searching?\"\n\n5. **Consider Alternative Sources**:\n   - If agent1 manages to find any dark oak logs, they should craft the necessary items (fences, stairs, and slabs) as soon as possible. If no dark oak materials are found, consider gathering other materials that might be useful for the build or look for crafting recipes that could utilize the materials currently in inventory (like dirt or smooth sandstone).\n\n6. **Communicate Progress**:\n   - Keep agent2 updated on any progress or findings. If agent1 finds any materials or encounters other agents, they should inform agent2 immediately.\n\n### Summary of Immediate Actions:\n- **Search for dark oak trees** in different biomes or areas.\n- **Expand the search radius** beyond 100 blocks if necessary.\n- **Look for other chests** that might contain the required materials.\n- **Ask other agents** for dark oak materials.\n- **Consider crafting** if any dark oak logs are found.\n- **Update agent2** on progress and findings.\n\nThis structured approach will help agent1 efficiently continue their tasks while maximizing the chances of finding the necessary materials for the building project.", "agent2": "Based on the current situation, agent2 should proceed with the following tasks:\n\n1. **Continue Searching for Dark Oak Trees**: Since agent2 has not found any dark oak wood or dark oak fence in the nearby area, they should actively search for dark oak trees to gather wood. This wood can then be crafted into dark oak fence.\n\n2. **Coordinate with Agent3**: Agent2 should reach out to agent3 to see if they have found any dark oak materials or if they are exploring a different area. They can say:\n   - \"Agent3, have you found any dark oak materials? Let's coordinate our search to cover more ground.\"\n\n3. **Plan Block Placement**: While searching, agent2 should continue to plan the placement of dark oak logs and slabs based on the blueprint. They should keep track of the positions and orientations to ensure a smooth building process once the materials are obtained.\n\n4. **Instruct Agent3 on Auxiliary Blocks**: If agent2 identifies any blocks that need to be placed in the air, they should instruct agent3 to prepare to place auxiliary blocks to support those placements once the necessary materials are obtained.\n\n### Next Task for Agent2:\n- **Search for Dark Oak Trees**: \"I will look for dark oak trees to gather wood for crafting dark oak fence.\"\n- **Coordinate with Agent3**: \"Agent3, have you found any dark oak materials?

If they encounter any crafting tables, they can use them to create bone_blocks from the bones collected.\n\n5. **Monitor for Responses**: Continue to keep an eye out for any responses from other agents regarding the availability of bone_blocks.\n\n### Follow-Up Actions:\n- If bones are collected, proceed to craft bone_blocks.\n- If no skeletons are found, discuss alternative strategies with Agent2 and Agent3, such as exploring different areas or looking for other resources.\n\n### Summary of Next Steps:\n- **Begin the Search**: Move to different locations to search for skeletons and gather materials.\n- **Collect Bones**: If skeletons are found, defeat them and collect any bones dropped.\n- **Stay in Touch**: Keep communication open with Agent2 and Agent3 to coordinate efforts and share any discoveries.\n\nBy following this plan, Agent1 can maximize their chances of obtaining the necessary materials to proceed with the building task according to the blueprint.", "agent2": "Given the current situation where Agent2 has thoroughly searched for bone blocks without success, communicated with Agent1 about the lack of resources, and confirmed that there are no skeletons nearby, the next tasks for Agent2 should be as follows:\n\n1. **Explore New Areas**: Since the immediate vicinity has been searched, Agent2 should consider exploring new biomes or areas further away from their current location. This could involve:\n   - Traveling to different biomes where skeletons might spawn, especially at night.\n   - Looking for structures like dungeons, temples, or villages that might contain bone blocks.\n\n2. **Coordinate with Agent3**: Agent2 should reach out to Agent3 to see if they have any additional insights or have found any bone blocks during their search. Collaboration can help maximize their chances of finding the necessary materials.\n\n3. **Document Findings**: As Agent2 explores, they should document any findings or observations that could be useful for the construction project. This includes noting the locations of any potential resources or obstacles encountered during the search.\n\n4. **Plan for Auxiliary Blocks**: While searching for bone blocks, Agent2 can continue planning the placement of auxiliary blocks for any target blocks that need to be suspended in the air. This involves identifying which blocks will require support and where those auxiliary blocks should be placed.\n\n5. **Consider Crafting Options**: If Agent2 has access to bones from other sources (like crafting from bone meal or other items), they should consider crafting bone blocks if possible.\n\nIn summary, the immediate next task for Agent2 is to actively explore new areas for bone blocks while coordinating with Agent3 and planning for auxiliary block placements.", "agent3": "Given the current situation where agent3 has navigated to the coordinates (-6, -59, -3) and has not found any skeletons or bone blocks in the nearby area, the next task for agent3 should be to continue exploring the environment for alternative sources of bones or bone blocks. Here are the specific steps agent3 can take:\n\n1. **Explore Nearby Caves**: Since agent3 is already in the vicinity, they should look for any nearby caves or openings that may lead to areas where skeletons could spawn.\n\n2. **Check for Dungeons or Temples**: If agent3 is aware of any nearby dungeons or temples, they should head towards those locations, as these often contain skeletons or chests with bone blocks.\n\n3. **Look for Other Hostile Mobs**: While searching, agent3 should remain vigilant for other hostile mobs that might drop bones, such as wither skeletons or zombies.\n\n4. **Communicate with Team Members**: If agent3 has not done so recently, they should check in with agent2 to see if they have made any progress in their search for bones or bone blocks.\n\n5. **Reassess Inventory**: Agent3 should also check their inventory to see if they have any bones that could be used for crafting bone blocks.\n\n6. **Stay Safe**: While exploring, agent3 should be cautious of other hostile mobs and ensure their safety.\n\nIn summary, agent3's immediate task is to **continue exploring the environment for skeletons, dungeons, or temples that may contain bones or bone blocks**."}, "task_results": [{"agent1": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"message\": \"move failed, can not reach position -1 -44 -2, the position is blocked, check the environment\", \"status\": false}"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:Given the current situation, here are the immediate steps I will take as Agent2:\n\n1. **Explore New Areas**: Since I have already searched the immediate vicinity for bone blocks and skeletons without success, I will attempt to navigate to a new area.
