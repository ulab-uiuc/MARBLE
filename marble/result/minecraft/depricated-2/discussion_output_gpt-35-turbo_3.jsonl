You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6.

The minecraft world x,z is the horizontal coordinate, y is the vertical coordinate. y=-61 is the ground level.\n2. You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest.
