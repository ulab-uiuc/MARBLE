The result of the scanNearbyEntities task indicates that there is a block next to the position [-14, -60, -4].\n3.

The next task in the blueprint is to place a block of smooth sandstone at position [-14, -60, -4] facing direction A.\n\nThe next task can be represented as:\n\n`placeBlock(material: smooth_sandstone, position: [-14, -60, -4], facing: A)`\n\nThis task should be executed to place the smooth sandstone block at position [-14, -60, -4] facing direction A.\n\nThe agent's memory should be updated to reflect the current task and the progress made so far.\n\nHere's an example of how the agent's memory could be updated:\n\n```\nmemory: {\n  current_task: \"placeBlock(material: smooth_sandstone, position: [-14, -60, -4], facing: A)\",\n  progress: {\n    tasks_completed: 2,\n    tasks_in_progress: 1,\n    tasks_pending: 8\n  },\n  inventory: {\n    smooth_sandstone: 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `inventory` section of the agent's memory has been updated to reflect the number of smooth sandstone blocks available, which is now 0 since the agent has used up the block.\n\nHowever, before executing the `placeBlock` task, the agent should also check if the position [-14, -60, -4] is already occupied by another block.\n\nSo, the next task can be represented as:\n\n`checkBlock(position: [-14, -60, -4])`\n\nThis task should be executed to check if the position [-14, -60, -4] is already occupied by another block.
