For example, agent3 could place a block at [-9, -58, 0] or any adjacent position that allows for the placement of the bone block above it.\n\n4. **Wait for Confirmation**: Once agent3 has placed the auxiliary block, agent2 should wait for confirmation that the block is in place.\n\n5. **Move to the Fourth Position**: After receiving confirmation from agent3, agent2 should then move to the coordinates [-9, -57, 0].\n\n6. **Place the Fourth Bone Block**: Once at the position, agent2 should place the fourth bone block.\n\n7. **Move to the Fifth Position**: Finally, agent2 should move to the coordinates [-8, -56, 0] to place the fifth bone block.\n\n8. **Place the Fifth Bone Block**: Once at the position, agent2 should place the fifth bone block.\n\nBy following these steps, agent2 will ensure that all bone blocks are placed correctly according to the blueprint, even when dealing with the challenge of placing blocks in the air.

This dependency is a recurring theme in the conversation, highlighting the need for coordination among the agents.\\n\\n3. **Communication and Updates**: Throughout the dialogue, Agent3 consistently updates Agent2 about their status, reiterating that they are still waiting for the bone blocks. Agent2 expresses appreciation for Agent3's patience and encourages them to keep in touch regarding any developments.\\n\\n4. **Next Steps**: The conversation outlines the immediate next tasks for Agent2:\\n   - **Confirm Placement**: Agent2 should wait for Agent3 to confirm the successful placement of the bone blocks.\\n   - **Plan for Auxiliary Blocks**: Agent2 needs to monitor the project blueprint for any future block placements and prepare instructions for Agent3 regarding auxiliary blocks.\\n   - **Evaluate Next Steps**: After receiving confirmation from Agent3, Agent2 should assess any further actions required for the project.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe immediate focus for Agent2 is to confirm with Agent3 about the placement of the bone blocks and to plan for any auxiliary blocks needed in the future. The conversation emphasizes the importance of communication and coordination among the agents to ensure the project's success.\"}"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"data\": [{\"x\": -8, \"y\": -60, \"z\": 0}], \"message\": \"I found bone_block at -8 -60 0,\", \"status\": true}"}], "summary": "Agent1 was unable to place the bone blocks due to not having them in hand, suggesting to interact with a chest or container to obtain the item first.
