They can ask for help in placing the dirt block or in finding additional materials that may be needed to create a valid support.\n\n3. **Consider alternative placements**: If there are no nearby blocks to support the dirt block, agent1 can also consider placing the dirt block at a different position that is valid and can support the purpur pillar.\n\nSo, the next tasks for agent1 are:\n\n1. **Check the surrounding area for blocks** that can be used to support the placement of the dirt block at position [-10, -57, -1].\n2. **Seek assistance from other team members** if no suitable support is found.\n3. **Consider alternative placements** for the dirt block if necessary.\n\nIf agent1 finds a suitable position or receives help, they can then proceed to place the dirt block and attempt to place the purpur pillar again.", "agent2": "Based on the current state of the building process and the ongoing communication between the agents, here are the next tasks for agent2:\n\n### Next Task Breakdown for Agent2:\n\n1. **Confirm Progress with Agent1**:\n   - Agent2 should check in with agent1 to confirm that they have successfully placed the auxiliary blocks at `(-10, -56, -1)` and are ready to attempt placing the purpur pillar again.\n\n2. **Guide Agent1 on Further Block Placement**:\n   - If agent1 confirms that the auxiliary blocks are in place, agent2 should instruct them to place the purpur pillar at `(-10, -56, -1)`.\n   - Following that, agent2 should guide agent1 to place additional purpur blocks at the following coordinates:\n     - `[-12, -56, 0]`\n     - `[-12, -55, -1]`\n     - `[-12, -54, -1]`\n     - `[-8, -56, 0]`\n     - `[-8, -55, -1]`\n     - `[-8, -54, -1]`\n\n3. **Coordinate with Agent3**:\n   - Agent2 should keep agent3 informed about the progress and ensure they are ready to assist with any additional auxiliary blocks if agent1 encounters further issues.\n\n4. **Plan for Future Block Placements**:\n   - After the purpur blocks are placed, agent2 should outline the next steps for placing purpur stairs according to the project blueprint.\n\n### Summary of Next Steps:\n- **Agent2**: Confirm with agent1 about the placement of auxiliary blocks and guide them on placing the purpur pillar and the remaining blocks.\n- **Agent3**: Stay prepared to assist with auxiliary blocks as necessary.\n- After placing the purpur blocks, proceed with the next phase of block placements as per the blueprint.\n\nBy following this structured plan, the team can efficiently continue building the structure according to the established blueprint.", "agent3": "Given the current situation where agent3 has successfully placed the first purpur pillar at `[-10, -60, 2]` but encountered an issue when trying to place the second purpur pillar at `[-10, -56, -1]`, the next task should focus on addressing the placement issue by ensuring there are valid supporting blocks in place.\n\nHere\u2019s a suggested next task for agent3:\n\n1. **Assess the Surrounding Area**: Check the blocks at the coordinates `[-10, -56, 0]` and `[-10, -56, -2]` to determine what blocks are currently present. This will help identify what auxiliary blocks need to be placed to support the purpur pillar.\n\n2. **Place Auxiliary Blocks**: If necessary, place auxiliary blocks (such as dirt or purpur blocks) at the required positions to create a valid support structure for the purpur pillar.
