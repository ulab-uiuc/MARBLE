You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6.

The first set of blocks to place are the ones at positions `[-12, -60, -2]` to `[-10, -60, -2]`, and so on, as specified in the blueprint.\n\n4. **Design Auxiliary Blocks**: If any blocks need to be placed in the air, agent2 should design and communicate the placement of auxiliary blocks to support those target blocks.\n\n### Next Task:\n- **Communicate with Agent1**: Tell agent1 to start placing the smooth sandstone blocks in the following order:\n  - Place blocks at positions `[-12, -60, -2]`, `[-12, -60, -1]`, `[-12, -60, 0]`, `[-12, -60, 1]`, and `[-11, -60, 2]`.\n  \n- **Instruct Agent3**: If any blocks need to be placed in the air, inform agent3 when to place auxiliary blocks to support those placements.\n\nBy following these steps, agent2 will effectively contribute to the building process while ensuring that the blocks are placed correctly according to the blueprint.", "agent3": "Based on the task history and the current situation, agent3 needs to prioritize obtaining the necessary item (smooth_sandstone) before they can proceed with placing any blocks.

The minecraft world x,z is the horizontal coordinate, y is the vertical coordinate. y=-61 is the ground level.\n2. You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest.

If their is no items in the chest, maybe you can find the item at other chest or get it from other agent or dig it up or craft it.\n7. One bucket can hold one item, if you want to get more items, you need to get more buckets at first.\n8.
