Agent2 mentions that auxiliary blocks will be needed to support blocks that need to be placed in the air and will inform agent3 when to place and remove these blocks.\\n\\n**Relevant Information from the Minecraft Knowledge Card**\\n\\n1. The Minecraft world uses x, z as horizontal coordinates and y as the vertical coordinate, with y=-61 being the ground level.\\n2.

The blueprint contains information about the material, facing direction, and position of each block. Agent1 is skilled at finding correct materials in the container and placing blocks in the correct position.\n\nGiven that the blueprint is for building a structure using bone blocks, the first step would be to ensure that agent1 has access to the necessary materials (bone blocks). \n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to determine the next task:\n\n1. **Check Availability of Materials**: Agent1 should first check if there are enough bone blocks available in the chest or in their inventory. If not, they should seek help from other team members or explore other chests to find the required materials.\n\n2. **Identify the First Block to Place**: Looking at the blueprint, the first few entries describe blocks to be placed at positions starting from y=-60 (ground level) and moving upwards. Since blocks cannot be placed in the air without any support, it's logical to start with the blocks at or near the ground level.\n\n3. **Choose a Task**: Given the constraints and the agent's skills, a suitable next task could be to place a bone block at one of the specified ground-level positions if the material is available. If the material is not available, the task should be to retrieve the necessary bone blocks.\n\n4. **Specific Task Based on Blueprint**: Considering the blueprint's first entry is for bone blocks facing x at positions [-12, -60, 0] to [-10, -60, 0], a specific task for agent1 could be to place a bone block at position [-12, -60, 0] if the block is not already there and if agent1 has a bone block in their inventory.\n\n5. **Action**: The action would involve using the 'placeBlock' command to place the bone block at the specified position. Before that, if the bone block is not in the inventory, agent1 would need to use the 'withdrawItem' command to retrieve a bone block from a chest or seek assistance from other agents.\n\nTherefore, the next task for agent1, assuming they have the necessary bone block in their inventory, could be to place a bone block at position [-12, -60, 0] facing x, using the 'placeBlock' command. If the bone block is not available, the next task would be to retrieve a bone block using 'withdrawItem' or by seeking help from other team members.", "agent2": "Based on the conversation and task history, the next task should be for agent1 to place the initial blocks at the specified positions, which are:\n\n* Positions [-12 -60 0] to [-10 -60 0]\n* Positions [-12 -60 1] to [-10 -60 1]\n* Positions [-13 -60 -1] to [-9 -60 -1]\n\nAgent1 should find the necessary bone block materials and place them in the correct positions according to the blueprint.\n\nMeanwhile, agent2 should review the blueprint and identify the blocks that will be placed in the air, and inform agent3 when to place and remove auxiliary blocks to support those blocks.\n\nThe team should continue to follow the blueprint and work together to complete the structure, ensuring that all blocks are placed according to the specified material, facing direction, and position.", "agent3": "Based on the provided information, agent3's role is to place auxiliary blocks and remove them according to the discussion with agent2.
