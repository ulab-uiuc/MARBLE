Agent 2 provides the correct order, which is a list of 40 positions.\\n4. Agent 3 confirms the correct order, but there is a discrepancy in the chat history where Agent 3 and Agent 2 exchange the same information multiple times.\\n\\n**Relevant Information from the Minecraft Knowledge Card:**\\n\\n1. The Minecraft world uses x, z coordinates for horizontal positions and y for vertical positions.\\n2. Blocks cannot be directly placed in the air; there must be at least one existing block next to it.\\n3. Blocks can exist in the air by removing all other blocks attached to it.\\n4. Items in chests cannot be directly seen or used; they need to be taken out and used or equipped.\\n5. Agents are in a team and should not change blocks placed by other agents without permission.\\n\\n**Blueprint Information:**\\n\\nThe blueprint contains 12 sections, each describing a specific material, facing direction, and position of blocks. The materials include gravel, magma_block, structure_block, stone_bricks, and mossy_cobblestone.\\n\\n**Action Items:**\\n\\n1. Agent 3 should place the auxiliary blocks at the specified positions in the correct order.\\n2. Agents should work together to build the building according to the blueprint.\\n3.
