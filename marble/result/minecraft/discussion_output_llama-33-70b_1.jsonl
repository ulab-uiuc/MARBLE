Agent2 offered continued support, advising agent1 to use the 'placeBlock' function to place the dirt_path block at position [-8, -60, 1] once the material was obtained.\\n\\n**Key Points and Decisions**\\n\\n1. **Container Location**: The container was found near the navigation point [-10, -60, 1], as suggested by agent2.\\n2. **Retrieving Material**: Agent1 used the 'withdrawItem' function to retrieve the dirt_path material from the container.\\n3. **Next Steps**: Agent1 is to use the 'placeBlock' function to place the dirt_path block at position [-8, -60, 1].\\n\\n**Action Plan and Outcome**\\n\\nThe initial action plan for agent1, which involved seeking help from agent2 to find the container and then retrieve the dirt_path material, was successfully executed. With the container located and the material retrieved, agent1 is now poised to complete the next task by placing the dirt_path block as planned. The successful communication and coordination between agent1 and agent2 have ensured the progression of the building project according to the blueprint.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe chat history indicates a successful collaboration between agent1 and agent2, leading to the location of the container and the retrieval of the dirt_path material. Agent1 is now ready to proceed with placing the dirt_path block, marking a significant step forward in the project. The effective use of the 'new_communication_session' function and the supportive interaction between the agents have been crucial in overcoming the initial hurdle of finding the container, demonstrating the importance of teamwork and communication in achieving project goals.\"}"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session 19c72ee3-aa14-4b60-b84a-ff523dd341b0\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session 19c72ee3-aa14-4b60-b84a-ff523dd341b0 \\nFrom agent2 to agent1: Place the dirt_path block at position [-8, -60, 1] first, then place the dirt block at position [-8, -60, 0], then place the dirt_path block at position [-9, -60, -1], then place the dirt block at position [-10, -60, 2], then place the dirt_path block at position [-11, -60, 1], and finally place the dirt_path block at position [-11, -60, 2].\\nFrom agent1 to agent2: I have received your instructions.

You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6. If their is no items in the chest, maybe you can find the item at other chest or get it from other agent or dig it up or craft it.\n7. One bucket can hold one item, if you want to get more items, you need to get more buckets at first.\n8.

The key points from the conversation are:\\n\\n1. **Initial Instruction**: Agent2 instructed agent1 to place a dirt block at position (-8, -60, 0).\\n2. **Agent1's Response**: Agent1 had already placed blocks at positions [-10, -60, 1], [-9, -60, 1], [-9, -60, 0], and [-10, -60, 0] before placing the dirt block at (-8, -60, 0) as instructed.\\n3. **Subsequent Instructions**: Agent2 then instructed agent1 to place dirt blocks at positions (-10, -60, 2) and (-8, -60, 1), which agent1 completed.\\n\\n**Task Analysis and Next Steps**\\n\\nBased on the task history and the provided blueprint, the next task for agent2 is to instruct agent1 to place the next block according to the blueprint. However, the blueprint indicates that the next block should be placed at positions [[-8 -60 0] [-10 -60 2]], but agent1 has already placed blocks at these positions.\\n\\nGiven the current state, it seems that agent2's next instruction should be to place a new block, but the provided blueprint and action function calls suggest instructing agent1 to place a dirt block at position (-8, -60, 0), which has already been done.\\n\\nTo proceed, agent2 should analyze the blueprint and determine the next tasks to complete the building, taking into account the blocks already placed by agent1. The correct next step would be to identify the next position in the blueprint that requires a block to be placed and instruct agent1 accordingly.\\n\\n**Recommended Next Action**\\n\\nThe recommended next action for agent2 is to review the blueprint, identify the next required block position, and instruct agent1 to place the corresponding block.

You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6.

Since breaking trees to get planks would require an axe, which in turn needs a crafting table, we should focus on finding another way to get the wooden planks first. Once you have the wooden planks, you can build a crafting table and then craft the necessary tool to remove the stone_bricks at position (-11, -60, 0). After removing the stone_bricks, you can place the block at position (-11, -60, 0) following the established order: 1. Place the auxiliary block at position (-10, -61, -2). 2. Place the block at position (-10, -60, -2). 3. Place the block at position (-11, -60, 0), after removing the stone_bricks.\nFrom agent1 to agent2: I will try to find another source for the wooden planks. Can you please remind me of the established order for placing the blocks after I obtain the necessary tool to remove the stone_bricks at position (-11, -60, 0)?\nFrom agent2 to agent1: The established order for placing the blocks after removing the stone_bricks at position (-11, -60, 0) is: 1.

Can you tell me the correct order of placing the blocks?\\nFrom agent2 to agent1: To place the blocks according to the blueprint, we need to start with the blocks at the lowest y-coordinate. We have two types of materials: dirt_path and dirt. The dirt_path blocks have positions with y-coordinate -60, and the dirt blocks have positions with y-coordinates -62, -60, and -58. Since a block cannot be directly placed in the air, we need to place the blocks in a way that ensures there is at least one existing block next to each new block. Let's start by placing the dirt_path blocks, and then we can add the dirt blocks. I'll guide you through the correct order.\\nFrom agent1 to agent2: That sounds like a good plan. What is the first block I should place and where should I place it?\\nFrom agent2 to agent1: The first block you should place is a dirt_path block at position [-12, -60, -1].

The blueprint contains information about the material, facing direction, and position of each block. The agents are discussing the correct order of placing the blocks.\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n\\n1. The blueprint includes two types of materials: dirt_path and dirt.\\n2. The dirt_path blocks have positions with a y-coordinate of -60, while the dirt blocks have positions with y-coordinates of -62, -60, and -58.\\n3. To place the blocks, the agents need to start with the blocks at the lowest y-coordinate and ensure that each new block has at least one existing block next to it.\\n4. The first block to be placed is a dirt_path block at position [-12, -60, -1].\\n5. However, agent1 points out that this position is in the air because the ground level is at y=-61, making it impossible to place the block directly.\\n\\n**Relevant Minecraft Knowledge:**\\n\\n1. In Minecraft, the world's coordinates are x (horizontal), z (horizontal), and y (vertical), with y=-61 being the ground level.\\n2. A block cannot be placed directly in the air; it must have at least one existing block next to it.\\n3. Blocks can exist in the air if all attached blocks are removed.\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n\\nTo proceed with building the structure, the agents need to resolve the issue of placing the first dirt_path block at position [-12, -60, -1]. Possible solutions include:\\n\\n1. Adjusting the position of the first block to a location with existing blocks nearby.\\n2. Creating a foundation or base at the ground level (y=-61) to support the placement of the dirt_path block.\\n3.
