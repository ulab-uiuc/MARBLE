Therefore, we need to explore different locations or mine in specific areas where bone blocks are commonly found to acquire the necessary materials for the structure.\n\nHere are the suggested steps to proceed with the task:\n\n1. **Explore Different Locations:** Search the surrounding areas more thoroughly to see if there are any bone blocks nearby. Move around and scan for bone blocks in a wider radius to increase the chances of finding them.\n\n2. **Mining for Bone Blocks:** Consider mining in specific areas where bone blocks are commonly found. Look for underground caves, mineshafts, or areas with fossil structures as they are potential locations for bone blocks.\n\n3. **Collaboration and Strategy:** Collaborate with Agent1 to strategize on the best approach to acquire the bone blocks. Discuss possible locations to explore and mining techniques to efficiently gather the necessary materials.\n\n4. **Progress Updates:** Keep Agent1 informed of any progress made in locating the bone blocks. Share updates on the search efforts and any new ideas that arise during the exploration.\n\nBy following these steps and working together with Agent1, we can increase the chances of successfully obtaining the bone blocks needed for building the structure.
