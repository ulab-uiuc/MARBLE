You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6.

The blueprint contains necessary information about the material, facing direction and position of each block.\n*** The minecraft knowledge card ***\nHere are some knowledge about minecraft:\n1. The minecraft world x,z is the horizontal coordinate, y is the vertical coordinate. y=-61 is the ground level.\n2. You can use the tool or empty hand to dig the block, and place the block to the world.\n3. A block cannot be directly placed in the air. When being placed, there must be at least one existing block next to it.\n4. A block can exist in the air by removing all the other blocks attached to it.\n5. You can find the item in the chest. Item in the chest can not directly be seen or used, take it out and use it or equip it.\n6. If their is no items in the chest, maybe you can find the item at other chest or get it from other agent or dig it up or craft it.\n7. One bucket can hold one item, if you want to get more items, you need to get more buckets at first.\n8. You are in a team with other agents, you can try to find the item from other agents, and do not change the blocks other agents placed without permission.\n*** The blueprint ***\n[\n
