I will place the auxiliary block and then the target block. After that, I will remove the auxiliary block if it's not part of the final structure.

Agent3 confirms that the chest contains no tools, suggesting that agent2 should craft a tool using a crafting table.\\n\\n**Key Points and Decisions**\\n\\n1. **Tool Acquisition**: Agent2 needs to obtain a tool (specifically a pickaxe) to dig the block at position [-11, -61, 0].\\n2. **Tool Location**: The tool can be found in a chest or crafted using a crafting table.\\n3. **Current Status**: Agent2 is attempting to craft a tool after failing to find one in the chest.\\n4. **Next Steps**: After obtaining the tool, agent2 will inform agent3 of the updated plan and proceed with digging the block, designing auxiliary blocks if necessary, and coordinating with agent1 and agent3 for further actions.\\n\\n**Recommended Actions**\\n\\n1. **Craft a Tool**: Agent2 should attempt to craft a pickaxe using a crafting table, which can be represented by the action:\\n   ```\\n   {\\\"type\\\": \\\"action_function_call\\\", \\\"action_name\\\": \\\"craftTool\\\", \\\"args\\\": {\\\"tool_type\\\": \\\"pickaxe\\\", \\\"player_name\\\": \\\"agent2\\\"}}\\n   ```\\n2. **Dig the Block**: After obtaining the tool, agent2 should dig the block at position [-11, -61, 0] using the action:\\n   ```\\n   {\\\"type\\\": \\\"action_function_call\\\", \\\"action_name\\\": \\\"dig\\\", \\\"args\\\": {\\\"x\\\": -11, \\\"y\\\": -61, \\\"z\\\": 0, \\\"player_name\\\": \\\"agent2\\\"}}\\n   ```\\n3. **Design Auxiliary Blocks and Coordinate with Agents**: Depending on the blueprint and the need for auxiliary blocks to support placing blocks in the air, agent2 should design these blocks and inform agent1 and agent3 of the correct order of placing target blocks and when to put and remove auxiliary blocks.\\n\\n**Outcome and Future Actions**\\n\\nThe successful crafting of a tool and subsequent digging of the block will allow agent2 to proceed with the task, ensuring progress in the Minecraft environment.

Can you tell me the correct order of placing the blocks?\\nFrom agent2 to agent1: To determine the correct order of placing the blocks, we need to analyze the blueprint and consider the constraints of the Minecraft world. Since a block cannot be directly placed in the air, we need to start with the blocks that are closest to the ground level (y=-61). Let's begin with the blocks at position [-10, -60, 0], [-9, -60, 0], and [-8, -60, 0]. These blocks should be placed first, followed by the blocks at position [-10, -60, 1], [-9, -60, 1], and [-8, -60, 1]. Next, we can place the blocks at position [-10, -60, 2] and [-11, -60, 1], and finally, the block at position [-11, -60, 2]. We also need to consider the auxiliary blocks that may be required to support the blocks in the air. I'll guide you through the process, and we can work together to build the structure according to the blueprint.\\nFrom agent1 to agent2: I understand that we need to start with the blocks closest to the ground level. Can you please confirm the order of placing the blocks at positions [-10, -60, 0], [-9, -60, 0], and [-8, -60, 0], and then the blocks at positions [-10, -60, 1], [-9, -60, 1], and [-8, -60, 1]?\\nFrom agent2 to agent1: Yes, I confirm that we should start with the blocks closest to the ground level. The correct order for the blocks at positions [-10, -60, 0], [-9, -60, 0], and [-8, -60, 0] is to place the block at [-10, -60, 0] first, then the block at [-9, -60, 0], and finally the block at [-8, -60, 0]. After that, we can place the blocks at positions [-10, -60, 1], [-9, -60, 1], and [-8, -60, 1] in the same order from left to right.\\nFrom agent1 to agent2: Yes, I confirm that we should start with the blocks closest to the ground level. The correct order for the blocks at positions [-10, -60, 0], [-9, -60, 0], and [-8, -60, 0] is to place the block at [-10, -60, 0] first, then the block at [-9, -60, 0], and finally the block at [-8, -60, 0].

This involves resolving the placement issues discussed in the chat history, potentially through collaborative problem-solving with agent1 regarding support blocks. By following these steps, agent3 can efficiently complete the task and fulfill their role in the team. \\n\\n**Recommendation for User:**\\n\\nTo proceed, it would be beneficial to break the loop in the conversation by having agent3 send a new message to agent1 that directly addresses the next steps for transferring the bone blocks and collaborating on the placement issue.

Agent2 then mentions designing auxiliary blocks for support and plans to instruct agent3 to place them but doesn't follow through with new instructions for agent1.\\n\\n**Key Themes and Issues**\\n\\n1. **Block Placement Issue**: The primary issue is the inability to place the block at the specified position due to the absence of a reference block or the height being too great.\\n2. **Lack of Progression**: Despite agent2's mention of designing auxiliary blocks, there's no progression in resolving the initial block placement issue for agent1.\\n3. **Repetition**: Agent2 repeats the initial instruction without addressing the issue agent1 faced, leading to a loop in the conversation.\\n\\n**Next Task for Agent2**\\n\\nGiven the context and the task at hand, the next logical step for agent2 should indeed focus on establishing a foundation that can support the subsequent placement of blocks. The suggested action involves instructing agent1 to place a block that serves as the foundation, which is in contact with the ground, thereby addressing the initial issue of lack of support or reference for the block placement.\\n\\n**Recommended Action for Agent2**\\n\\nThe recommended next action for agent2, as per the task analysis, is to instruct agent1 to place the first block with the position [start:[-9 -60 0] end:[-9 -58 0]], which is the foundation of the building and is in contact with the ground.
