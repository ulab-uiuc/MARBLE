BudgetSync is a web-based application that allows a group of users, such as family members or roommates, to collectively manage their finances. The application provides a shared dashboard for tracking income, expenses, and budget goals, and it supports real-time updates and notifications to keep all users informed and engaged in the budgeting process.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - BudgetSync must allow multiple users to sign up and log in, with each user having a unique profile that includes personal financial data and permissions to access shared budgets.\n   - The application should provide a shared dashboard where users can input and categorize their income and expenses. The dashboard should display real-time updates of the total budget, spending breakdowns, and progress towards budget goals.\n   - BudgetSync must support the creation of multiple shared budgets, each with its own set of goals and categories. Users should be able to invite others to join a budget and assign different levels of access (e.g., view-only, edit).\n   - The application should include adaptive features that adjust based on user feedback and financial data. For example, it should automatically suggest budget adjustments when spending exceeds a certain threshold or when income changes significantly.\n   - BudgetSync should provide visual representations of budget breakdowns, such as pie charts and bar graphs, to help users understand their financial patterns. Users should be able to customize these visualizations based on their preferences.\n   - The application must include a notification system that alerts users to important budget updates, such as when a budget goal is reached, when a spending limit is exceeded, or when a new user is added to a shared budget.\n   - BudgetSync should offer a feedback mechanism where users can provide input on the application's performance and suggest improvements.
