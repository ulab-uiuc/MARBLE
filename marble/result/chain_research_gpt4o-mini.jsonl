This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

Naive approaches may fail due to the lack of nuanced understanding of language and context, leading to suboptimal responses. Additionally, the existing datasets for instruction tuning may be limited in diversity and quality, making it difficult for models to generalize effectively.

We find that unlike MI explanations, gradient-based explanations have three desirable properties. First, they are actionable: selecting inputs depending on them results in predictable changes in similarity scores. Second, they are consistent: the effect of selecting certain inputs overlaps very little with the effect of discarding them. Third, they can be pruned significantly to obtain sparse explanations that retain the effect on similarity scores.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07639v1\", \"timestamp\": 1720617647, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent5", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"a9a05ab0-8f9a-4e52-ad20-0ff543473e75\", \"authors\": [\"Thorben Funke\", \"Megha Khosla\", \"Mandeep Rathee\", \"Avishek Anand\"], \"title\": \"Zorro: Valid, Sparse, and Stable Explanations in Graph Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"With the ever-increasing popularity and applications of graph neural networks, several proposals have been made to explain and understand the decisions of a graph neural network.

Since the explanation model for a static graph cannot be readily applied to temporal graphs due to its inability to capture temporal dependencies, recent studies proposed explanation models for temporal graphs. However, existing explanation models for temporal graphs rely on post-hoc explanations, requiring separate models for prediction and explanation, which is limited in two aspects: efficiency and accuracy of explanation. In this work, we propose a novel built-in explanation framework for temporal graphs, called Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). TGIB provides explanations for event occurrences by introducing stochasticity in each temporal event based on the Information Bottleneck theory.

In this work, we extend artificial simulatability studies to the domain of graph neural networks. Instead of costly human trials, we use explanation-supervisable graph neural networks to perform simulatability studies to quantify the inherent usefulness of attributional graph explanations.

The proposed graph unrolling networks expand algorithm unrolling to the graph domain and provide an interpretation of the architecture design from a signal processing perspective. We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two special cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC) and graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional denoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

By providing interpretable explanations alongside predictions, we can facilitate better collaboration between AI systems and human experts, leading to more informed decision-making. This research could pave the way for future advancements in explainable AI, particularly in complex domains where understanding model behavior is essential for ethical and effective use.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of GNNs, which utilize both node features and graph topology to make predictions. Traditional post-hoc explanation methods often fail to accurately represent the model's decision-making process, leading to biased or misleading interpretations. Additionally, developing a framework that integrates explanation generation with prediction in a seamless manner requires overcoming significant technical hurdles, such as ensuring computational efficiency and maintaining high prediction accuracy while providing meaningful explanations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on post-hoc explanation methods, which do not directly leverage the GNN's architecture for generating explanations. This has resulted in limitations such as lack of accuracy, inefficiency, and potential biases in the explanations provided. Moreover, existing approaches often do not consider the unique characteristics of graph data, which complicates the explanation process.

To tackle this issue, meta-learning has been proposed to transfer structural knowledge from base classes with abundant labels to target novel classes. However, existing solutions become ineffective or inapplicable when base classes have no or limited labeled nodes. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method dubbed Virtual Node Tuning (VNT). Our approach utilizes a pretrained graph transformer as the encoder and injects virtual nodes as soft prompts in the embedding space, which can be optimized with few-shot labels in novel classes to modulate node embeddings for each specific FSNC task. A unique feature of VNT is that, by incorporating a Graph-based Pseudo Prompt Evolution (GPPE) module, VNT-GPPE can handle scenarios with sparse labels in base classes. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in addressing FSNC with unlabeled or sparsely labeled base classes, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and even fully supervised baselines.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06063v1\", \"timestamp\": 1686332302, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"042b5b79-4bef-4c72-88a3-dc21785b55d7\", \"authors\": [\"Le Yu\", \"Leilei Sun\", \"Bowen Du\", \"Tongyu Zhu\", \"Weifeng Lv\"], \"title\": \"Label-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for Semi-supervised Node Classification\", \"abstract\": \"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the semi-supervised node classification task, where a key point lies in how to sufficiently leverage the limited but valuable label information. Most of the classical GNNs solely use the known labels for computing the classification loss at the output. In recent years, several methods have been designed to additionally utilize the labels at the input. One part of the methods augment the node features via concatenating or adding them with the one-hot encodings of labels, while other methods optimize the graph structure by assuming neighboring nodes tend to have the same label. To bring into full play the rich information of labels, in this paper, we present a label-enhanced learning framework for GNNs, which first models each label as a virtual center for intra-class nodes and then jointly learns the representations of both nodes and labels. Our approach could not only smooth the representations of nodes belonging to the same class, but also explicitly encode the label semantics into the learning process of GNNs.

By exploring the use of multiple virtual nodes, the study could lead to more robust models that enhance the understanding of latent graph features. This advancement could influence future research in graph neural networks and representation learning, potentially leading to better applications in fields such as bioinformatics, cybersecurity, and social network analysis.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in effectively managing the interactions between multiple virtual nodes and existing graph structures, as well as ensuring that the model can generalize well across different tasks. Naive approaches may fail to capture the intricate relationships within the graph, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the complexity of optimizing the representation of multiple virtual nodes while maintaining computational efficiency poses a significant technical hurdle.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single virtual nodes due to the simplicity of implementation and analysis. The lack of exploration into multiple virtual nodes may stem from the increased complexity in model design and the computational resources required. Existing solutions often overlook the potential benefits of capturing diverse latent features that multiple virtual nodes could provide. This research aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel framework that leverages multiple virtual nodes for enhanced graph representation.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves augmenting attributed graphs with multiple virtual nodes, each representing different latent aspects of the graph. The model will utilize a combination of graph neural networks and advanced optimization techniques to learn the representations of these virtual nodes. The experiments will be conducted on benchmark datasets, including bioactivity prediction and software vulnerability detection tasks, using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and F1-score.

To further advance our\nunderstanding of the operating mechanisms of such ion-\nconducting devices, atomic-scale analyses of ionic motion\nin device operating circumstances, that is, under electric\nfields, are crucial.\nAssuming a linear response, external forces arising\nfrom applied electric fields can be estimated simply by\nmultiplying the electric field vector by the valence states\nof the ions.

It is shown how the different ionic radii of the cationic substitutions influence structural characteristics such as the octahedron volumes around Li ions on the initial and transition state sites, which affect the activation energies (''composition-structure-property'' relationships). The prevalent assumption that structural bottlenecks formed by triangularly arranged oxygen atoms at a certain location along the migration path determine the energy barriers for Li migration is not supported by the DFT results.

This research could lead to the discovery of new materials with enhanced performance, thereby advancing the field of energy storage technology. Additionally, insights gained could inform the design of next-generation batteries, impacting both academic research and commercial applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to simulate ionic motion at the atomic level under dynamic conditions, such as varying electric fields and temperatures. Traditional computational methods, like density functional theory (DFT), are computationally expensive and may not capture the full range of ionic behavior in real-world applications. Moreover, accurately modeling the interactions between ions and their surrounding environment presents significant theoretical challenges, as does the integration of machine learning techniques to predict material properties.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on static properties of materials or simplified models that do not account for the dynamic nature of ionic migration under operational conditions.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \nIntroduction\n\nImprovements in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education have accelerated the shift from teaching and assessing facts to developing students\u2019 conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills (NGSS 2013). To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

However, grading open-ended questions can be time-consuming leading teachers to resort to simpler question formats or conduct fewer formative assessments. While there has been a longstanding interest in automating of short-answer grading (ASAG), but previous approaches have been technically complex, limiting their use in formative assessment contexts. The newest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially makes grading short answer questions more feasible. This paper investigates the potential for the newest version of LLMs to be used in ASAG, specifically in the grading of short answer questions for formative assessments, in two ways. First, it introduces a novel dataset of short answer reading comprehension questions, drawn from a set of reading assessments conducted with over 150 students in Ghana. This dataset allows for the evaluation of LLMs in a new context, as they are predominantly designed and trained on data from high-income North American countries. Second, the paper empirically evaluates how well various configurations of generative LLMs grade student short answer responses compared to expert human raters. The findings show that GPT-4, with minimal prompt engineering, performed extremely well on grading the novel dataset (QWK 0.92, F1 0.89), reaching near parity with expert human raters. To our knowledge this work is the first to empirically evaluate the performance of generative LLMs on short answer reading comprehension questions using real student data, with low technical hurdles to attaining this performance.

Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages.   Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.   In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools' performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders.

Each analytic dimension is assessed on a 6-point scale, to provide detailed feedback to students that can help them improve their science writing skills.

A recently published dataset of two sets of college level lab reports from an inquiry-based physics curriculum relies on analytic assessment rubrics that utilize multiple dimensions, specifying subject matter knowledge and general components of good explanations. Each analytic dimension is assessed on a 6-point scale, to provide detailed feedback to students that can help them improve their science writing skills. Manual assessment can be slow, and difficult to calibrate for consistency across all students in large classes. While much work exists on automated assessment of open-ended questions in STEM subjects, there has been far less work on long-form writing such as lab reports. We present an end-to-end neural architecture that has separate verifier and assessment modules, inspired by approaches to Open Domain Question Answering (OpenQA). VerAs first verifies whether a report contains any content relevant to a given rubric dimension, and if so, assesses the relevant sentences. On the lab reports, VerAs outperforms multiple baselines based on OpenQA systems or Automated Essay Scoring (AES). VerAs also performs well on an analytic rubric for middle school physics essays.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05224v2\", \"timestamp\": 1707336129, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b8943905-562a-4a8f-b741-c5e0d693e332\", \"authors\": [\"Clayton Cohn\", \"Nicole Hutchins\", \"Tuan Le\", \"Gautam Biswas\"], \"title\": \"A Chain-of-Thought Prompting Approach with LLMs for Evaluating Students' Formative Assessment Responses in Science\", \"abstract\": \"This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to score and explain short-answer assessments in K-12 science.

We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation and evaluation techniques.   Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages.   Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.   In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools' performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders.   However, because the evaluation dataset is frequently unavailable, it is more difficult to reproduce results and compare tools to a collection of common assignments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11722v2\", \"timestamp\": 1687283690, \"domain\": \"cs.SE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"52e80bb9-feaa-4620-98c6-7964aa5f0b9a\", \"authors\": [\"Hunter McNichols\", \"Wanyong Feng\", \"Jaewook Lee\", \"Alexander Scarlatos\", \"Digory Smith\", \"Simon Woodhead\", \"Andrew Lan\"], \"title\": \"Automated Distractor and Feedback Generation for Math Multiple-choice Questions via In-context Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are ubiquitous in almost all levels of education since they are easy to administer, grade, and are a reliable form of assessment. An important aspect of MCQs is the distractors, i.e., incorrect options that are designed to target specific misconceptions or insufficient knowledge among students. To date, the task of crafting high-quality distractors has largely remained a labor-intensive process for teachers and learning content designers, which has limited scalability. In this work, we explore the task of automated distractor and corresponding feedback message generation in math MCQs using large language models. We establish a formulation of these two tasks and propose a simple, in-context learning-based solution. Moreover, we propose generative AI-based metrics for evaluating the quality of the feedback messages. We conduct extensive experiments on these tasks using a real-world MCQ dataset. Our findings suggest that there is a lot of room for improvement in automated distractor and feedback generation; based on these findings, we outline several directions for future work.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03234v2\", \"timestamp\": 1691370184, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the grading and feedback generation for formative assessments in K-12 STEM education, particularly in open-ended science questions?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the significant challenge teachers face in providing timely and meaningful feedback to students, which is essential for their learning and development in STEM subjects. Automating this process could enhance the efficiency of formative assessments, allowing teachers to focus more on instruction rather than grading. This research could lead to advancements in educational technology, improving student outcomes and engagement in STEM fields. Furthermore, it could pave the way for future studies on the integration of AI in educational practices, potentially transforming assessment methodologies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of this problem lies in the variability and open-ended nature of student responses in science assessments, which can differ widely in vocabulary, structure, and reasoning. Naive approaches may fail because they might not capture the nuances of student understanding or provide contextually relevant feedback. Additionally, the integration of LLMs requires careful prompt engineering and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability in grading, which can be technically challenging. There are also concerns regarding the interpretability of AI-generated feedback and its alignment with educational standards.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on more structured assessments or specific subjects, leaving a gap in automated grading for open-ended science questions. Existing solutions often lack the necessary adaptability to handle diverse student responses effectively. Barriers include the limited availability of high-quality datasets for training LLMs in educational contexts and the complexity of developing models that can provide meaningful feedback rather than just scores. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by employing a human-in-the-loop methodology that combines LLM capabilities with active learning techniques.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using GPT-4 for automated grading and feedback generation in middle school Earth Science assessments. We will develop a dataset of student responses to open-ended questions and utilize metrics such as Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance against expert human raters. The expected outcomes include a robust framework for automated assessment that not only scores student responses but also provides detailed, constructive feedback, thereby enhancing the learning experience and supporting teachers in their instructional roles.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 104152, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4, "agent4": 4, "agent5": 4, "agent6": 4}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

By leveraging such structure, we give two ways of computing strong sparsifications of poker games (as well as any other game with a similar structure) that are i) orders of magnitude faster to compute, ii) more numerically stable, and iii) produce a dramatically smaller number of nonzeros than the prior technique.

We argue that dynamic potential games, can effectively facilitate interactive decision-making in many multi-agent interactions. We will identify structures in realistic multi-agent interactive scenarios that can be transformed into weighted potential dynamic games.

The local gradient information of each player, essential in implementing algorithms for finding game solutions, is all too often unavailable. In this paper, we focus on designing solution algorithms for multi-player games using bandit feedback, i.e., the only available feedback at each player's disposal is the realized objective values. To tackle the issue of large variances in the existing bandit learning algorithms with a single oracle call, we propose two algorithms by integrating the residual feedback scheme into single-call extra-gradient methods. Subsequently, we show that the actual sequences of play can converge almost surely to a critical point if the game is pseudo-monotone plus and characterize the convergence rate to the critical point when the game is strongly pseudo-monotone. The ergodic convergence rates of the generated sequences in monotone games are also investigated as a supplement.

First, Player 1 selects one object from a sequence as in the secretary problem. All of the other objects are then presented to Player 2 in the same order as in the original sequence. The goal of both players is to select the best object. The optimal response of Player 2 is adapted to the optimal strategy in the secretary problem. This means that when Player 2 observes an object that is the best seen so far, it can be inferred whether Player 1 selected one of the earlier objects in the original sequence. However, Player 2 cannot compare the current object with the one selected by Player 1. Hence, this game defines an auxiliary problem in which Player 2 has incomplete information on the relative rank of an object. It is shown that the optimal strategy of Player 2 is based on both the number of objects to have appeared and the probability that the current object is better than the object chosen by Player 1 (if Player 1 chose an earlier object in the sequence). However, this probability is dependent on the previously observed objects. A lower bound on the optimal expected reward in the auxiliary problem is defined by limiting the memory of Player 2. An upper bound is derived by giving Player 2 additional information at appropriate times.

Addressing these issues can lead to more robust algorithms that can handle a wider range of real-world applications, such as resource allocation, financial modeling, and engineering design. A successful paper in this area could pave the way for future research on more complex optimization scenarios, enhancing the understanding of interior-point methods and their applications in various fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges include the mathematical complexities of formulating and solving unbounded and infeasible problems, as well as the computational difficulties associated with existing algorithms that may not converge or provide accurate solutions. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricacies of the problem structure, such as the presence of infinite solutions or constraints that lead to infeasibility. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative algorithmic strategies and a deep understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on bounded and feasible problems, leaving a gap in the literature regarding unbounded and infeasible cases. Existing solutions may not adequately address the unique challenges posed by these problems, such as the need for specialized embedding techniques or penalization strategies. Our approach aims to build on the foundational work in interior-point methods while introducing novel techniques that specifically target the issues of unboundedness and infeasibility, thus improving upon prior methodologies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a modified interior-point algorithm that incorporates advanced embedding techniques and adaptive penalization strategies to handle unbounded and infeasible problems. We will utilize a diverse set of benchmark optimization problems to evaluate the performance of our algorithm, measuring metrics such as convergence speed, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency. The expected outcomes include demonstrating the algorithm's ability to effectively solve previously challenging problems, providing insights into the behavior of interior-point methods in complex scenarios, and contributing to the broader field of numerical optimization.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 43704, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 5}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered.

Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead. Comprehensive evaluations show that Virtual Context-assisted jailbreak attacks can improve the success rates of four widely used jailbreak methods by approximately 40% across various LLMs. Additionally, applying Virtual Context to original malicious behaviors still achieves a notable jailbreak effect.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new task, knowledge-to-jailbreak, which aims to generate jailbreaks from domain knowledge to evaluate the safety of LLMs when applied to those domains.

Jailbreak, a form of attack that induces LLMs to output harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, poses a challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous jailbreak attack methods primarily exploited the internal capabilities of the model. Among them, one category leverages the model's implicit capabilities for jailbreak attacks, where the attacker is unaware of the exact reasons for the attack's success.

By understanding and improving jailbreak techniques, researchers can better anticipate potential vulnerabilities in LLMs, leading to the development of more robust safety measures. This research could advance knowledge in AI safety, inform policy-making regarding AI usage, and enhance the design of LLMs to prevent misuse in sensitive domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to navigate the intricate safety mechanisms embedded in LLMs, which are designed to prevent harmful outputs. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the model's ability to recognize and reject harmful prompts. Additionally, the challenge lies in crafting benign inputs that can subtly guide the model towards generating harmful content without triggering its safety filters. Technical obstacles include the need for extensive experimentation to identify effective patterns and the computational resources required for testing various input strategies.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-turn jailbreaks or methods that require significant model access, which limits their applicability to black-box models. Additionally, many existing studies have not explored the potential of multi-turn interactions or the use of benign inputs effectively. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive datasets for training and testing these techniques and insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern LLM responses. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by systematically exploring multi-turn interactions and leveraging benign inputs.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a multi-turn interaction framework, Crescendo, that utilizes benign prompts to guide LLMs towards harmful outputs. We will create a dataset of benign and harmful input pairs and evaluate the effectiveness of Crescendo against various state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models. Metrics for success will include the rate of successful jailbreaks and the ability to maintain the appearance of benign interactions.

However, existing algorithms primarily cater to human vision, while most point cloud data is utilized for machine vision tasks. To address this, we propose a point cloud compression framework that simultaneously handles both human and machine vision tasks. Our framework learns a scalable bit-stream, using only subsets for different machine vision tasks to save bit-rate, while employing the entire bit-stream for human vision tasks. Building on mainstream octree-based frameworks like VoxelContext-Net, OctAttention, and G-PCC, we introduce a new octree depth-level predictor. This predictor adaptively determines the optimal depth level for each octree constructed from a point cloud, controlling the bit-rate for machine vision tasks.

Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible local optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2. We partially follow the scaling rule proposed in the previous works\u00a0(Sun et\u00a0al., 2024; Tian et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\n\nModel\nParameters\n\nInter-Blocks N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N\n\n\nIntra-Blocks L\ud835\udc3fLitalic_L\n\n\nWidths w\ud835\udc64witalic_w\n\n\nHeads h\u210ehitalic_h\n\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-B\n343M\n24\n2\n1024\n16\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-L\n804M\n36\n3\n1280\n20\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-XL\n1.5B\n48\n4\n1536\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Method\n\n\n2.1 Overview\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2 is composed of two significant stages. One is a powerful visual tokenizer that maps the input visual signal into the discrete token representations. Subsequently, the vector-quantized sequence will be fed into the auto-regressive transformer for intra- and inter-token relationship modeling, eventually for visual synthesis.\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of Open-MAGVIT2.

Current approaches straightforwardly convert video into language tokens and employ large language models for multi-modal tasks.

To address this problem, we propose Vista-LLaMA, a novel framework that maintains the consistent distance between all visual tokens and any language tokens, irrespective of the generated text length. Vista-LLaMA omits relative position encoding when determining attention weights between visual and text tokens, retaining the position encoding for text and text tokens. This amplifies the effect of visual tokens on text generation, especially when the relative distance is longer between visual and text tokens. The proposed attention mechanism significantly reduces the chance of producing irrelevant text related to the video content.

Therefore, we are curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when the encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information? To this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack (Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple perspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature representations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties of visual tokens output by image encoders. Using only access to the image encoder in the proposed attack, the generated adversarial examples exhibit transferability across diverse LVLMs utilizing the same image encoder and generality across different tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superior attack performance of the VT-Attack over baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in attacking LVLMs with image encoders, which in turn can provide guidance on the robustness of LVLMs, particularly in terms of the stability of the visual feature space.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06699v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728464816, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"84c77598-7f89-419f-ace0-bbbda2177658\", \"authors\": [\"Chunjiang Ge\", \"Sijie Cheng\", \"Ziming Wang\", \"Jiale Yuan\", \"Yuan Gao\", \"Jun Song\", \"Shiji Song\", \"Gao Huang\", \"Bo Zheng\"], \"title\": \"ConvLLaVA: Hierarchical Backbones as Visual Encoder for Large Multimodal Models\", \"abstract\": \"High-resolution Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encounter the challenges of excessive visual tokens and quadratic visual complexity. Current high-resolution LMMs address the quadratic complexity while still generating excessive visual tokens. However, the redundancy in visual tokens is the key problem as it leads to more substantial compute. To mitigate this issue, we propose ConvLLaVA, which employs ConvNeXt, a hierarchical backbone, as the visual encoder of LMM to replace Vision Transformer (ViT). ConvLLaVA compresses high-resolution images into information-rich visual features, effectively preventing the generation of excessive visual tokens. To enhance the capabilities of ConvLLaVA, we propose two critical optimizations. Since the low-resolution pretrained ConvNeXt underperforms when directly applied on high resolution, we update it to bridge the gap. Moreover, since ConvNeXt's original compression ratio is inadequate for much higher resolution inputs, we train a successive stage to further compress the visual tokens, thereby reducing redundancy. These optimizations enable ConvLLaVA to support inputs of 1536x1536 resolution generating only 576 visual tokens, capable of handling images of arbitrary aspect ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on mainstream benchmarks.

Previous studies of audio-visual modalities primarily focused on either audio-visual representation learning or generative modeling of a modality conditioned on the other, creating a disconnect between these two branches. A unified framework that learns representation and generates modalities has not been developed yet. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called Vision to Audio and Beyond (VAB) to bridge the gap between audio-visual representation learning and vision-to-audio generation. The key approach of VAB is that rather than working with raw video frames and audio data, VAB performs representation learning and generative modeling within latent spaces. In particular, VAB uses a pre-trained audio tokenizer and an image encoder to obtain audio tokens and visual features, respectively. It then performs the pre-training task of visual-conditioned masked audio token prediction. This training strategy enables the model to engage in contextual learning and simultaneous video-to-audio generation. After the pre-training phase, VAB employs the iterative-decoding approach to rapidly generate audio tokens conditioned on visual features. Since VAB is a unified model, its backbone can be fine-tuned for various audio-visual downstream tasks.

Specifically, it takes as input a sequence of latent tokens to predict the visual tokens for synthesizing an image. Under this perspective, we propose a token-based generator (i.e.,TokenGAN).

Moreover, vanilla self-attention is heavily affected by useless information in images, severely constraining the potential of semantic priors in FSL due to the confusion of numerous irrelevant tokens during interaction. To address these aforementioned issues, a K-NN Transformer with Pyramid Prompts (KTPP) is proposed to select discriminative information with K-NN Context Attention (KCA) and adaptively modulate visual features with Pyramid Cross-modal Prompts (PCP). First, for each token, the KCA only selects the K most relevant tokens to compute the self-attention matrix and incorporates the mean of all tokens as the context prompt to provide the global context in three cascaded stages. As a result, irrelevant tokens can be progressively suppressed. Secondly, pyramid prompts are introduced in the PCP to emphasize visual features via interactions between text-based class-aware prompts and multi-scale visual features. This allows the ViT to dynamically adjust the importance weights of visual features based on rich semantic information at different scales, making models robust to spatial variations. Finally, augmented visual features and class-aware prompts are interacted via the KCA to extract class-specific features. Consequently, our model further enhances noise-free visual representations via deep cross-modal interactions, extracting generalized visual representation in scenarios with few labeled samples.

We conduct experiments for our proposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models, showing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual quality.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01699v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727885127, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"13783db7-4989-42b6-9c62-0e13c051d2c5\", \"authors\": [\"Zhuoyan Luo\", \"Fengyuan Shi\", \"Yixiao Ge\", \"Yujiu Yang\", \"Limin Wang\", \"Ying Shan\"], \"title\": \"Open-MAGVIT2: An Open-Source Project Toward Democratizing Auto-regressive Visual Generation\", \"abstract\": \"We present Open-MAGVIT2, a family of auto-regressive image generation models ranging from 300M to 1.5B.

While some attempts have been done, existing approaches typically treat them as separate tasks, failing to capture their interconnected nature. In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novel auto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and view prediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a single image and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging the gap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovative camera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of 2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in an auto-regressive manner. This unified training paradigm demonstrates that joint optimization of pose estimation and novel view synthesis leads to improved performance in both tasks, for the first time, highlighting the inherent relationship between spatial awareness and visual prediction.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18962v1\", \"timestamp\": 1729792685, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a5894636-4d7b-4d92-990c-0939c1f6cd63\", \"authors\": [\"Tianshuo Peng\", \"Zuchao Li\", \"Lefei Zhang\", \"Hai Zhao\", \"Ping Wang\", \"Bo Du\"], \"title\": \"Multi-modal Auto-regressive Modeling via Visual Words\", \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs), benefiting from the auto-regressive modelling approach performed on massive unannotated texts corpora, demonstrates powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities.

Current models struggle with visual generation quality compared to diffusion-based methods, primarily due to limitations in tokenizer performance. Addressing this issue could lead to significant advancements in the field, enabling the development of more efficient and high-quality visual generation systems. This research could pave the way for practical applications in various domains, including art generation, content creation, and virtual reality.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing tokenizer performance stem from the complexity of designing a tokenizer that can effectively handle a super-large codebook while maintaining high reconstruction quality. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate relationships between visual tokens and the need for sophisticated modeling techniques to capture these interactions. Additionally, the integration of a large vocabulary into auto-regressive models requires careful factorization and interaction strategies, which adds to the technical complexity.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by the availability of effective tokenizers and the closed-source nature of advanced models like MAGVIT-v2. Existing solutions often focus on either visual or textual modalities without adequately addressing the interplay between them. Our approach aims to fill this gap by providing an open-source replication of the advanced tokenizer and exploring its application in vanilla auto-regressive models, thus democratizing access to high-quality visual generation techniques.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves two main components: 1) the open-source replication of the Lookup-Free Quantizer from MAGVIT-v2, which will be evaluated on standard datasets like ImageNet to benchmark its performance; and 2) the integration of a super-large codebook into auto-regressive models through asymmetric token factorization and next sub-token prediction.

In contrast, data scientists typically collect as many features as possible into their datasets, and even engineer new features from existing ones.

Existing benchmarks for tabular feature selection consider classical downstream models, toy synthetic datasets, or do not evaluate feature selectors on the basis of downstream performance. Motivated by the increasing popularity of tabular deep learning, we construct a challenging feature selection benchmark evaluated on downstream neural networks including transformers, using real datasets and multiple methods for generating extraneous features.

Current frameworks for automated feature transformation rely on iterative sequence generation tasks, optimizing decision strategies through performance feedback from downstream tasks. However, these approaches fail to effectively utilize historical decision-making experiences and overlook potential relationships among generated features, thus limiting the depth of knowledge extraction. Moreover, the granularity of the decision-making process lacks dynamic backtracking capabilities for individual features, leading to insufficient adaptability when encountering inefficient pathways, adversely affecting overall robustness and exploration efficiency. To address the limitations observed in current automatic feature engineering frameworks, we introduce a novel method that utilizes a feature-state transformation graph to effectively preserve the entire feature transformation journey, where each node represents a specific transformation state. During exploration, three cascading agents iteratively select nodes and idea mathematical operations to generate new transformation states. This strategy leverages the inherent properties of the graph structure, allowing for the preservation and reuse of valuable transformations. It also enables backtracking capabilities through graph pruning techniques, which can rectify inefficient transformation paths. To validate the efficacy and flexibility of our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments and detailed case studies, demonstrating superior performance in diverse scenarios.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07404v1\", \"timestamp\": 1718122237, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a6d5a397-e242-43cd-839a-1623abb4d740\", \"authors\": [\"Meng Xiao\", \"Dongjie Wang\", \"Min Wu\", \"Ziyue Qiao\", \"Pengfei Wang\", \"Kunpeng Liu\", \"Yuanchun Zhou\", \"Yanjie Fu\"], \"title\": \"Traceable Automatic Feature Transformation via Cascading Actor-Critic Agents\", \"abstract\": \"Feature transformation for AI is an essential task to boost the effectiveness and interpretability of machine learning (ML).

A more effective automated feature transformation framework could significantly reduce the reliance on domain experts, streamline the data preparation process, and enhance model performance. This research could lead to practical applications in industries such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, where data-driven decision-making is essential. Furthermore, it could inspire future research on integrating historical knowledge into machine learning processes, potentially leading to more intelligent and adaptive systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of this problem arises from the high-dimensional nature of tabular data and the need to balance feature generation and selection effectively. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to capture the intricate relationships between features and the stochastic nature of existing methods, which can lead to inconsistent results. Additionally, the lack of dynamic backtracking capabilities in current frameworks limits their adaptability when encountering inefficient transformation pathways. Overcoming these challenges requires sophisticated algorithms that can learn from past transformations and make informed decisions about feature interactions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either empirical feature transformation methods or automated techniques that do not leverage historical decision-making effectively. Many existing frameworks lack the ability to represent complex situational states and do not integrate local and global feature information efficiently. Barriers such as the high dimensionality of data, the stochastic nature of feature generation, and the absence of robust backtracking mechanisms have hindered progress. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by utilizing a feature-state transformation graph that preserves the entire transformation journey, allowing for better decision-making and feature reuse.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a feature-state transformation graph where each node represents a specific transformation state.

One key idea behind SACPO, supported by theory, is that the optimal policy incorporating reward and safety can be directly obtained from a reward-aligned policy. Building on this key idea, SACPO aligns LLMs step-wise with each metric while leveraging simple yet powerful alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO). SACPO offers several advantages, including simplicity, stability, computational efficiency, and flexibility of algorithms and datasets.

In this paper, I assess whether we are on track to solve the alignment problem for large language models, and what that means for the safety of future AI systems. I argue that existing strategies for alignment are insufficient, because large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can reliably elicit unsafe behaviour. I offer an explanation of this lingering vulnerability on which it is not simply a contingent limitation of current language models, but has deep technical ties to a crucial aspect of what makes these models useful and versatile in the first place -- namely, their remarkable aptitude to learn \\\"in context\\\" directly from user instructions. It follows that the alignment problem is not only unsolved for current AI systems, but may be intrinsically difficult to solve without severely undermining their capabilities.

This article provides an up-to-date survey of recent trends in AI safety research of GAI-LLMs from a computer scientist's perspective: specific and technical. In this survey, we explore the background and motivation for the identified harms and risks in the context of LLMs being generative language models; our survey differentiates by emphasising the need for unified theories of the distinct safety challenges in the research development and applications of LLMs. We start our discussion with a concise introduction to the workings of LLMs, supported by relevant literature. Then we discuss earlier research that has pointed out the fundamental constraints of generative models, or lack of understanding thereof (e.g., performance and safety trade-offs as LLMs scale in number of parameters).

However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9\\\\% and 9.5\\\\% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against red-teaming attacks. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the advantage of AI feedback, particularly in fostering preference diversity to deliver more comprehensive improvements.

In this paper, we unveil a new vulnerability: the privacy backdoor attack. This black-box privacy attack aims to amplify the privacy leakage that arises when fine-tuning a model: when a victim fine-tunes a backdoored model, their training data will be leaked at a significantly higher rate than if they had fine-tuned a typical model. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and models, including both vision-language models (CLIP) and large language models, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of such an attack. Additionally, we carry out multiple ablation studies with different fine-tuning methods and inference strategies to thoroughly analyze this new threat.

We present a privacy proof that satisfies dx-privacy where the privacy parameter epsilon provides guarantees with respect to a distance metric defined by the word embedding space. We demonstrate how epsilon can be selected by analyzing plausible deniability statistics backed up by large scale analysis on GloVe and fastText embeddings. We conduct privacy audit experiments against 2 baseline models and utility experiments on 3 datasets to demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and utility for varying values of epsilon on different task types.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate personality traits, the relationship between personality traits and safety abilities in LLMs still remains a mystery. In this paper, we discover that LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities, i.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness, based on the reliable MBTI-M scale. Meanwhile, the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits. According to such findings, we can edit LLMs' personality traits and improve their safety performance, e.g., inducing personality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of approximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance, respectively. Additionally, we find that LLMs with different personality traits are differentially susceptible to jailbreak.

A successful solution could lead to more reliable AI systems, fostering public trust and encouraging broader adoption. Furthermore, it could pave the way for future research into more sophisticated alignment techniques, ultimately advancing our understanding of AI safety and ethics.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of aligning LLMs with human values without compromising their performance. Naive approaches may fail because they often overlook the nuanced interactions between model behavior and user expectations. Technical obstacles include the need for extensive datasets for training and evaluation, as well as the difficulty in quantifying safety and alignment metrics. Additionally, the dynamic nature of language and context makes it hard to predict model outputs accurately.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either performance or safety in isolation, often neglecting the interplay between the two. Existing solutions may lack transparency and reproducibility, making it difficult for the community to build upon them. Barriers include limited access to high-quality annotated datasets and the computational costs associated with fine-tuning models for safety. Our approach aims to integrate insights from both performance and safety research, leveraging novel alignment techniques and datasets to create a more holistic solution.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new alignment framework that incorporates both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and inference-time alignment techniques. We will utilize a diverse dataset that includes user interactions and safety evaluations to train the model. Metrics for success will include reductions in harmful outputs, improved user satisfaction, and enhanced alignment with human values.

As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of multilingual sentence encoders is the trade-off between monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Training for cross-lingual alignment of sentence embeddings distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks. In this work, we address both issues by modular training of sentence encoders, i.e., by separating monolingual specialization from cross-lingual alignment. We first efficiently train language-specific sentence encoders to avoid negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English monolingual encoders to the English encoder by training a cross-lingual alignment adapter on top of each, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. In both steps, we resort to contrastive learning on machine-translated paraphrase data. Monolingual and cross-lingual evaluations on semantic text similarity/relatedness and multiple-choice QA render our modular solution more effective than multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14878v1\", \"timestamp\": 1721483799, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a187f79c-793d-42d9-8242-cfae4b7a62d3\", \"authors\": [\"Hanan Aldarmaki\", \"Mona Diab\"], \"title\": \"Context-Aware Cross-Lingual Mapping\", \"abstract\": \"Cross-lingual word vectors are typically obtained by fitting an orthogonal matrix that maps the entries of a bilingual dictionary from a source to a target vector space.

We also implement cross-lingual mapping of deep contextualized word embeddings using parallel sentences with word alignments.

A successful approach could lead to more effective multilingual models that generalize better across languages, thereby improving applications such as multilingual document retrieval, question answering, and machine translation. This research could pave the way for future studies on unsupervised learning techniques and their applications in diverse linguistic settings, ultimately contributing to more inclusive AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent differences between languages, which can lead to misalignment in embeddings when training on limited data. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the nuances of semantic similarity across languages, potentially resulting in poor performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, the lack of sufficient parallel data complicates the training process, making it difficult to achieve robust cross-lingual representations. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can effectively leverage existing data while minimizing reliance on parallel corpora.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on supervised methods that require extensive parallel data, which is not always available for all languages. Additionally, many existing models suffer from the \"curse of multilinguality,\" where the performance on monolingual tasks is compromised due to shared parameters across languages. This has limited the exploration of unsupervised or weakly supervised approaches that could potentially address these issues. Our approach aims to fill this gap by utilizing contrastive learning techniques on English data to create universal embeddings that can be adapted to other languages without extensive parallel datasets.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a novel method called multilingual-SimCSE (mSimCSE), which extends the SimCSE framework to multilingual settings. Our methodology involves training on English data while leveraging unsupervised and weakly supervised techniques to generate high-quality cross-lingual embeddings. We will evaluate our approach using datasets such as XNLI for cross-lingual retrieval tasks and measure performance through metrics like semantic textual similarity and retrieval accuracy. We expect that our method will demonstrate comparable or superior performance to existing supervised methods, particularly in low-resource language scenarios, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing cross-lingual transferability.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 54822, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4}, "total_milestones": 4, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

In this paper, we put forth an efficient and effective framework termed language model GNN (LM-GNN) to jointly train large-scale language models and graph neural networks. The effectiveness in our framework is achieved by applying stage-wise fine-tuning of the BERT model first with heterogenous graph information and then with a GNN model. Several system and design optimizations are proposed to enable scalable and efficient training. LM-GNN accommodates node and edge classification as well as link prediction tasks.

Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot address the main space and computational bottleneck in GNNs, caused by the size and connectivity of the graph. To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification (UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale graphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular lottery ticket hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph lottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core sub-dataset and sparse sub-network, which can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full dense graph by iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural networks, GLT can be trained in isolation to match the performance of training with the full model and graph, and can be drawn from both randomly initialized and self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been experimentally verified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Specifically, for node classification, our found GLTs achieve the same accuracies with 20%~98% MACs saving on small graphs and 25%~85% MACs saving on large ones. For link prediction, GLTs lead to 48%~97% and 70% MACs saving on small and large graph datasets, respectively, without compromising predictive performance.

While end-to-end jointly optimizing GNNs and their accelerators is promising in boosting GNNs' inference efficiency and expediting the design process, it is still underexplored due to the vast and distinct design spaces of GNNs and their accelerators. In this work, we propose G-CoS, a GNN and accelerator co-search framework that can automatically search for matched GNN structures and accelerators to maximize both task accuracy and acceleration efficiency. Specifically, GCoS integrates two major enabling components: (1) a generic GNN accelerator search space which is applicable to various GNN structures and (2) a one-shot GNN and accelerator co-search algorithm that enables simultaneous and efficient search for optimal GNN structures and their matched accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, G-CoS is the first co-search framework for GNNs and their accelerators. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that the GNNs and accelerators generated by G-CoS consistently outperform SOTA GNNs and GNN accelerators in terms of both task accuracy and hardware efficiency, while only requiring a few hours for the end-to-end generation of the best matched GNNs and their accelerators.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08983v1\", \"timestamp\": 1631990164, \"domain\": \"cs.AR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3a055452-62e0-4509-9571-d19d4ea10a68\", \"authors\": [\"Zhili Wang\", \"Shimin Di\", \"Lei Chen\", \"Xiaofang Zhou\"], \"title\": \"Search to Fine-tune Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Tasks\", \"abstract\": \"Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown its unprecedented success in many graph-related tasks. However, GNNs face the label scarcity issue as other neural networks do. Thus, recent efforts try to pre-train GNNs on a large-scale unlabeled graph and adapt the knowledge from the unlabeled graph to the target downstream task. The adaptation is generally achieved by fine-tuning the pre-trained GNNs with a limited number of labeled data. Despite the importance of fine-tuning, current GNNs pre-training works often ignore designing a good fine-tuning strategy to better leverage transferred knowledge and improve the performance on downstream tasks. Only few works start to investigate a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs. But their designs either have strong assumptions or overlook the data-aware issue for various downstream datasets. Therefore, we aim to design a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs to improve the model performance in this paper. Given a pre-trained GNN, we propose to search to fine-tune pre-trained graph neural networks for graph-level tasks (S2PGNN), which adaptively design a suitable fine-tuning framework for the given labeled data on the downstream task. To ensure the improvement brought by searching fine-tuning strategy, we carefully summarize a proper search space of fine-tuning framework that is suitable for GNNs. The empirical studies show that S2PGNN can be implemented on the top of 10 famous pre-trained GNNs and consistently improve their performance. Besides, S2PGNN achieves better performance than existing fine-tuning strategies within and outside the GNN area.

In this work, we propose G-CoS, a GNN and accelerator co-search framework that can automatically search for matched GNN structures and accelerators to maximize both task accuracy and acceleration efficiency.

Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot address the main space and computational bottleneck in GNNs, caused by the size and connectivity of the graph. To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification (UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale graphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular lottery ticket hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph lottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core sub-dataset and sparse sub-network, which can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full dense graph by iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural networks, GLT can be trained in isolation to match the performance of training with the full model and graph, and can be drawn from both randomly initialized and self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been experimentally verified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Specifically, for node classification, our found GLTs achieve the same accuracies with 20%~98% MACs saving on small graphs and 25%~85% MACs saving on large ones.

The Unified CPU-GPU protocol instantiates multiple GNN training processes in parallel on both the CPU and the GPU. By allocating training processes on the CPU to perform GNN training collaboratively with the GPU, the proposed protocol improves the platform resource utilization and reduces the CPU-GPU data transfer overhead. Since the performance of a CPU and a GPU varies, we develop a novel load balancer that balances the workload dynamically between CPUs and GPUs during runtime. We evaluate our protocol using two representative GNN sampling algorithms, with two widely-used GNN models, on three datasets.

However, GNNs face the label scarcity issue as other neural networks do. Thus, recent efforts try to pre-train GNNs on a large-scale unlabeled graph and adapt the knowledge from the unlabeled graph to the target downstream task. The adaptation is generally achieved by fine-tuning the pre-trained GNNs with a limited number of labeled data. Despite the importance of fine-tuning, current GNNs pre-training works often ignore designing a good fine-tuning strategy to better leverage transferred knowledge and improve the performance on downstream tasks. Only few works start to investigate a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs. But their designs either have strong assumptions or overlook the data-aware issue for various downstream datasets. Therefore, we aim to design a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs to improve the model performance in this paper. Given a pre-trained GNN, we propose to search to fine-tune pre-trained graph neural networks for graph-level tasks (S2PGNN), which adaptively design a suitable fine-tuning framework for the given labeled data on the downstream task. To ensure the improvement brought by searching fine-tuning strategy, we carefully summarize a proper search space of fine-tuning framework that is suitable for GNNs. The empirical studies show that S2PGNN can be implemented on the top of 10 famous pre-trained GNNs and consistently improve their performance. Besides, S2PGNN achieves better performance than existing fine-tuning strategies within and outside the GNN area.

A well-designed dataset would enable researchers to benchmark GNN performance more effectively, leading to improved model architectures and training techniques.

Improving trainability could lead to significant advancements in various fields such as quantum materials, biochemistry, and high-energy physics, where QML can provide a competitive edge over classical methods. This research could pave the way for practical applications of QML, making it more accessible and applicable in real-world scenarios, thus influencing future research directions and methodologies in both quantum computing and machine learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing the trainability of QML models stem from the inherent complexities of quantum systems, which exhibit behaviors that are not easily modeled or understood using classical approaches. Naive methods may fail due to the high sensitivity of quantum states to noise and errors, as well as the difficulty in optimizing quantum circuits effectively. Additionally, the lack of robust theoretical frameworks for understanding the dynamics of QML models complicates the development of effective training algorithms. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative approaches that can integrate quantum mechanics with advanced machine learning techniques.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on developing quantum algorithms without adequately addressing the practical challenges of training these models on near-term quantum devices. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of scalable training methods and insufficient understanding of the interplay between quantum dynamics and machine learning processes. Additionally, many studies have not explored hybrid approaches that combine classical and quantum techniques effectively. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by proposing a novel framework that integrates quantum reservoir computing with advanced optimization techniques, thus enhancing the trainability of QML models.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hybrid quantum-classical framework that utilizes quantum reservoir computing to capture complex dynamics while employing classical optimization techniques for training. We will use benchmark datasets relevant to quantum applications, such as quantum materials and biochemistry datasets, to evaluate the performance of our models. Metrics for success will include accuracy, training time, and robustness against noise.

For the analysis, we need to find appropriate embedding functions. Although several neural network-based methods have been proposed for learning embedding functions, existing methods require long time-series for training neural networks. This limitation prohibits performing Koopman spectral analysis in applications where only short time-series are available. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for estimating embedding functions from unseen short time-series by exploiting knowledge learned from related but different time-series. With the proposed method, a representation of a given short time-series is obtained by a bidirectional LSTM for extracting its properties. The embedding function of the short time-series is modeled by a neural network that depends on the time-series representation. By sharing the LSTM and neural networks across multiple time-series, we can learn common knowledge from different time-series while modeling time-series-specific embedding functions with the time-series representation. Our model is trained such that the expected test prediction error is minimized with the episodic training framework. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of eigenvalue estimation and future prediction than existing methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04683v1\", \"timestamp\": 1612855159, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"76bfd45a-357b-4128-a117-9019d8dec1a4\", \"authors\": [\"Yifu Cai\", \"Arjun Choudhry\", \"Mononito Goswami\", \"Artur Dubrawski\"], \"title\": \"TimeSeriesExam: A time series understanding exam\", \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated a remarkable ability to model time series data.

To address this gap, we introduce TimeSeriesExam, a configurable and scalable multiple-choice question exam designed to assess LLMs across five core time series understanding categories: pattern recognition, noise understanding, similarity analysis, anomaly detection, and causality analysis. TimeSeriesExam comprises of over 700 questions, procedurally generated using 104 carefully curated templates and iteratively refined to balance difficulty and their ability to discriminate good from bad models. We test 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on the TimeSeriesExam and provide the first comprehensive evaluation of their time series understanding abilities. Our results suggest that closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini understand simple time series concepts significantly better than their open-source counterparts, while all models struggle with complex concepts such as causality analysis.

In our approach we define a cyclic coordinate of intrinsic time scale of time series data after empirical mode decomposition. A spinor field of time series data comes from the rotation of data around price and time axis by defining a new extradimension to time series data. We show that there exist hidden eight dimensions in Kolmogorov space for time series data. Our concept is realized as the algorithm of empirical mode decomposition and intrinsic time scale decomposition and it is subsequently used for preliminary analysis on the real time series data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03901v1\", \"timestamp\": 1465564424, \"domain\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"540eddb3-4133-40d1-ab7d-504a3e5cd697\", \"authors\": [\"Tomoharu Iwata\", \"Yoshinobu Kawahara\"], \"title\": \"Meta-Learning for Koopman Spectral Analysis with Short Time-series\", \"abstract\": \"Koopman spectral analysis has attracted attention for nonlinear dynamical systems since we can analyze nonlinear dynamics with a linear regime by embedding data into a Koopman space by a nonlinear function. For the analysis, we need to find appropriate embedding functions. Although several neural network-based methods have been proposed for learning embedding functions, existing methods require long time-series for training neural networks. This limitation prohibits performing Koopman spectral analysis in applications where only short time-series are available. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for estimating embedding functions from unseen short time-series by exploiting knowledge learned from related but different time-series. With the proposed method, a representation of a given short time-series is obtained by a bidirectional LSTM for extracting its properties. The embedding function of the short time-series is modeled by a neural network that depends on the time-series representation. By sharing the LSTM and neural networks across multiple time-series, we can learn common knowledge from different time-series while modeling time-series-specific embedding functions with the time-series representation. Our model is trained such that the expected test prediction error is minimized with the episodic training framework. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of eigenvalue estimation and future prediction than existing methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04683v1\", \"timestamp\": 1612855159, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"1b166db8-4224-410a-8194-1e77bbf1b1d2\", \"authors\": [\"Yifu Cai\", \"Arjun Choudhry\", \"Mononito Goswami\", \"Artur Dubrawski\"], \"title\": \"TimeSeriesExam: A time series understanding exam\", \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated a remarkable ability to model time series data.

To address this gap, we introduce TimeSeriesExam, a configurable and scalable multiple-choice question exam designed to assess LLMs across five core time series understanding categories: pattern recognition, noise understanding, similarity analysis, anomaly detection, and causality analysis. TimeSeriesExam comprises of over 700 questions, procedurally generated using 104 carefully curated templates and iteratively refined to balance difficulty and their ability to discriminate good from bad models. We test 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on the TimeSeriesExam and provide the first comprehensive evaluation of their time series understanding abilities. Our results suggest that closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini understand simple time series concepts significantly better than their open-source counterparts, while all models struggle with complex concepts such as causality analysis.

Improved forecasting methods can have significant implications across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and environmental science, where understanding the interplay between multiple time series is essential for decision-making. This research could pave the way for future studies that explore advanced modeling techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of multivariate time series data arises from the intricate and dynamic relationships between different series, which can vary significantly over time. Naive approaches may fail to capture these relationships due to their inability to adapt to changing correlations and dependencies. Additionally, the challenge of integrating frequency domain analysis with deep learning techniques requires sophisticated methodologies that can handle high-dimensional data and ensure robust performance across diverse datasets.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on either intra-series dependencies or static inter-series correlations, neglecting the dynamic nature of these relationships across different time scales. Existing models may lack the flexibility to adapt to varying correlations, leading to suboptimal performance. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced techniques such as adaptive graph convolution and self-attention mechanisms, which have not been fully explored in the context of multivariate time series forecasting.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a deep learning model, MSGNet, that utilizes frequency domain analysis to decompose time series data into distinct time scales. The model will incorporate an adaptive mixhop graph convolution layer to learn inter-series correlations dynamically and a self-attention mechanism to capture intra-series dependencies. We will evaluate the model using real-world datasets and metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to assess its forecasting accuracy.

Improved data augmentation techniques can lead to better generalization of classifiers, which is essential for real-world applications across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. A paper addressing this question could pave the way for future research on automated augmentation methods, potentially leading to more robust models that require less manual tuning and can adapt to new datasets more efficiently.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to balance effective data augmentation with the preservation of label integrity. Naive approaches may fail because they might introduce noise or distortions that mislead the classifier, leading to poor performance. Additionally, the interaction between augmentation techniques and model hyperparameters can be intricate, requiring careful analysis and experimentation. There are also theoretical challenges in understanding how different augmentation strategies impact the learning process and optimization dynamics.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on specific augmentation techniques without a comprehensive framework that integrates automated methods and considers label preservation.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021).

Herein, we consider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end, introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular alignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole force. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the optical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole force, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could be based.

To understand this apparent discrepancy, we theoretically model the molecular discs in a sample of eight nearby spiral galaxies and estimate their molecular scale heights (Half Width at Half Maxima (HWHM)). We assume that the baryonic discs are in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under their mutual gravity in the external force field of the dark matter halo. We set up the joint Poisson's-Boltzman equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and numerically solve it to obtain the three-dimensional molecular gas distribution and determine the scale heights in our sample galaxies.

We further incline the dynamical models to an inclination of 90$^o$ to estimate the expected observed thickness of the molecular discs.

We develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in 3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms) chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order of magnitude at room temperature.

The proposed method considers both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and the total uncertainties are recalibrated post hoc using a nonlinear scaling function to achieve good calibration on previously unseen data, without loss of predictive accuracy.

A detailed analysis of the predictive performance and uncertainty calibration is provided. In all experiments, the proposed method achieved low prediction error and good uncertainty calibration, with predicted uncertainty correlating with expected error, on energy and forces.

Herein, we consider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end, introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular alignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole force. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the optical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole force, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could be based.

To understand this apparent discrepancy, we theoretically model the molecular discs in a sample of eight nearby spiral galaxies and estimate their molecular scale heights (Half Width at Half Maxima (HWHM)). We assume that the baryonic discs are in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under their mutual gravity in the external force field of the dark matter halo. We set up the joint Poisson's-Boltzman equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and numerically solve it to obtain the three-dimensional molecular gas distribution and determine the scale heights in our sample galaxies.

The molecular scale heights in our sample galaxies are found to vary between 50-200 pc depending on the galaxy and radius. Using the density solutions, we build dynamical models of the molecular discs and produce molecular column density maps. These model maps found to match to the observed ones reasonably well. We further incline the dynamical models to an inclination of 90$^o$ to estimate the expected observed thickness of the molecular discs.

We develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in 3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms) chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order of magnitude at room temperature.

However, when IFCs are applied on uncertain bimolecular (and hence most intracellular) networks, we show that preventing NECs generally becomes an intractable problem as the number of interacting molecular species increases.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10668v3\", \"timestamp\": 1613935723, \"domain\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"1fa44f51-fa0f-46b6-ab46-8063874db2ab\", \"authors\": [\"Seongok Ryu\", \"Yongchan Kwon\", \"Woo Youn Kim\"], \"title\": \"Uncertainty quantification of molecular property prediction using Bayesian neural network models\", \"abstract\": \"In chemistry, deep neural network models have been increasingly utilized in a variety of applications such as molecular property predictions, novel molecule designs, and planning chemical reactions. Despite the rapid increase in the use of state-of-the-art models and algorithms, deep neural network models often produce poor predictions in real applications because model performance is highly dependent on the quality of training data. In the field of molecular analysis, data are mostly obtained from either complicated chemical experiments or approximate mathematical equations, and then quality of data may be questioned.In this paper, we quantify uncertainties of prediction using Bayesian neural networks in molecular property predictions. We estimate both model-driven and data-driven uncertainties, demonstrating the usefulness of uncertainty quantification as both a quality checker and a confidence indicator with the three experiments.

Herein, we consider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end, introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular alignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole force. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the optical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole force, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could be based.

However, contradicting this understanding, recent studies have revealed considerably thick molecular discs in nearby spiral galaxies. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we theoretically model the molecular discs in a sample of eight nearby spiral galaxies and estimate their molecular scale heights (Half Width at Half Maxima (HWHM)). We assume that the baryonic discs are in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under their mutual gravity in the external force field of the dark matter halo. We set up the joint Poisson's-Boltzman equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and numerically solve it to obtain the three-dimensional molecular gas distribution and determine the scale heights in our sample galaxies. We find that the scale heights follow a universal exponential law with a scale length of $0.46 \\\\pm 0.01 \\\\ r_{25}$. The molecular scale heights in our sample galaxies are found to vary between 50-200 pc depending on the galaxy and radius. Using the density solutions, we build dynamical models of the molecular discs and produce molecular column density maps. These model maps found to match to the observed ones reasonably well. We further incline the dynamical models to an inclination of 90$^o$ to estimate the expected observed thickness of the molecular discs. Interestingly it is found that at edge-on orientation, our sample galaxies under hydrostatic assumption can easily produce a few kpc thick observable molecular disc.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13053v1\", \"timestamp\": 1588010413, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2110a427-15ed-4df6-bb46-f5df84060e02\", \"authors\": [\"Dvira Segal\", \"Abraham Nitzan\", \"Peter Hanggi\"], \"title\": \"Thermal conductance through molecular wires\", \"abstract\": \"We consider phononic heat transport through molecular chains connecting two thermal reservoirs. For relatively short molecules at normal temperatures heat conduction is dominated by the harmonic part of the molecular force-field. We develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in 3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms) chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order of magnitude at room temperature.

Here, we performed a theoretical analysis to tackle this question. We show that in general AM-AFM measurements, the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope whereas the conventional equation is only valid for excitation exactly at the resonance frequency.

By improving uncertainty quantification, researchers can make more informed decisions based on model predictions, leading to better experimental designs and more efficient resource allocation. This work could pave the way for future research that integrates uncertainty estimation into various machine learning applications in chemistry and physics, ultimately advancing our understanding of molecular interactions.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nQuantifying uncertainty in molecular predictions is challenging due to the complex nature of molecular systems and the limitations of current GNN models, which often struggle with out-of-distribution data. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the intricacies of molecular interactions or the need for robust uncertainty measures. Technical obstacles include the need for high-quality training data that captures the full dimensionality of potential energy surfaces and the development of models that can generalize well beyond the training domain.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has largely focused on improving predictive accuracy without adequately addressing uncertainty quantification. Existing methods often fall short in either predictive performance or uncertainty estimation, failing to satisfy the specific requirements of molecular force fields. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate uncertainty measures into GNN architectures and the challenge of developing models that can handle the diverse conformations encountered in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach aims to fill this gap by introducing a new framework that combines GNNs with uncertainty quantification techniques.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a methodology that integrates Localized Neural Kernel (LNK) with GNNs to provide reliable uncertainty estimates in molecular force predictions. The approach will involve training the model on a diverse dataset of molecular configurations, utilizing metrics such as AUC-ROC scores to evaluate performance. We expect that our method will demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to existing techniques, ultimately leading to more reliable molecular dynamics simulations and better decision-making in practical applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 123422, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4, "agent4": 5, "agent5": 4, "agent6": 5, "agent7": 3}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 5, "feasibility": 4}}

On the\none hand, numerous old problems have been revisited with\ndeep neural networks and huge progress has been made in\nmany tasks previously seemed out of reach, such as machine\ntranslation and computer vision. On the other hand, new\ntechniques such as geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al.\n2017) are being developed to generalize deep neural models\nto new or non-traditional domains.\nIt is well known that training a deep neural model typi-\ncally requires a large amount of labeled data, which cannot\nbe satis\ufb01ed in many scenarios due to the high cost of labeling\ntraining data. To reduce the amount of data needed for train-\ning, a recent surge of research interest has focused on few-\nshot learning (Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum 2015;\nRezende et al. 2016) \u2013 to learn a classi\ufb01cation model with\nvery few examples from each class. Closely related to few-\nshot learning is semi-supervised learning, where a large\n\u0003Corresponding author.\nCopyright c\r2018, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

The key issue is\nto maximize the effective utilization of structural and fea-\nture information of unlabeled data. Due to the powerful fea-\nture extraction capability and recent success of deep neu-\nral networks, there have been some successful attempts to\nrevisit semi-supervised learning with neural-network-based\nmodels, including ladder network (Rasmus et al. 2015),\nsemi-supervised embedding (Weston et al. 2008), planetoid\n(Yang, Cohen, and Salakhutdinov 2016), and graph convo-\nlutional networks (Kipf and Welling 2017).\nThe recently developed graph convolutional neural net-\nworks (GCNNs) (Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst\n2016) is a successful attempt of generalizing the power-\nful convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in dealing with\nEuclidean data to modeling graph-structured data. In their\npilot work (Kipf and Welling 2017), Kipf and Welling pro-\nposed a simpli\ufb01ed type of GCNNs, called graph convolu-\ntional networks (GCNs), and applied it to semi-supervised\nclassi\ufb01cation. The GCN model naturally integrates the con-\nnectivity patterns and feature attributes of graph-structured\ndata, and outperforms many state-of-the-art results of other baselines are\ncopied from (Kipf and Welling 2017).

This paper con-\ntributes to the understanding of the GCN model and its appli-\ncation in semi-supervised classi\ufb01cation. Our analysis not\nonly reveals the mechanisms and limitations of the GCN\nmodel, but also leads to new solutions overcoming its limits.\nIn future work, we plan to develop new convolutional \ufb01lters\nwhich are compatible with deep architectures, and exploit\nadvanced deep learning techniques to improve the perfor-\nmance of GCNs for more graph-based applications.

GraphHeat achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification across three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16002v1\", \"timestamp\": 1595850832, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we develop a more effective graph convolutional network (GCN) that dynamically learns optimal graph structures for semi-supervised learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the limitations of existing GCNs that rely on fixed graph structures, which may not be optimal for all datasets. By creating a GCN that can adaptively learn the graph structure, we can significantly enhance the performance of semi-supervised learning models. This advancement could lead to better classification accuracy in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what is achievable with machine learning in graph-structured data.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of simultaneously optimizing both the graph structure and the learning process. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the interdependencies between the graph structure and the features of the data. Additionally, there are technical obstacles in designing algorithms that can efficiently learn from both labeled and unlabeled data while maintaining computational feasibility, especially with large graphs. The need for a robust framework that can handle these complexities without sacrificing performance is critical.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on static graph structures, which limits their adaptability to different datasets. Existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between model complexity and performance, leading to either overfitting or underutilization of available data. Moreover, many approaches do not effectively integrate the learning of graph structures with the classification task. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by proposing a unified model that learns both the graph structure and the classification simultaneously, thus improving upon prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel Adaptive Graph Learning-Convolutional Network (AGLCN) that integrates graph learning and convolutional operations. We will utilize benchmark datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed for evaluation. The key metrics for assessing performance will include classification accuracy and computational efficiency. We expect that AGLCN will outperform existing GCNs by dynamically adjusting the graph structure based on the data, leading to improved semi-supervised learning outcomes and demonstrating the potential for broader applications in graph-based machine learning tasks.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 53874, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 6, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 6}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

While recent advancements in text-to-avatar generation have yielded diverse human avatars from text prompts, these methods typically combine all elements-clothes, hair, and body-into a single 3D representation. Such an entangled approach poses challenges for downstream tasks like editing or animation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel disentangled 3D avatar representation named Sequentially Offset-SMPL (SO-SMPL), building upon the SMPL model. SO-SMPL represents the human body and clothes with two separate meshes but associates them with offsets to ensure the physical alignment between the body and the clothes. Then, we design a Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based distillation framework to generate the proposed SO-SMPL representation from text prompts.

Text2Avatar leverages a discrete codebook as an intermediate feature to establish a connection between text and avatars, enabling the disentanglement of features. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of realistic style 3D human avatar data, we utilize a pre-trained unconditional 3D human avatar generation model to obtain a large amount of 3D avatar pseudo data, which allows Text2Avatar to achieve realistic style generation.

To address these limitations, we propose AvatarStudio, a coarse-to-fine generative model that generates explicit textured 3D meshes for animatable human avatars. Specifically, AvatarStudio begins with a low-resolution NeRF-based representation for coarse generation, followed by incorporating SMPL-guided articulation into the explicit mesh representation to support avatar animation and high resolution rendering. To ensure view consistency and pose controllability of the resulting avatars, we introduce a 2D diffusion model conditioned on DensePose for Score Distillation Sampling supervision. By effectively leveraging the synergy between the articulated mesh representation and the DensePose-conditional diffusion model, AvatarStudio can create high-quality avatars from text that are ready for animation, significantly outperforming previous methods. Moreover, it is competent for many applications, e.g., multimodal avatar animations and style-guided avatar creation.

In this work, we propose ParDy-Human (Parameterized Dynamic Human Avatar), a fully explicit approach to construct a digital avatar from as little as a single monocular sequence. ParDy-Human introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method is composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians according to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their designed joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with dynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a rasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic human avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our avatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be trained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images efficiently even on consumer hardware.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel disentangled 3D avatar representation named Sequentially Offset-SMPL (SO-SMPL), building upon the SMPL model.

In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\\\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\\\"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping.

Additionally, the absence of 3D observations, such as scans or depth data, leads to ambiguities in occluded body parts, resulting in artifacts during animation. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of accurately capturing and representing the intricate details of human motion and expression without sufficient data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious methods often relied on extensive datasets with high-quality annotations or 3D scans, which are impractical for everyday video inputs.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28]. However, the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

In addition, we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real environments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09133v1\", \"timestamp\": 1540196459, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve the detection of anomalous sounds in industrial machinery using unsupervised learning techniques that account for the variability in normal sound distributions across different machines?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nImproving anomalous sound detection (ASD) is crucial for enhancing predictive maintenance in industrial settings, which can lead to reduced downtime and maintenance costs. This research could significantly impact the field by providing more robust detection methods that do not rely on extensive labeled datasets, thus advancing the state of the art in machine learning applications for industrial monitoring. It could also lead to practical applications in various industries, improving safety and operational efficiency.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges include the high variability of normal sounds across different machines, which complicates the learning of a generalized model for anomaly detection. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the non-stationary nature of sound signals, leading to high false positive rates. Additionally, the lack of available anomalous sound samples for training makes it difficult to develop effective supervised models, necessitating innovative unsupervised techniques.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on supervised learning methods that require labeled anomalous data, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised methods may not adequately address the variability in normal sound distributions, leading to poor performance in distinguishing between normal and anomalous sounds. Our approach aims to leverage machine identity information and advanced feature extraction techniques to improve detection accuracy, addressing the limitations of prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel unsupervised learning framework that incorporates machine identity as a condition for encoding in the latent feature space. We will utilize a dataset of normal sounds from various machines and apply metrics such as reconstruction error and anomaly scores to evaluate performance. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in the accuracy of anomalous sound detection, demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets, ultimately leading to a more reliable monitoring system for industrial applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 50155, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 3}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022).

For example, if word embeddings of similar words contain similar values, word similarity can be readily assessed, whereas judging that from their spelling is often impossible (e.g. cat /feline) and to predetermine and store similarities between all words is prohibitively time-consuming, memory intensive and subjective. We focus on word embeddings learned from text corpora and knowledge graphs. Several well-known algorithms learn word embeddings from text on an unsupervised basis by learning to predict those words that occur around each word, e.g. word2vec and GloVe. Parameters of such word embeddings are known to reflect word co-occurrence statistics, but how they capture semantic meaning has been unclear. Knowledge graph representation models learn representations both of entities (words, people, places, etc.) and relations between them, typically by training a model to predict known facts in a supervised manner. Despite steady improvements in fact prediction accuracy, little is understood of the latent structure that enables this.   The limited understanding of how latent semantic structure is encoded in the geometry of word embeddings and knowledge graph representations makes a principled means of improving their performance, reliability or interpretability unclear.

This taxonomy can serve as concrete guidance for making major architectural design decisions when designing foundation model based systems and highlights trade-offs arising from design decisions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05352v6\", \"timestamp\": 1683632236, \"domain\": \"cs.SE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f5c7cf26-ad5b-4af9-8879-7b2efe047479\", \"authors\": [\"Binjie Zhang\", \"Yixiao Ge\", \"Xuyuan Xu\", \"Ying Shan\", \"Mike Zheng Shou\"], \"title\": \"TaCA: Upgrading Your Visual Foundation Model with Task-agnostic Compatible Adapter\", \"abstract\": \"Visual foundation models like CLIP excel in learning feature representations from extensive datasets through self-supervised methods, demonstrating remarkable transfer learning and generalization capabilities. A growing number of applications based on visual foundation models are emerging, including innovative solutions such as BLIP-2. These applications employ pre-trained CLIP models as upstream feature extractors and train various downstream modules to accomplish diverse tasks. In situations involving system upgrades that require updating the upstream foundation model, it becomes essential to re-train all downstream modules to adapt to the new foundation model, which is inflexible and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a parameter-efficient and task-agnostic adapter, dubbed TaCA, that facilitates compatibility across distinct foundation models while ensuring enhanced performance for the new models. TaCA allows downstream applications to seamlessly integrate better-performing foundation models without necessitating retraining. We conduct extensive experimental validation of TaCA using different scales of models with up to one billion parameters on various tasks such as video-text retrieval, video recognition, and visual question answering. The results consistently demonstrate the emergent ability of TaCA on hot-plugging upgrades for visual foundation models.

By improving multilingual capabilities, we can foster inclusivity in AI applications, enabling better communication, education, and information dissemination. This research could lead to advancements in natural language processing, machine translation, and cross-lingual understanding, ultimately influencing future AI model development and deployment strategies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing the performance of foundation models across multiple languages, especially when dealing with low-resource languages that lack sufficient training data. Naive approaches, such as simple fine-tuning, may lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses proficiency in high-resource languages while trying to learn new ones. Additionally, the complexities of language structure, cultural nuances, and varying levels of linguistic representation pose significant obstacles. Technical challenges include optimizing model architecture and training processes to ensure efficient learning without compromising existing capabilities.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages underexplored. Limitations in available datasets, computational resources, and the lack of effective transfer learning techniques have hindered progress. Additionally, existing models may not have been designed with multilinguality as a core feature, leading to performance trade-offs. Our approach aims to integrate advanced techniques such as knowledge distillation and adaptive training strategies to enhance multilingual performance while preserving the strengths of high-resource language capabilities.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new training framework that incorporates a diverse multilingual dataset, leveraging transfer learning techniques to enhance low-resource language performance. We will utilize a combination of fine-tuning and knowledge distillation to maintain high-resource language capabilities while introducing new languages. Metrics for evaluation will include language-specific accuracy, model efficiency, and cross-lingual transfer performance. We expect our approach to yield a foundation model that excels in multilingual tasks, demonstrating improved performance in low-resource languages without sacrificing the effectiveness in high-resource languages.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 69372, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 6, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 6, "agent4": 7}, "total_milestones": 7, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 3}}

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores.

We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of age stereotypes as a voice disguise strategy, as a follow up to our recent work where 60 native Finnish speakers attempted to sound like an elderly and like a child. In that study, we presented evidence that both ASV and human observers could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable the presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The interesting cases would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV system, and which a typical listener cannot detect as being a disguise. We carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) crowd-workers. A total of 91 listeners participated in the test and were instructed to estimate both the speaker's chronological and intended age. The results indicate that age estimations for the intended old and child voices for female speakers were towards the target age groups, while for male speakers, the age estimations corresponded to the direction of the target voice only for elderly voices. In the case of intended child's voice, listeners estimated the age of male speakers to be older than their chronological age for most of the speakers and not the intended target age.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08910v2\", \"timestamp\": 1524560825, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"cd56e117-6976-47d7-8c37-f5e3315581c8\", \"authors\": [\"Ouba\\u00efda Chouchane\", \"Michele Panariello\", \"Oualid Zari\", \"Ismet Kerenciler\", \"Imen Chihaoui\", \"Massimiliano Todisco\", \"Melek \\u00d6nen\"], \"title\": \"Differentially Private Adversarial Auto-Encoder to Protect Gender in Voice Biometrics\", \"abstract\": \"Over the last decade, the use of Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems has become increasingly widespread in response to the growing need for secure and efficient identity verification methods. The voice data encompasses a wealth of personal information, which includes but is not limited to gender, age, health condition, stress levels, and geographical and socio-cultural origins. These attributes, known as soft biometrics, are private and the user may wish to keep them confidential. However, with the advancement of machine learning algorithms, soft biometrics can be inferred automatically, creating the potential for unauthorized use. As such, it is crucial to ensure the protection of these personal data that are inherent within the voice while retaining the utility of identity recognition. In this paper, we present an adversarial Auto-Encoder--based approach to hide gender-related information in speaker embeddings, while preserving their effectiveness for speaker verification.

In addition to the targeted information, these representations usually contain sensitive information about the speaker, like the age, sex, physical state, education level or ethnicity. In order to allow the user to choose which information to protect, we introduce in this paper the concept of attribute-driven privacy preservation in speaker voice representation. It allows a person to hide one or more personal aspects to a potential malicious interceptor and to the application provider.

Therefore, we adopt the face age estimation method to predict the speaker age value from the associated visual data, then label the audio recording with the estimated age. We construct multiple Cross-Age test sets on VoxCeleb (Vox-CA), which deliberately select the positive trials with large age-gap. Also, the effect of nationality and gender is considered in selecting negative pairs to align with Vox-H cases. The baseline system performance drops from 1.939\\\\% EER on the Vox-H test set to 10.419\\\\% on the Vox-CA20 test set, which indicates how difficult the cross-age scenario is. Consequently, we propose an age-decoupling adversarial learning (ADAL) method to alleviate the negative effect of the age gap and reduce intra-class variance. Our method outperforms the baseline system by over 10\\\\% related EER reduction on the Vox-CA20 test set.

The voice data encompasses a wealth of personal information, which includes but is not limited to gender, age, health condition, stress levels, and geographical and socio-cultural origins. These attributes, known as soft biometrics, are private and the user may wish to keep them confidential. However, with the advancement of machine learning algorithms, soft biometrics can be inferred automatically, creating the potential for unauthorized use. As such, it is crucial to ensure the protection of these personal data that are inherent within the voice while retaining the utility of identity recognition. In this paper, we present an adversarial Auto-Encoder--based approach to hide gender-related information in speaker embeddings, while preserving their effectiveness for speaker verification. We use an adversarial procedure against a gender classifier and incorporate a layer based on the Laplace mechanism into the Auto-Encoder architecture. This layer adds Laplace noise for more robust gender concealment and ensures differential privacy guarantees during inference for the output speaker embeddings. Experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb dataset demonstrate that speaker verification tasks can be effectively carried out while concealing speaker gender and ensuring differential privacy guarantees; moreover, the intensity of the Laplace noise can be tuned to select the desired trade-off between privacy and utility.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02135v1\", \"timestamp\": 1688549088, \"domain\": \"eess.AS\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3765008f-2de3-4fe2-9c45-baac5a8cbb4a\", \"authors\": [\"Bhavana V.

This research could lead to advancements in speaker recognition technology, enabling systems to better handle variations in voice due to aging. It may also inform the development of more robust models that can adapt to demographic changes, ultimately enhancing user trust and system effectiveness.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complex interplay between aging and voice characteristics, which can vary significantly across individuals and languages. Naive approaches may fail to account for these variations, leading to inaccurate models. Additionally, the need for large, diverse datasets that capture the aging process in different contexts complicates the research. Technical obstacles include developing models that can effectively generalize across age groups while maintaining high verification accuracy.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on single languages or limited datasets, neglecting the broader implications of aging across different demographics. There is a lack of comprehensive studies that analyze the aging effect in a cross-linguistic and gender-sensitive manner. Existing models may not adequately address the nuances of aging, leading to gaps in understanding. This research aims to fill these gaps by employing a more inclusive approach that considers multiple languages and genders.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves using linear mixed effect (LME) models to analyze ASV scores across different age groups, genders, and languages. The study will utilize datasets such as VoxCeleb and LCFSH, focusing on both short-term and long-term aging effects. Metrics will include equal error rate (EER) and ASV scores to evaluate model performance.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al.

By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures.

To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification. The results show that our method consistently improves the classification accuracies.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01412v1\", \"timestamp\": 1604367941, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e6a15466-9dfc-4a35-b328-03f2e8d31577\", \"authors\": [\"Andrew Carr\", \"David Wingate\"], \"title\": \"Graph Neural Processes: Towards Bayesian Graph Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"We introduce Graph Neural Processes (GNP), inspired by the recent work in conditional and latent neural processes.

The goal of graph representation learning is to generate graph representation vectors that capture the structure and features of large graphs accurately. This is especially important because the quality of the graph representation vectors will affect the performance of these vectors in downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction and anomaly detection. Many techniques are proposed for generating effective graph representation vectors. Two of the most prevalent categories of graph representation learning are graph embedding methods without using graph neural nets (GNN), which we denote as non-GNN based graph embedding methods, and graph neural nets (GNN) based methods. Non-GNN graph embedding methods are based on techniques such as random walks, temporal point processes and neural network learning methods. GNN-based methods, on the other hand, are the application of deep learning on graph data. In this survey, we provide an overview of these two categories and cover the current state-of-the-art methods for both static and dynamic graphs.

By leveraging LLMs, this research could lead to more robust and accurate graph representations, enhancing various applications such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and anomaly detection. This work could pave the way for future research into integrating natural language processing with graph learning, potentially leading to innovative methodologies and practical applications in diverse fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of graph structures and the variability of noise and sparsity in real-world data. Naive approaches may fail because they might not adequately account for the intricate dependencies and relationships within the graph. Additionally, effectively integrating LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs) requires overcoming technical hurdles related to data representation, model training, and ensuring that the LLMs can accurately interpret and refine graph structures without introducing further bias or inaccuracies.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on explicit graph structures and their direct applications, often neglecting the potential of LLMs in this context. Limitations include a lack of methodologies that effectively combine LLMs with GNNs for graph refinement, as well as insufficient exploration of how textual data associated with nodes can inform graph structure learning. This research proposes a novel approach that integrates LLMs into the graph learning process, addressing these gaps and improving upon existing methods by focusing on noise reduction and implicit dependency discovery.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing a model called GraphEdit, which utilizes LLMs to analyze and refine graph structures. The approach will include the following components: \n1. **Method**: A two-step process where the model first identifies and corrects noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and then uncovers implicit node-wise dependencies.\n2. **Dataset**: The model will be tested on various graph-structured datasets, including social networks and recommender systems, to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n3. **Metrics**: Performance will be measured using metrics such as accuracy in node classification, reduction in noise, and improvement in graph representation quality.\nThe expected outcomes include enhanced graph structures that are more resilient to noise and sparsity, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 50254, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4}, "total_milestones": 4, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere.

Cybersecurity is a notable application area, where defending networks against sophisticated adversaries remains a challenging task typically performed by teams of security operators. In this work, we explore novel MARL strategies for building autonomous cyber network defenses that address challenges such as large policy spaces, partial observability, and stealthy, deceptive adversarial strategies. To facilitate efficient and generalized learning, we propose a hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture that decomposes the cyber defense task into specific sub-tasks like network investigation and host recovery. Our approach involves training sub-policies for each sub-task using PPO enhanced with domain expertise. These sub-policies are then leveraged by a master defense policy that coordinates their selection to solve complex network defense tasks. Furthermore, the sub-policies can be fine-tuned and transferred with minimal cost to defend against shifts in adversarial behavior or changes in network settings. We conduct extensive experiments using CybORG Cage 4, the state-of-the-art MARL environment for cyber defense. Comparisons with multiple baselines across different adversaries show that our hierarchical learning approach achieves top performance in terms of convergence speed, episodic return, and several interpretable metrics relevant to cybersecurity, including the fraction of clean machines on the network, precision, and false positives on recoveries.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17351v2\", \"timestamp\": 1729622105, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"71040b6a-275e-43d2-9cd0-309959cfc69b\", \"authors\": [\"Tao Li\", \"Quanyan Zhu\"], \"title\": \"Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare\", \"abstract\": \"We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation.

This workshop was organized to share research that explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as foundational capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably and effectively defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats.   Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the adoption of AI and ML techniques to both cyber and non-cyber settings. Bridging critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural shifts in user behavior over time.   The Workshop (held on August 19th and 20th 2021 in Montreal-themed virtual reality) was comprised of technical presentations and a panel discussion focused on open problems and potential research solutions.

By improving the adaptability and generalization of these agents, we can significantly enhance the resilience of cybersecurity systems, leading to more robust defenses against attacks. This research could pave the way for future studies on multi-agent systems and their applications in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, ultimately contributing to the development of intelligent, self-learning defense strategies that can operate in unpredictable environments.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of cyber environments, which are characterized by constantly changing network topologies and configurations. Traditional reinforcement learning methods often struggle with fixed observation and action spaces, making it difficult for agents to adapt to new situations. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the dynamic nature of cyber threats or the need for agents to learn from diverse experiences. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can effectively decompose tasks and enable agents to generalize their learning across various scenarios.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on static environments or specific network configurations, limiting the applicability of developed solutions. Additionally, existing methods may not adequately address the need for agents to adapt to rapid changes in adversarial behavior or network conditions. Barriers such as the lack of high-fidelity simulation environments and the complexity of designing agents that can learn effectively in diverse settings have hindered progress. Our approach aims to leverage entity-based reinforcement learning, which allows for more flexible and generalizable policies, thus addressing these limitations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using entity-based reinforcement learning to decompose the observation and action spaces of cyber defense agents into discrete entities, allowing for compositional generalization. We will utilize the Yawning Titan cyber-security simulation environment as our dataset, training a Transformer-based policy to evaluate its performance across various network topologies.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION Neural networks are mathematical models that simulate the way neurons operate in the brain. The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5].

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5].

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning.

Due to the large data scale in histology, deep learning methods play an increasingly significant role as feature extractors. Existing solutions heavily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for global pixel-level analysis, leaving the underlying local geometric structure such as the interaction between cells in the tumor microenvironment unexplored. The topological structure in medical images, as proven to be closely related to tumor evolution, can be well characterized by graphs. To obtain a more comprehensive representation for downstream oncology tasks, we propose a fusion framework for enhancing the global image-level representation captured by CNNs with the geometry of cell-level spatial information learned by graph neural networks (GNN). The fusion layer optimizes an integration between collaborative features of global images and cell graphs. Two fusion strategies have been developed: one with MLP which is simple but turns out efficient through fine-tuning, and the other with Transformer gains a champion in fusing multiple networks. We evaluate our fusion strategies on histology datasets curated from large patient cohorts of colorectal and gastric cancers for three biomarker prediction tasks. Both two models outperform plain CNNs or GNNs, reaching a consistent AUC improvement of more than 5% on various network backbones. The experimental results yield the necessity for combining image-level morphological features with cell spatial relations in medical image analysis.

If so, what are the advantages and drawbacks of switching to ViTs for medical image diagnosis? We consider these questions in a series of experiments on three mainstream medical image datasets.

Edges and boundaries encode shape information, while textures manifest the appearance of regions. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision and medical image analysis applications, predominantly only texture abstractions are learned, which often leads to imprecise boundary delineations. In medical imaging, expert manual segmentation often relies on organ boundaries; for example, to manually segment a liver, a medical practitioner usually identifies edges first and subsequently fills in the segmentation mask. Motivated by these observations, we propose a plug-and-play module, dubbed Edge-Gated CNNs (EG-CNNs), that can be used with existing encoder-decoder architectures to process both edge and texture information. The EG-CNN learns to emphasize the edges in the encoder, to predict crisp boundaries by an auxiliary edge supervision, and to fuse its output with the original CNN output. We evaluate the effectiveness of the EG-CNN with various mainstream CNNs on two publicly available datasets, BraTS 19 and KiTS 19 for brain tumor and kidney semantic segmentation.

In this paper, we mine and harvest one major type of clinical annotation data - lesion diameters annotated on bookmarked images - to learn an effective multi-class lesion detector via unsupervised and supervised deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our dataset is composed of 33,688 bookmarked radiology images from 10,825 studies of 4,477 unique patients. For every bookmarked image, a bounding box is created to cover the target lesion based on its measured diameters. We categorize the collection of lesions using an unsupervised deep mining scheme to generate clustered pseudo lesion labels. Next, we adopt a regional-CNN method to detect lesions of multiple categories, regardless of missing annotations (normally only one lesion is annotated, despite the presence of multiple co-existing findings). Our integrated mining, categorization and detection framework is validated with promising empirical results, as a scalable, universal or multi-purpose CAD paradigm built upon abundant retrospective medical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that detection accuracy can be significantly improved by incorporating pseudo lesion labels (e.g., Liver lesion/tumor, Lung nodule/tumor, Abdomen lesions, Chest lymph node and others).

We first present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the fusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability. We then introduce a new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN that aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities. We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in the worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate of 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space.

We find that the main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text outputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with errors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of the ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key sentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words, which makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of multimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the sentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically refine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues. Specifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to obtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then utilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine the sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual inputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets including MOSI-Speechbrain, MOSI-IBM, and MOSI-iFlytek and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art models on three datasets.

We first present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the fusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability.

We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in the worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate of 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space.

The forward propagation is thus equal to the information transmission in the channels. Then, we can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the effect of different fusion approaches. We argue the optimal fusion architecture is related to the essential capacity and its allocation based on the source and channel. To test this multimodal fusion hypothesis, we progressively determine a series of multimodal models based on the proposed fusion methods and evaluate them on the KITTI and the A2D2 datasets. Our optimal fusion network achieves 85%+ lane line accuracy and 98.7%+ overall. The performance gap among the models will inform continuing future research into development of optimal fusion algorithms for the deep multimodal learning community.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11114v1\", \"timestamp\": 1616222878, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"4ddaba32-d4b5-4c30-a523-c29243e1a975\", \"authors\": [\"Yulun Du\", \"Chirag Raman\", \"Alan W Black\", \"Louis-Philippe Morency\", \"Maxine Eskenazi\"], \"title\": \"Multimodal Polynomial Fusion for Detecting Driver Distraction\", \"abstract\": \"Distracted driving is deadly, claiming 3,477 lives in the U.S. in 2015 alone.

Improved detection of protective behaviors can lead to better patient outcomes and more effective interventions. This research could pave the way for future studies on multimodal integration, enhancing our understanding of complex datasets and their applications in real-world scenarios, such as pain management and emotional health.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in this research stem from the complexity of integrating diverse modalities and ensuring that the statistical weighting accurately reflects the importance of each modality. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate relationships between modalities and the potential for noise in the data. Additionally, achieving a balance between model complexity and interpretability poses a significant obstacle, as does the need for robust validation across various deep learning architectures.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on single-modality approaches or simplistic fusion techniques that do not account for the nuanced interactions between modalities. Limitations in computational resources and the lack of comprehensive datasets have also hindered progress. Our approach differs by introducing a customizable framework that utilizes statistical relevance weights and human-centric movement characteristics, which have not been adequately explored in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates statistical correlation analysis with human-centered insights. We will utilize the EmoPain dataset, which includes various modalities such as body joint coordinates and electromyography data. The metrics for evaluation will include classification accuracy and model robustness. We expect our approach to demonstrate superior performance in detecting protective behaviors, contributing to the development of explainable AI in healthcare and setting new standards for multimodal fusion techniques.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 148117, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4, "agent4": 3, "agent5": 4, "agent6": 4, "agent7": 4, "agent8": 4, "agent9": 4}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks

interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose

Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using

For ex-\nample, in medical imaging, models trained on the data from one institution may\nnot generalize well to another institution with different imaging hardware.

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata.

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata.

To tackle unsupervised lifelong ReID, we conduct a contrastive rehearsal on a small number of stored old samples while sequentially adapting to new domains.

A successful approach could enhance model generalization across diverse environments, leading to improved performance in critical applications. This research could pave the way for future studies on domain adaptation techniques, potentially influencing the development of more robust models that can adapt to changing conditions without extensive retraining.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the absence of continuous metadata to guide the adaptation process, making it difficult to determine the optimal transfer order of intermediate domains. Additionally, cumulative errors can accumulate during the adaptation process, leading to degraded model performance. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the complex relationships between domains or the need for a structured adaptation strategy that minimizes error propagation.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either adapting to a specific domain or generalizing to unseen domains, but not both simultaneously. Existing methods often assume access to complete target domain data during adaptation, which is unrealistic in many practical scenarios. Our approach aims to address these limitations by proposing a model-agnostic framework that integrates domain adaptation and generalization, allowing for continuous adaptation without the need for complete metadata.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel framework that combines complementary domain adaptation and generalization techniques. We will utilize benchmark datasets that reflect real-world domain shifts and evaluate our model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and generalization error. The expected outcome is a robust model capable of adapting to new domains while retaining knowledge from previous domains, ultimately demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in continuous domain adaptation scenarios.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

(2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples.

The effectiveness of the proposed unlearning inversion attacks is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various model architectures and on both exact and approximate representative unlearning approaches.

Traditionally, the development of unlearning algorithms runs parallel with that of membership inference attacks (MIA), a type of privacy threat to determine whether a data instance was used for training. However, the two strands are intimately connected: one can view machine unlearning through the lens of MIA success with respect to removed data. Recognizing this connection, we propose a game-theoretic framework that integrates MIAs into the design of unlearning algorithms. Specifically, we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs to detect the traces of the ostensibly removed data. Adopting this adversarial perspective allows the utilization of new attack advancements, facilitating the design of unlearning algorithms. Our framework stands out in two ways. First, it takes an adversarial approach and proactively incorporates the attacks into the design of unlearning algorithms. Secondly, it uses implicit differentiation to obtain the gradients that limit the attacker's success, thus benefiting the process of unlearning.

These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their \\\"U-MIA\\\" counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into \\\"population U-MIAs\\\", where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and \\\"per-example U-MIAs\\\", where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples.

Traditionally, the development of unlearning algorithms runs parallel with that of membership inference attacks (MIA), a type of privacy threat to determine whether a data instance was used for training. However, the two strands are intimately connected: one can view machine unlearning through the lens of MIA success with respect to removed data. Recognizing this connection, we propose a game-theoretic framework that integrates MIAs into the design of unlearning algorithms. Specifically, we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs to detect the traces of the ostensibly removed data. Adopting this adversarial perspective allows the utilization of new attack advancements, facilitating the design of unlearning algorithms. Our framework stands out in two ways. First, it takes an adversarial approach and proactively incorporates the attacks into the design of unlearning algorithms.

Improving unlearning methods can lead to better compliance with privacy regulations, such as the right to be forgotten, and enhance user trust in AI systems. This research could pave the way for more secure and efficient unlearning algorithms, influencing future studies on adversarial robustness and privacy in machine learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the dual requirement of effectively removing specific knowledge from LLMs while simultaneously preventing adversaries from exploiting vulnerabilities during the unlearning process. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the complex interactions between retained and forgotten knowledge, which can lead to unintended information leakage. Additionally, the theoretical understanding of how unlearning impacts model behavior and adversarial robustness is still underdeveloped, complicating the design of effective solutions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on the efficacy of unlearning methods without adequately addressing the security implications of these techniques.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nText-to-image generative models have witnessed significant advancements in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\n\nRobot learning has made inspiring progress in recent years, resulting in robots that can cook\u00a0[1], clean up\u00a0[2], or even perform backflips\u00a0[3]. While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

With this ball launcher, we enable long-duration training of robot table tennis approaches where the complexity of the ball trajectory can be automatically adjusted, enabling large-scale real-world online reinforcement learning for table tennis robots.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06048v3\", \"timestamp\": 1665567460, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ab64ed2b-e15e-41ff-b2c2-d89347557c6f\", \"authors\": [\"Andreas Ziegler\", \"Thomas Gossard\", \"Karl Vetter\", \"Jonas Tebbe\", \"Andreas Zell\"], \"title\": \"A multi-modal table tennis robot system\", \"abstract\": \"In recent years, robotic table tennis has become a popular research challenge for perception and robot control.

Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15528v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727123211, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7c6c7dc3-1a75-4719-a371-7d79390d3336\", \"authors\": [\"Dieter B\\u00fcchler\", \"Simon Guist\", \"Roberto Calandra\", \"Vincent Berenz\", \"Bernhard Sch\\u00f6lkopf\", \"Jan Peters\"], \"title\": \"Learning to Play Table Tennis From Scratch using Muscular Robots\", \"abstract\": \"Dynamic tasks like table tennis are relatively easy to learn for humans but pose significant challenges to robots. Such tasks require accurate control of fast movements and precise timing in the presence of imprecise state estimation of the flying ball and the robot. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in learning of complex control tasks from data. However, applying step-based RL to dynamic tasks on real systems is safety-critical as RL requires exploring and failing safely for millions of time steps in high-speed regimes. In this paper, we demonstrate that safe learning of table tennis using model-free Reinforcement Learning can be achieved by using robot arms driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). Softness and back-drivability properties of PAMs prevent the system from leaving the safe region of its state space. In this manner, RL empowers the robot to return and smash real balls with 5 m\\\\s and 12m\\\\s on average to a desired landing point. Our setup allows the agent to learn this safety-critical task (i) without safety constraints in the algorithm, (ii) while maximizing the speed of returned balls directly in the reward function (iii) using a stochastic policy that acts directly on the low-level controls of the real system and (iv) trains for thousands of trials (v) from scratch without any prior knowledge. Additionally, we present HYSR, a practical hybrid sim and real training that avoids playing real balls during training by randomly replaying recorded ball trajectories in simulation and applying actions to the real robot. This work is the first to (a) fail-safe learn of a safety-critical dynamic task using anthropomorphic robot arms, (b) learn a precision-demanding problem with a PAM-driven system despite the control challenges and (c) train robots to play table tennis without real balls.

Most of these successes are based on having large numbers of episodes from which the agent can learn. In typical robotic applications, however, the number of feasible attempts is very limited. In this paper we present a sample-efficient RL algorithm applied to the example of a table tennis robot. In table tennis every stroke is different, with varying placement, speed and spin. An accurate return therefore has to be found depending on a high-dimensional continuous state space. To make learning in few trials possible the method is embedded into our robot system. In this way we can use a one-step environment. The state space depends on the ball at hitting time (position, velocity, spin) and the action is the racket state (orientation, velocity) at hitting. An actor-critic based deterministic policy gradient algorithm was developed for accelerated learning.

Achieving human-level performance in a physically demanding sport like table tennis can lead to advancements in robotic control, real-time decision-making, and adaptive strategies. This research could inspire future studies in other complex sports and applications, enhancing the capabilities of robots in various fields, including healthcare, manufacturing, and service industries.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in this problem stem from the need for high-speed motion, precise control, and real-time decision-making in a dynamic environment. Unlike static games, table tennis requires the robot to adapt to varying ball speeds, spins, and trajectories while also considering the opponent's strategies. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of the task, including the need for accurate state estimation and the ability to execute physical skills under uncertainty. Additionally, the robot must balance strategic decision-making with the execution of physical actions, which adds layers of complexity to the learning process.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on specific aspects of table tennis, such as ball return or targeted hitting, without addressing the full competitive game against human players. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive training environments that simulate real match conditions and the inability to adapt to unseen opponents. Our approach differs by proposing a hierarchical and modular policy architecture that integrates low-level skill policies with a high-level controller, enabling the robot to learn and adapt in real-time to various opponents and match scenarios.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hierarchical policy architecture that includes multiple low-level skill policies (e.g., forehand topspin, backhand targeting) and a high-level controller that selects the appropriate skill based on the match context. We will utilize a combination of simulation and real-world training data to enhance the robot's learning efficiency. The expected outcomes include the robot's ability to compete effectively against human players, demonstrating adaptability and strategic decision-making in real-time.

The usual unsupervised anomaly detection approach is to train a model for each object class using a dataset of normal samples. However, a more realistic problem is zero-/few-shot anomaly detection where zero or only a few normal samples are available. This makes the training of object-specific models challenging. Recently, large foundation vision-language models have shown strong zero-shot performance in various downstream tasks. While these models have learned complex relationships between vision and language, they are not specifically designed for the tasks of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose the Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine (FADE) which leverages the vision-language CLIP model and adjusts it for the purpose of industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, we improve language-guided anomaly segmentation 1) by adapting CLIP to extract multi-scale image patch embeddings that are better aligned with language and 2) by automatically generating an ensemble of text prompts related to industrial anomaly detection. 3) We use additional vision-based guidance from the query and reference images to further improve both zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection. On the MVTec-AD (and VisA) dataset, FADE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in anomaly segmentation with pixel-AUROC of 89.6% (91.5%) in zero-shot and 95.4% (97.5%) in 1-normal-shot.

The translation from noninvasive brain signals into readable natural language has the potential to promote the application scenario as well as the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as a whole. The critical problem in brain signal decoding or brain-to-language translation is the acquisition of semantically appropriate and discriminative EEG representation from a dataset of limited scale and quality. The proposed BELT method is a generic and efficient framework that bootstraps EEG representation learning using off-the-shelf large-scale pretrained language models (LMs). With a large LM's capacity for understanding semantic information and zero-shot generalization, BELT utilizes large LMs trained on Internet-scale datasets to bring significant improvements to the understanding of EEG signals.   In particular, the BELT model is composed of a deep conformer encoder and a vector quantization encoder. Semantical EEG representation is achieved by a contrastive learning step that provides natural language supervision. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two featuring brain decoding tasks including the brain-to-language translation and zero-shot sentiment classification.

Those techniques can give us prominent results by using only a few training sets reducing the required amounts of data and improving the generalization.

SL-HyDE leverages large language models (LLMs) as generators to generate hypothetical documents based on a given query. These generated documents encapsulate key medical context, guiding a dense retriever in identifying the most relevant documents.

Additionally, we present the Chinese Medical Information Retrieval Benchmark (CMIRB), a comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in real-world medical scenarios, encompassing five tasks and ten datasets. By benchmarking ten models on CMIRB, we establish a rigorous standard for evaluating medical information retrieval systems.

In this paper, we evaluate the \\\"implicit\\\" retrieval robustness of various large language models, instructing them to directly output the final answer without explicitly judging the relevance of the retrieved context. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning on a mix of gold and distracting context significantly enhances the model's robustness to retrieval inaccuracies, while still maintaining its ability to extract correct answers when retrieval is accurate.

This is a limitation, as semantic search, the widely adopted tool retrieval method, can fail when the query is incomplete or lacks context. To address this limitation, we propose Context Tuning for RAG, which employs a smart context retrieval system to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan generation. Our lightweight context retrieval model uses numerical, categorical, and habitual usage signals to retrieve and rank context items. Our empirical results demonstrate that context tuning significantly enhances semantic search, achieving a 3.5-fold and 1.5-fold improvement in Recall@K for context retrieval and tool retrieval tasks respectively, and resulting in an 11.6% increase in LLM-based planner accuracy.

Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can be inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for each query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddings from Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF proposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation task, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest neighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs domain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant. Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single token, thereby improving search latency.

To evaluate our different integration strategies, we transform four existing information retrieval datasets into the relevance feedback scenario.

Our experiments on three public verification datasets show that ProToCo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot fact verification baselines. With a small number of unlabeled instances, ProToCo also outperforms the strong zero-shot learner T0 on zero-shot verification.

This advancement could lead to significant improvements in tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval, ultimately benefiting industries that rely on natural language understanding. A successful approach could pave the way for future research into more efficient training methodologies and applications in low-resource settings.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of few-shot learning, where models must effectively learn from a minimal amount of data without overfitting. Naive approaches may fail due to the models' tendency to rely on memorization rather than generalization. Additionally, the lack of labeled data in many domains complicates the training process, requiring innovative strategies to leverage existing knowledge effectively. Technical obstacles include optimizing model architectures and training processes to balance performance and computational efficiency.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on traditional supervised learning paradigms, which require extensive labeled datasets, limiting the exploration of few-shot learning techniques. Additionally, many existing models do not adequately address the nuances of in-context learning or fail to leverage the full potential of LLMs in few-shot scenarios. Our approach aims to integrate in-context learning distillation and task-specific adaptations, which have not been thoroughly explored in prior work, thus providing a novel perspective on enhancing few-shot learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a framework that combines in-context learning objectives with language modeling objectives to distill knowledge from larger models to smaller ones. We will utilize datasets from various NLP tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, measuring performance through metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in few-shot learning performance across multiple tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our integrated approach and potentially setting new benchmarks in the field.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 85332, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 3, "agent4": 4, "agent5": 5}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 3, "feasibility": 4}}

Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval. The latter will be detailed further in Section \u00a02.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in candidate sets (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly, utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements. As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\nIn contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing various feature interaction operators, such as product operators\u00a0(Qu et\u00a0al., 2016), convolutional operators\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2019a), and attention operators\u00a0(Xiao et\u00a0al., 2017).

Cascade architecture, composed of retrieval, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, is usually adopted to reduce the computational cost. Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and calculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs. The multi-stage ranking strategy causes a new problem - the ranked lists of the ranking stage and previous stages may be inconsistent. For example, items that should be ranked at the top of the ranking stage may be ranked at the bottom of previous stages. In this paper, we focus on the \\\\textbf{ranking consistency} between the pre-ranking and ranking stages.

We demonstrate that ranking consistency has a direct impact on online performance. Compared with the traditional evaluation manner that mainly focuses on the individual ranking quality of every objective, RCS considers the ranking consistency of the fused final objective, which is more proper for evaluation. Finally, to improve the ranking consistency, we propose several methods from the perspective of sample selection and learning algorithms.

In the retrieval stage, multi-channel retrieval is often used to generate distinct item subsets from different candidate generators, leveraging the complementary strengths of these methods to maximize coverage.

As the early and final stage ranking use different features and model architectures because of system constraints, a serious ranking consistency issue arises where the early stage has a low ads recall, i.e., top ads in the final stage are ranked low in the early stage.

Technical obstacles include the need for robust metrics to evaluate ranking consistency and the difficulty in designing models that can effectively bridge the gap between the two stages without incurring significant computational costs.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either the retrieval or ranking stages, often neglecting the critical interactions between them. Existing solutions may lack a comprehensive framework that addresses the entire cascade process, leading to sample selection bias and suboptimal performance. Our approach aims to integrate insights from both stages, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance collaboration between the retriever and ranker, which has not been adequately explored in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a multi-task learning framework that captures the relationships between the pre-ranking and ranking stages, utilizing a shared representation to improve ranking consistency. The methodology will involve training on large-scale datasets from real-world recommender systems, employing metrics such as Ranking Consistency Score (RCS) to evaluate performance. Expected outcomes include improved ranking consistency, higher click-through rates, and enhanced user satisfaction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in practical applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 88349, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 7, "agent2": 7, "agent3": 7, "agent4": 7, "agent5": 6}, "total_milestones": 7, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Our framework automatically constructs fine-grained training labels tailored for a classifier obtained with empirical risk minimization to improve its robustness against spurious correlations. The fine-grained training labels are formulated with different prediction behaviors of the classifier identified in a novel spuriousness embedding space. We construct the space with automatically detected conceptual attributes and a novel spuriousness metric which measures how likely a class-attribute correlation is exploited for predictions.

Our study reveals that when pre-trained on a sufficiently large dataset, ViT models are more robust to spurious correlations than CNNs. Key to their success is the ability to generalize better from the examples where spurious correlations do not hold.

However, most models developed under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical correlations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable correlation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training distribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution data by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE could successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable contribution of historical records for predictions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01321v1\", \"timestamp\": 1662178245, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b4467bc2-d048-4495-a2ce-46bdeb0cebe1\", \"authors\": [\"Nilesh Kumar\", \"Ruby Shrestha\", \"Zhiyuan Li\", \"Linwei Wang\"], \"title\": \"Distributionally Robust Optimization and Invariant Representation Learning for Addressing Subgroup Underrepresentation: Mechanisms and Limitations\", \"abstract\": \"Spurious correlation caused by subgroup underrepresentation has received increasing attention as a source of bias that can be perpetuated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Distributionally robust optimization has shown success in addressing this bias, although the underlying working mechanism mostly relies on upweighting under-performing samples as surrogates for those underrepresented in data. At the same time, while invariant representation learning has been a powerful choice for removing nuisance-sensitive features, it has been little considered in settings where spurious correlations are caused by significant underrepresentation of subgroups. In this paper, we take the first step to better understand and improve the mechanisms for debiasing spurious correlation due to subgroup underrepresentation in medical image classification. Through a comprehensive evaluation study, we first show that 1) generalized reweighting of under-performing samples can be problematic when bias is not the only cause for poor performance, while 2) naive invariant representation learning suffers from spurious correlations itself. We then present a novel approach that leverages robust optimization to facilitate the learning of invariant representations at the presence of spurious correlations.

We demonstrate that our method is robust to spurious correlations without knowing them a priori and achieves the best on five benchmark datasets with different robustness measures.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10742v1\", \"timestamp\": 1718487685, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"4daf14a2-2b6f-4e1e-ab4c-33ba4f4a5517\", \"authors\": [\"Guangtao Zheng\", \"Wenqian Ye\", \"Aidong Zhang\"], \"title\": \"Learning Robust Classifiers with Self-Guided Spurious Correlation Mitigation\", \"abstract\": \"Deep neural classifiers tend to rely on spurious correlations between spurious attributes of inputs and targets to make predictions, which could jeopardize their generalization capability.

Our framework automatically constructs fine-grained training labels tailored for a classifier obtained with empirical risk minimization to improve its robustness against spurious correlations. The fine-grained training labels are formulated with different prediction behaviors of the classifier identified in a novel spuriousness embedding space. We construct the space with automatically detected conceptual attributes and a novel spuriousness metric which measures how likely a class-attribute correlation is exploited for predictions.

Our study reveals that when pre-trained on a sufficiently large dataset, ViT models are more robust to spurious correlations than CNNs.

However, most models developed under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical correlations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable correlation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training distribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution data by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE could successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable contribution of historical records for predictions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01321v1\", \"timestamp\": 1662178245, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f4dc044b-c233-4c26-a098-e8249913af10\", \"authors\": [\"Nilesh Kumar\", \"Ruby Shrestha\", \"Zhiyuan Li\", \"Linwei Wang\"], \"title\": \"Distributionally Robust Optimization and Invariant Representation Learning for Addressing Subgroup Underrepresentation: Mechanisms and Limitations\", \"abstract\": \"Spurious correlation caused by subgroup underrepresentation has received increasing attention as a source of bias that can be perpetuated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Distributionally robust optimization has shown success in addressing this bias, although the underlying working mechanism mostly relies on upweighting under-performing samples as surrogates for those underrepresented in data. At the same time, while invariant representation learning has been a powerful choice for removing nuisance-sensitive features, it has been little considered in settings where spurious correlations are caused by significant underrepresentation of subgroups. In this paper, we take the first step to better understand and improve the mechanisms for debiasing spurious correlation due to subgroup underrepresentation in medical image classification. Through a comprehensive evaluation study, we first show that 1) generalized reweighting of under-performing samples can be problematic when bias is not the only cause for poor performance, while 2) naive invariant representation learning suffers from spurious correlations itself.

A solution could significantly impact various fields, including computer vision and healthcare, by improving model reliability and fairness. This research could pave the way for future studies on unsupervised learning techniques and their applications in diverse datasets, ultimately leading to more robust AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of identifying and mitigating spurious correlations without explicit annotations. Naive approaches may fail because they might not adequately capture the nuanced relationships between features and labels, leading to overfitting on spurious correlations. Additionally, the lack of a clear metric for measuring spuriousness complicates the development of effective training strategies. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can dynamically adapt to the data's characteristics.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research often relied on annotated datasets to identify spurious correlations, which is impractical in many scenarios. Existing solutions may not adequately address the variability in data distributions or the complexity of feature interactions. Our approach differs by proposing a self-guided framework that constructs fine-grained training labels automatically, allowing for a more flexible and scalable solution to the problem of spurious correlations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a two-stage process: first, we will implement a self-guided spurious correlation mitigation framework that constructs training labels based on the classifier's prediction behaviors in a spuriousness embedding space. Second, we will utilize importance sampling to train a robust classifier that leverages these labels. We plan to evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets such as CMNIST and CelebA, measuring performance improvements in robustness against spurious correlations.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability necessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the limitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) strategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog and digital methods. Addressing this need, this paper introduces a novel hybrid DeepJSCC framework, h-DJSCC, tailored for effective image transmission from edge devices through a network architecture that includes initial wireless transmission followed by multiple wired hops. Our approach harnesses the strengths of DeepJSCC for the initial, variable-quality wireless link to avoid the cliff effect inherent in purely digital schemes. For the subsequent wired hops, which feature more stable and high-capacity connections, we implement digital compression and forwarding techniques to prevent noise accumulation. This dual-mode strategy is adaptable even in scenarios with limited knowledge of the image distribution, enhancing the framework's robustness and utility. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our hybrid solution outperforms traditional fully digital approaches by effectively managing transitions between different network segments and optimizing for variable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The average network performance depends on the choice of the modulation index, the number of frequency-hopping channels, and the fractional in-band power, which are assumed to be fixed network parameters. The performance of a given transmission depends on the code rate, which is adapted in response to the interference to meet a constraint on outage probability. The optimization proceeds by choosing a set of fixed network parameters, drawing the interferers from the spatial distribution, and determining the maximum rate that satisfies the outage constraint.

Our experiments have shown that SIJSCC outperforms existing channel adaptive DL-based JSCC methods that rely on SNR information. Furthermore, we found that SNR estimation does not significantly benefit SIJSCC, which provides insights for the future design of DL-based JSCC methods.

Nonetheless, the majority of existing DL-based JSCC methods are tailored for scenarios featuring stable channel conditions, notably a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This specialization poses a limitation, as their performance tends to wane in practical scenarios marked by highly dynamic channels, given that a fixed SNR inadequately represents the dynamic nature of such channels. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel solution, namely deep refinement-based JSCC (DRJSCC). This innovative method is designed to seamlessly adapt to channels exhibiting temporal variations. By leveraging instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we dynamically optimize the encoding strategy through re-encoding the channel symbols. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the encoding strategy consistently aligns with the varying channel conditions during the transmission process. Specifically, our approach begins with the division of encoded symbols into multiple blocks, which are transmitted progressively to the receiver. In the event of changing channel conditions, we propose a mechanism to re-encode the remaining blocks, allowing them to adapt to the current channel conditions.

A unified framework could lead to significant improvements in the quality of restored images across diverse applications, such as old photo restoration, medical imaging, and surveillance. This research could pave the way for future studies to explore more complex degradation scenarios and enhance the robustness of image restoration techniques, ultimately benefiting both academia and industry.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent variability of real-world image degradations, which can be complex and unpredictable. Naive approaches may fail because they typically assume a specific degradation model, limiting their applicability. Additionally, the need for a model that can adapt to various unknown degradations introduces technical complexities, such as the requirement for advanced generative capabilities and the integration of multiple restoration techniques. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can dynamically adjust to different degradation types while maintaining high restoration quality.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on specific degradation types, leading to methods that lack generalization to unknown degradations. Many existing solutions are either too rigid or overly reliant on predefined models, which restricts their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the integration of advanced generative models, such as diffusion models, into BIR frameworks has not been fully explored. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging the strengths of generative diffusion models while developing a flexible architecture that can adapt to various degradation scenarios.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a two-stage process: (1) degradation removal, where we utilize advanced restoration modules to eliminate image-independent content, and (2) information regeneration, where we employ generative models to reconstruct lost image details. We will use diverse datasets that include both synthetic and real-world images to evaluate our framework's performance. Key metrics for assessment will include PSNR, SSIM, and visual fidelity.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Currently, deep neural networks struggle to generalize robustly to such shifts in the data distribution. We study robust generalization in the context of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn regular languages. We hypothesize that standard end-to-end modeling strategies cannot generalize well to systematic distribution shifts and propose a compositional strategy to address this. We compare an end-to-end strategy that maps strings to labels with a compositional strategy that predicts the structure of the deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) that accepts the regular language. We theoretically prove that the compositional strategy generalizes significantly better than the end-to-end strategy. In our experiments, we implement the compositional strategy via an auxiliary task where the goal is to predict the intermediate states visited by the DFA when parsing a string. Our empirical results support our hypothesis, showing that auxiliary tasks can enable robust generalization. Interestingly, the end-to-end RNN generalizes significantly better than the theoretical lower bound, suggesting that it is able to achieve at least some degree of robust generalization.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09717v1\", \"timestamp\": 1645325409, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"09d7f6c7-cb43-41d4-8f61-0c895d259f71\", \"authors\": [\"Sungjun Han\", \"Sebastian Pad\\u00f3\"], \"title\": \"Towards Understanding the Relationship between In-context Learning and Compositional Generalization\", \"abstract\": \"According to the principle of compositional generalization, the meaning of a complex expression can be understood as a function of the meaning of its parts and of how they are combined. This principle is crucial for human language processing and also, arguably, for NLP models in the face of out-of-distribution data. However, many neural network models, including Transformers, have been shown to struggle with compositional generalization. In this paper, we hypothesize that forcing models to in-context learn can provide an inductive bias to promote compositional generalization. To test this hypothesis, we train a causal Transformer in a setting that renders ordinary learning very difficult: we present it with different orderings of the training instance and shuffle instance labels. This corresponds to training the model on all possible few-shot learning problems attainable from the dataset. The model can solve the task, however, by utilizing earlier examples to generalize to later ones (i.e. in-context learning). In evaluations on the datasets, SCAN, COGS, and GeoQuery, models trained in this manner indeed show improved compositional generalization.

We apply the proposed approach to language comprehension task by using Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE). Our NSE models achieve the state-of-the-art results showing an absolute improvement of 1.2% to 2.6% accuracy over previous results obtained by single and ensemble systems on standard machine comprehension benchmarks such as the Children's Book Test (CBT) and Who-Did-What (WDW) news article datasets.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06454v2\", \"timestamp\": 1476976624, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9edaac2a-9176-4c98-b109-a2b2ca61c1aa\", \"authors\": [\"Luca Buratti\", \"Saurabh Pujar\", \"Mihaela Bornea\", \"Scott McCarley\", \"Yunhui Zheng\", \"Gaetano Rossiello\", \"Alessandro Morari\", \"Jim Laredo\", \"Veronika Thost\", \"Yufan Zhuang\", \"Giacomo Domeniconi\"], \"title\": \"Exploring Software Naturalness through Neural Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"The Software Naturalness hypothesis argues that programming languages can be understood through the same techniques used in natural language processing.

Specifically, we trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on the `IMDb' AI benchmark dataset, then measured the neuron activations. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on the time series of the different neurons demonstrate clear $1/f$ patterns, which is absent in the time series of the inputs to the LSTM.

It could lead to the development of neural networks that exhibit more human-like understanding and reasoning capabilities, thereby enhancing applications in artificial intelligence, such as improved image recognition, natural language processing, and cognitive computing. This research could bridge the gap between cognitive science and machine learning, influencing future research directions and methodologies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent differences between linguistic and non-linguistic data. While language models can leverage the structured nature of language, images and other non-linguistic data do not have an explicit compositional structure.

Additionally, developing a model that can generalize well across different datasets and tasks while maintaining compositionality and productivity is technically complex.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either linguistic data or specific aspects of visual representation, often neglecting the integration of both.

(2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been introduced to the planning processes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy for prostate, lung, and cervical cancers. However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create auxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs), along with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver cancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to other treatment sites.

Given a high-level task description in natural language, the proposed method queries a language model to generate plans in the form of executable robot programs.

We compute optimal routes for automated vehicles by solving optimal policies in the POMDP planning, and evaluate the resulting routes via human subject experiments with 22 participants on a driving simulator. The experimental results show that participants taking the trust-based route generally reported more positive responses in the after-driving survey than those taking the baseline (trust-free) route.

We tackle this planning issue by extending the policy gradient theory to policy updates with respect to any state density. Under these generalized policy updates, we show convergence to optimality under a necessary and sufficient condition on the updates' state densities, and thereby solve the aforementioned planning issue. We also prove asymptotic convergence rates that significantly improve those in the policy gradient literature.   To implement the principles prescribed by our theory, we propose an agent, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde (JH), with a double personality: Dr Jekyll purely exploits while Mr Hyde purely explores. JH's independent policies allow to record two separate replay buffers: one on-policy (Dr Jekyll's) and one off-policy (Mr Hyde's), and therefore to update JH's models with a mixture of on-policy and off-policy updates.

Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as they incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies directly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can successfully plan across different environments. However none of the existing NMPs generalize across robot embodiments. In this paper we propose Cross-Embodiment Motion Policy (XMoP), a neural policy for learning to plan over a distribution of manipulators. XMoP implicitly learns to satisfy kinematic constraints for a distribution of robots and $\\\\textit{zero-shot}$ transfers the planning behavior to unseen robotic manipulators within this distribution. We achieve this generalization by formulating a whole-body control policy that is trained on planning demonstrations from over three million procedurally sampled robotic manipulators in different simulated environments. Despite being completely trained on synthetic embodiments and environments, our policy exhibits strong sim-to-real generalization across manipulators with different kinematic variations and degrees of freedom with a single set of frozen policy parameters. We evaluate XMoP on $7$ commercial manipulators and show successful cross-embodiment motion planning, achieving an average $70\\\\%$ success rate on baseline benchmarks.

Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job creation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its transformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can adopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering the causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way, entrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and analysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies causal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative innovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the entrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious gap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the entrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity, proactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour influence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we analysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities in southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation methodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results show, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship learning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in the field of entrepreneurial intentions. Considering propensity towards causal behaviour before setting up the firm is unprecedented. Furthermore, the results of this study have practical implications for the design of public education policies and the promotion of business creation in the tourism sector.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00517v1\", \"timestamp\": 1701431182, \"domain\": \"econ.GN\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2abcd5fd-5b30-4868-bb2b-09c88e9c6435\", \"authors\": [\"Xuan Liu\", \"Jie Fu\"], \"title\": \"Compositional planning in Markov decision processes: Temporal abstraction meets generalized logic composition\", \"abstract\": \"In hierarchical planning for Markov decision processes (MDPs), temporal abstraction allows planning with macro-actions that take place at different time scale in form of sequential composition.

However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create auxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs), along with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans.

This research could lead to more effective planning algorithms that can generalize across various domains, improving the performance of AI systems in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and complex decision-making scenarios. By enhancing the expressiveness of learned policies, future research can explore more sophisticated planning tasks that were previously infeasible.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent limitations of existing methods, such as the expressive power of C2 logic, which restricts the types of features that can be learned. Additionally, while 3-GNNs offer greater expressiveness, they suffer from scalability issues due to their cubic space and quartic time requirements for message passing. Naive approaches may fail because they do not adequately address the need for complex logical relationships in planning tasks, and overcoming these technical barriers requires innovative methodologies that balance expressiveness with computational efficiency.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either combinatorial approaches or deep learning methods, both of which are limited by their respective expressive capacities. The lack of recognition of the need for richer logical features in policy learning has hindered progress. Additionally, the computational demands of more expressive models like 3-GNNs have made them impractical for widespread use. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing a parameterized version of relational GNNs that can adaptively balance expressiveness and computational efficiency, thus providing a novel solution to the limitations of prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a parameterized version of relational GNNs (R-GNN[t]) that accepts transformed input states to enhance expressiveness while maintaining computational feasibility.

It has emerged as one of the most convenient and natural methods to interact with the web and is especially desirable in voice-controlled environments. Despite being one of the oldest research areas, the current QA system faces the critical challenge of handling multilingual queries. To build an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent that can serve multilingual end users, a QA system is required to be language versatile and tailored to suit the multilingual environment. Recent advances in QA models have enabled surpassing human performance primarily due to the availability of a sizable amount of high-quality datasets. However, the majority of such annotated datasets are expensive to create and are only confined to the English language, making it challenging to acknowledge progress in foreign languages. Therefore, to measure a similar improvement in the multilingual QA system, it is necessary to invest in high-quality multilingual evaluation benchmarks.

In the first part, we explore multilingualism and a new dimension of multilingualism referred to as code-mixing.

First, does multilingual transfer ability exist in English-centric models and how does it compare with multilingual pretrained models? Second, does it only appears when English is the source language for the English-centric model? Third, how does it vary in different tasks? We take multilingual reasoning ability as our focus and conduct extensive experiments across four types of reasoning tasks. We find that the multilingual pretrained model does not always outperform an English-centric model. Furthermore, English appears to be a less suitable source language, and the choice of source language becomes less important when the English-centric model scales up. In addition, different types of tasks exhibit different multilingual transfer abilities.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\nModels Drop rate AlpacaEval GSM8K MBPP Average\nLM +\nMath0.1 0.805 0.599 / 0.702\n0.3 0.812 0.629 / 0.721\n0.5 0.804 0.645 / 0.724\n0.7 0.787 0.611 / 0.699\n0.9 0.683 0.455 / 0.570\nLM +\nCode0.1 0.741 / 0 0.370\n0.3 0.770 / 0 0.385\n0.5 0.802 / 0.152 0.477\n0.7 0.798 / 0.34 0.569\n0.9 0.737 / 0.262 0.500\nMath +\nCode0.1 / 0.619 0.166 0.393\n0.3 / 0.618 0.184 0.401\n0.5 / 0.626 0.206 0.416\n0.7 / 0.633 0.19 0.412\n0.9 / 0.622 0.128 0.375\nLM +\nMath +\nCode0.1 0.732 0.545 0.114 0.464\n0.3 0.766 0.623 0.302 0.564\n0.5 0.794 0.630 0.3 0.575\n0.7 0.770 0.622 0.23 0.541\n0.9 0.688 0.446 0.128 0.421\nTable 7: Drop Rate of parameters against Task perfor-\nmance Appendix\nA.1 Importance of GPT4-as-a-judge for Math\ntasks - Example\nQuestion: Each person in a certain\nhousehold consumes 0.2 kg of rice ev-\nery meal.

A successful approach could lead to the development of more compact models that retain high performance, thereby reducing memory requirements and computational costs. This research could pave the way for future studies on model merging techniques, potentially influencing the design of more versatile AI systems capable of generalizing across different domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing the retention of essential delta parameters while minimizing interference during the merging process. Naive approaches may fail because they could either retain too many parameters, leading to redundancy and inefficiency, or drop too many, resulting in a loss of critical information necessary for maintaining task performance. Additionally, the complexity of determining the optimal drop rates and selection criteria for delta parameters adds to the difficulty of the problem.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on individual model fine-tuning without adequately addressing the complexities of merging multiple models. Existing solutions often overlook the nuanced interactions between delta parameters, leading to suboptimal performance. Our approach differs by introducing a systematic method for delta parameter selection and merging that leverages magnitude sampling and sign-based selection, which has not been thoroughly explored in prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves three key steps: (1) applying MAGPRUNE, a novel pruning method that samples delta parameters based on their magnitudes to reduce interference; (2) implementing sign-based delta parameter selection to further refine the merging process; and (3) fusing the selected delta parameters to create a merged model. We will evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets (AlpacaEval, GSM8K, MBPP) and compare performance metrics against existing methods like DARE.

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47].

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

Table 5 presents the sensitivity of parameter \u03b1on the Pubmed dataset.\nIt is observed that a relatively larger value of \u03b1, such as 10 or 50, leads to a significant improvement\nin performance. This finding further emphasizes the effectiveness of our proposed regularization Related Work\nLatent Graph Inference. Given only the node features of data, latent graph inference (LGI) aims to\nsimultaneously learn the underlying graph structure and discriminative node representations from the\nfeatures of data [10, 24, 39]. For example, Jiang et al. [15] propose to infer the graph structure by\ncombining graph learning and graph convolution in a unified framework. Yang et al. [45] model the\ntopology refinement as a label propagation process. Jin et al.

Therefore, many researchers have turned their attention to latent graph inference, specifically learning a parametric graph. To mitigate fluctuations in latent graph structure learning, this paper proposes a novel Boolean product-based graph residual connection in GNNs to link the latent graph and the original graph. It computes the Boolean product between the latent graph and the original graph at each layer to correct the learning process. The Boolean product between two adjacency matrices is equivalent to triangle detection.

Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to operate on point cloud data, dynamically learning the necessary graph structure. These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework, a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability techniques that track the gradient contributions of different latent graphs, shedding light on how our attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns to choose the appropriate latent space. In line with previous works, our experiments emphasize the advantages of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing performance. More importantly, our interpretability framework provides a general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces across different tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked in previous literature on latent graph inference.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11891v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700497463, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a831e914-a827-483e-9f01-6fc9e53f9682\", \"authors\": [\"Haitz S\\u00e1ez de Oc\\u00e1riz Borde\", \"Anastasis Kratsios\"], \"title\": \"Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries\", \"abstract\": \"The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003v1\", \"timestamp\": 1698073046, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve the performance and robustness of latent graph inference (LGI) models in scenarios where the underlying graph structure is incomplete or noisy?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nImproving LGI models is crucial as they enable the extraction of meaningful relationships from data that lacks explicit graph structures, which is common in real-world applications. Enhancing these models could lead to significant advancements in various fields, such as social network analysis, biological data interpretation, and recommendation systems. A successful approach could set a new standard for how GNNs handle incomplete data, influencing future research directions and practical implementations in machine learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in improving LGI models stem from the inherent complexity of accurately inferring graph structures from incomplete or noisy data. Naive approaches may fail due to overfitting to noise or underfitting due to missing connections. Additionally, the lack of a principled method for selecting optimal embedding spaces complicates the learning process. Technical obstacles include the need for robust algorithms that can adaptively learn graph structures while maintaining computational efficiency and theoretical soundness.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on static graph structures or has not adequately addressed the dynamic nature of graph inference in the presence of noise. Many existing models lack the flexibility to adaptively learn from varying data distributions or do not incorporate advanced geometric representations. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing a differentiable framework that selects optimal embedding spaces and incorporates robust learning mechanisms, thus improving upon prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel framework that integrates a differentiable embedding space selection mechanism with advanced latent graph inference techniques. We will utilize benchmark datasets such as Pubmed and S&P 500 stock price data to evaluate our model's performance. Key metrics will include accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency.

Most GCN-based methods consist of a graph filter or followed by a low-rank mapping optimized based on supervised training. However, we show two limitations suppressing the power of graph filtering: (1) Lack of generality. Due to the varied noise distribution, graph filters fail to denoise sparse data where noise is scattered across all frequencies, while supervised training results in worse performance on dense data where noise is concentrated in middle frequencies that can be removed by graph filters without training. (2) Lack of expressive power. We theoretically show that linear GCN (LGCN) that is effective on collaborative filtering (CF) cannot generate arbitrary embeddings, implying the possibility that optimal data representation might be unreachable.   To tackle the first limitation, we show close relation between noise distribution and the sharpness of spectrum where a sharper spectral distribution is more desirable causing data noise to be separable from important features without training. Based on this observation, we propose a generalized graph normalization G^2N to adjust the sharpness of spectral distribution in order to redistribute data noise to assure that it can be removed by graph filtering without training. As for the second limitation, we propose an individualized graph filter (IGF) adapting to the different confidence levels of the user preference that interactions can reflect, which is proved to be able to generate arbitrary embeddings. By simplifying LGCN, we further propose a simplified graph filtering (SGFCF) which only requires the top-K singular values for recommendation.

One classical approach in GCF is to learn user and item embeddings with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and utilize these embeddings for CF models. However, existing GCN-based methods are insufficient in generating satisfactory embeddings for CF models. This is because they fail to model complex node dependencies and variable relation dependencies from a given graph, making the learned embeddings fragile to uncover the root causes of user interests. In this work, we propose to integrate causal modeling with the learning process of GCN-based GCF models, leveraging causality-aware graph embeddings to capture complex causal relations in recommendations. We complete the task by 1) Causal Graph conceptualization, 2) Neural Causal Model parameterization and 3) Variational inference for Neural Causal Model.

Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function.

Most GCN-based methods consist of a graph filter or followed by a low-rank mapping optimized based on supervised training. However, we show two limitations suppressing the power of graph filtering: (1) Lack of generality. Due to the varied noise distribution, graph filters fail to denoise sparse data where noise is scattered across all frequencies, while supervised training results in worse performance on dense data where noise is concentrated in middle frequencies that can be removed by graph filters without training. (2) Lack of expressive power. We theoretically show that linear GCN (LGCN) that is effective on collaborative filtering (CF) cannot generate arbitrary embeddings, implying the possibility that optimal data representation might be unreachable.   To tackle the first limitation, we show close relation between noise distribution and the sharpness of spectrum where a sharper spectral distribution is more desirable causing data noise to be separable from important features without training. Based on this observation, we propose a generalized graph normalization G^2N to adjust the sharpness of spectral distribution in order to redistribute data noise to assure that it can be removed by graph filtering without training. As for the second limitation, we propose an individualized graph filter (IGF) adapting to the different confidence levels of the user preference that interactions can reflect, which is proved to be able to generate arbitrary embeddings. By simplifying LGCN, we further propose a simplified graph filtering (SGFCF) which only requires the top-K singular values for recommendation.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13168v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700630675, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3a812b47-a97e-4e09-9ff7-4bc6946e55a8\", \"authors\": [\"Zijiang Yang\", \"Zhongwei Qiu\", \"Chang Xu\", \"Dongmei Fu\"], \"title\": \"MM-NeRF: Multimodal-Guided 3D Multi-Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Field\", \"abstract\": \"3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data.

Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer.

Additionally, existing methods often struggle with issues such as blurriness, inconsistency in texture details, and the computational demands of training NeRF models on stylized images, which can lead to poor convergence and quality.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either 2D style transfer or 3D reconstruction without effectively integrating the two. Limitations include the reliance on explicit representations that require specialized skills and tools, as well as the challenges of achieving high-quality stylization with multi-view consistency. Many existing methods also involve complex iterative processes that can yield unpredictable results. Our approach aims to streamline this process by leveraging a style-aligned diffusion model to generate stylized images before fine-tuning the NeRF, thus addressing these gaps.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves training a NeRF model on stylized images generated by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. We will utilize Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss to guide the style transfer process effectively. The dataset will consist of various 3D scenes and corresponding stylized images, and we will evaluate the results based on visual quality and consistency across multiple views. Expected outcomes include the ability to generate high-quality, stylized 3D scenes that maintain artistic integrity and multi-view consistency, providing a robust tool for creators.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 73939, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 5, "agent4": 4}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.   Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020 Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning, Diagnosis and Detection leading to the extraction of 168 articles that ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Using deep models to realize automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset (2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19 diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

Inspired by Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), a common finding in COIVD-19 patient's CT scans, we proposed in this paper a novel self-supervised pretraining method based on pseudo lesions generation and restoration for COVID-19 diagnosis. We used Perlin noise, a gradient noise based mathematical model, to generate lesion-like patterns, which were then randomly pasted to the lung regions of normal CT images to generate pseudo COVID-19 images. The pairs of normal and pseudo COVID-19 images were then used to train an encoder-decoder architecture based U-Net for image restoration, which does not require any labelled data. The pretrained encoder was then fine-tuned using labelled data for COVID-19 diagnosis task. Two public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images were employed for evaluation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed self-supervised learning approach could extract better feature representation for COVID-19 diagnosis and the accuracy of the proposed method outperformed the supervised model pretrained on large scale images by 6.57% and 3.03% on SARS-CoV-2 dataset and Jinan COVID-19 dataset, respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12313v1\", \"timestamp\": 1624447290, \"domain\": \"eess.IV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"4e8b5e7f-f29c-4087-9fad-846f0695c2c1\", \"authors\": [\"Yujin Oh\", \"Sangjoon Park\", \"Jong Chul Ye\"], \"title\": \"Deep Learning COVID-19 Features on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets\", \"abstract\": \"Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important.

Concerning the novelty of the disease, the diagnostic methods based on radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.   Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020 Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning, Diagnosis and Detection leading to the extraction of 168 articles that ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: This review study provides an overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19 through radiology modalities and their processing based on deep learning. According to the finding, Deep learning Based models have an extraordinary capacity to achieve an accurate and efficient system for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, which using of them in the processing of CT-Scan and X-Ray images, would lead to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values.

Using deep models to realize automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset (2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19 diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

Enhanced diagnostic methods can lead to better patient outcomes and more effective public health responses. This research could pave the way for future studies on automated diagnostic systems, potentially influencing how other infectious diseases are diagnosed and managed. By addressing the limitations of current diagnostic methods, this work could lead to practical applications in clinical settings, improving healthcare delivery.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges include the scarcity of labeled training data, which is essential for training deep learning models effectively. Naive approaches may fail due to overfitting on small datasets or lack of generalizability to diverse patient populations. Additionally, the complexity of accurately identifying COVID-19 features in radiological images requires sophisticated models that can handle variations in imaging quality and patient demographics. Technical obstacles include the need for robust algorithms that can synthesize data and extract meaningful features without extensive labeled datasets.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often relied on large, annotated datasets, which are not always available, especially in the early stages of a pandemic. Many existing solutions do not adequately address the need for self-supervised learning techniques that can leverage unannotated data. This research proposes a novel approach that utilizes pseudo lesions for training, which has not been widely explored in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis. By focusing on self-supervised learning, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional methods that require extensive labeled data.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves a self-supervised learning framework that generates pseudo lesions to augment training data for COVID-19 diagnosis. This will utilize a conditional generative model to create synthetic images based on normal CT scans. The model will be trained on two public COVID-19 datasets, with performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n\u00a9 S. Hanneke, S. Moran & T.

Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1.

We investigate classical principles related to generalization within the context of list learning. Our primary goal is to determine whether classical principles in the PAC setting retain their applicability in the domain of list PAC learning. We focus on uniform convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam's Razor). In classical PAC learning, both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of `completeness': whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres to these principles. We ask whether the same completeness holds true in the list learning setting.   We show that uniform convergence remains equivalent to learnability in the list PAC learning setting. In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\\\\{0,1,2\\\\}$, then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986). We prove an even stronger impossibility result, showing that there are $2$-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed even when the reconstructed function can work with lists of arbitrarily large size. We prove a similar result for (1-list) PAC learnable classes when the label space is unbounded.

Of vast\nand steadily growing importance, the market for RDB management\nsystems alone is expected to exceed $133 billion USD by 2028 [ 56].\nEven so, while the machine learning community has devoted con-\nsiderable attention to predictive tasks involving single tables, or\nso-called tabular modeling tasks [ 21,49,58], thus far efforts to\nwiden the scope to handle multiple tables and RDBs still lags be-\nhind, despite the seemingly enormous potential of doing so. With\n\u2217Equal contribution. Corresponding authors: {minjiw,quagan}@amazon.com\n\u2020Work done during an internship in Amazon Web Services.respect to the latter, in many real-world scenarios critical features\nneeded for accurately modeling a given quantity of interest are not\nconstrained to a single table [ 9,14], nor can be easily flattened into\na single table via reliable/obvious feature engineering [15].\nThis disconnect between commercial opportunity and academic\nresearch focus can, at least in large part, be traced back to one trans-\nparent culprit: Unlike widely-studied computer vision [ 16], natural\nlanguage processing [ 67], tabular [ 28], and graph [ 35] domains,\nestablished benchmarks for evaluating predictive ML models of\nRDB data are much less prevalent. This reality is an unsurprising\nconsequence of privacy concerns and the typical storage of RDBs\non servers with heavily restrictive access and/or licensing protec-\ntions. With few exceptions (that will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\nspecifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\non the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to produce the provided graphs and features. As for the\nsecond branch, emphasis is placed on tabular model evaluations\nthat preserve the original format of single table data, possibly with\naugmentations collected from auxiliary tables.

Both the mixing coefficients and the community distribution are parameterized by the low-dimensional representations of the nodes and communities. We designed an effective variational inference algorithm which regularizes the community membership of neighboring nodes to be similar in the latent space.

Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the semantics of community structures for the community detection, and propose an effective framework of graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) for detecting communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation.

A successful approach could lead to more accurate predictive models that utilize the full complexity of relational data, thereby enhancing decision-making processes across various industries. Furthermore, establishing benchmarks and methodologies for RDBs could stimulate further research and innovation in this area, bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in addressing this problem stem from the complexity of relational data, which often involves multiple interrelated tables and intricate relationships that are difficult to capture using traditional single-table models. Naive approaches, such as flattening data into a single table, can lead to significant information loss and fail to exploit the relational structure. Additionally, the lack of established benchmarks for evaluating models on RDBs complicates the development and comparison of new methodologies, making it difficult to ascertain their effectiveness.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-table data or has used surrogate benchmarks that do not accurately reflect the complexities of RDBs. The absence of standardized evaluation metrics and datasets for RDBs has hindered progress in this area. Moreover, existing solutions often rely on manual feature engineering, which is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our approach aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a framework that directly incorporates the relational structure of data, thereby improving upon prior work that has not adequately addressed the unique challenges posed by RDBs.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel machine learning framework that treats relational databases as heterogeneous graphs, preserving the relational structure while enabling effective learning. We will utilize real-world datasets from RDBench, focusing on tasks such as entity attribute prediction and relationship modeling. The evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, and recall, allowing for comprehensive performance assessment.

Traditional security measures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber attacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network security, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses conventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. The integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection. However, the challenge with the state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches is that they prevent the generalization to unseen attacks embedded in the payloads, prohibiting them from accurately detecting new attacks and transferring knowledge learned from previous attacks to the new attacks with small labeled sample sizes. This paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning and few-shot learning. Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer to learn the embedding of the payloads from a vast amount of unlabeled datasets by masking portions of payloads, leading to a learnt representation that well generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from payloads, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the transformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of attacks using few-shot learning approaches.

Techniques such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) have been introduced to allow IDSs analyze the content of network packets, providing more context for identifying potential threats. IDSs traditionally rely on using anomaly-based and signature-based detection techniques to detect unrecognized and suspicious activity. Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in DPI for IDSs due to their efficiency in learning intricate patterns from the packet content being transmitted through the network. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary DPI algorithm based on transformers adapted for the purpose of detecting malicious traffic with a classifier head. Transformers learn the complex content of sequence data and generalize them well to similar scenarios thanks to their self-attention mechanism.

Traditional security defenses are becoming less effective against the advanced tactics of today's cyberattacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has emerged as a key technology in strengthening network security, offering detailed analysis of network traffic that goes beyond simple metadata analysis. DPI examines not only the packet headers but also the payload content within, offering a thorough insight into the data traversing the network. This study proposes a novel approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) and few-shot learning to accurately recognizes novel, unseen malware types with few labels samples. Our proposed approach uses a pretrained LLM on known malware types to extract the embeddings from packets. The embeddings are then used alongside few labeled samples of an unseen malware type. This technique is designed to acclimate the model to different malware representations, further enabling it to generate robust embeddings for each trained and unseen classes.

Recent studies have shown that DL-based malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversary can create carefully crafted adversarial examples to evade DL-based malware detectors. In this paper, we propose Mal2GCN, a robust malware detection model that uses Function Call Graph (FCG) representation of executable files combined with Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to detect Windows malware. Since FCG representation of executable files is more robust than raw byte sequence representation, numerous proposed adversarial example generating methods are ineffective in evading Mal2GCN. Moreover, we use the non-negative training method to transform Mal2GCN to a monotonically non-decreasing function; thereby, it becomes theoretically robust against appending attacks. We then present a black-box source code-based adversarial malware generation approach that can be used to evaluate the robustness of malware detection models against real-world adversaries. The proposed approach injects adversarial codes into the various locations of malware source codes to evade malware detection models. The experiments demonstrate that Mal2GCN with non-negative weights has high accuracy in detecting Windows malware, and it is also robust against adversarial attacks that add benign features to the Malware source code.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12473v2\", \"timestamp\": 1630093333, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent2", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"514ef028-6e9e-4cb3-a8d0-e25363115d3a\", \"authors\": [\"Hadjer Benkraouda\", \"Jingyu Qian\", \"Hung Quoc Tran\", \"Berkay Kaplan\"], \"title\": \"Attacks on Visualization-Based Malware Detection: Balancing Effectiveness and Executability\", \"abstract\": \"With the rapid development of machine learning for image classification, researchers have found new applications of visualization techniques in malware detection.

Improving malware detection systems can significantly enhance network security, leading to better protection against data breaches and cyberattacks. This research could pave the way for future studies on self-supervised and few-shot learning techniques in cybersecurity, potentially leading to practical applications in real-time threat detection and response.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to accurately identify and classify malware that has not been previously encountered, which requires the model to generalize well from limited labeled data. Traditional supervised learning methods often struggle with this due to their reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are not always available. Additionally, the dynamic nature of malware variants and the potential for adversarial attacks complicate the detection process, making it challenging to develop robust models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either signature-based or anomaly-based detection methods, which often fail to adapt to new malware types. The lack of sufficient labeled data for training models on unseen malware has been a significant barrier. Additionally, many existing approaches do not leverage the full potential of transformer architectures or self-supervised learning techniques, which could improve generalization and accuracy. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by integrating self-supervised learning with transformer models to enhance detection capabilities.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using transformer-based models trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets, specifically focusing on payload data from network packets. We will utilize the UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IoT23 datasets for evaluation, employing metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to assess performance.
