This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

This approach comes with a trade-off in terms of increased computational and memory demands. Relying on graph spectral theory, we make a fundamental observation: the regular and the Hadamard power of the Laplacian matrix behave similarly in the spectrum. This observation has significant implications for capturing higher-order information in GNNs for various tasks such as node classification and semi-supervised learning. Consequently, we propose a novel graph convolutional operator based on the sparse Sobolev norm of graph signals. Our approach, known as Sparse Sobolev GNN (S2-GNN), employs Hadamard products between matrices to maintain the sparsity level in graph representations. S2-GNN utilizes a cascade of filters with increasing Hadamard powers to generate a diverse set of functions. We theoretically analyze the stability of S2-GNN to show the robustness of the model against possible graph perturbations.

The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts.

Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents.

Moreover, even a few studies have checked and/or imposed regularity conditions, most of them equate curvature alone with regularity, thus ignoring or minimizing the importance of other regularities.

Nu-\nmerous studies elaborating the stability of materials and\nthe mobility of ions have been conducted using theoret-\nical calculations because these aspects are directly re-\nlated to device performance. To further advance our\nunderstanding of the operating mechanisms of such ion-\nconducting devices, atomic-scale analyses of ionic motion\nin device operating circumstances, that is, under electric\nfields, are crucial.\nAssuming a linear response, external forces arising\nfrom applied electric fields can be estimated simply by\nmultiplying the electric field vector by the valence states\nof the ions. In electronic state calculations, such as den-\nsity functional theory (DFT) calculations, the valence\nstates are often evaluated, for instance, using Mulliken\ncharges from the coefficients of atomic orbitals [4] or\nBader charges using charge density distributions [5]. By\ncontrast, the Born effective charges are defined from the\ninduced polarisation in a periodic system by their atomic\ndisplacements (see Fig. 1(a)), or are equivalently de-\nfined from the induced atomic forces with respect to the\napplied electric fields. As our current interest lies in\nanalysing ion motion under applied electric fields, and the\nlatter definition precisely corresponds to the target situ-\nation, Born effective charges, rather than static valence\n\u2217shimizu@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\u2020watanabe@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jpstates, are the suitable physical quantities to evaluate the\nexternal forces acting on the ions. In addition, the Born\neffective charges can be quantified as the number of each\natom without the arbitrariness of the decomposition of\nthe total charges. In most cases, these per-atom quanti-\nties are compatible with the computational processes of\ndynamic calculations using the methods include the high-dimensional neural network po-\ntential (NNP) [6], Gaussian approximation potential [7],\nmoment tensor potential [8], and spectral neighbour anal-\nysis potential [9]. Numerous studies have demonstrated\nthat ML potentials optimised using DFT calculation data\ncan predict various physical quantities comparable to\nthose of DFT calculations at low computational costs\n[10\u201313]. Notably, in their applications to solid electrolyte\nmaterials, the predicted ionic conductivities agree well\nwith both the DFT and experimental RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nFirst, we constructed the NNP using a network archi-\ntecture of 125 input nodes, two hidden layers with 15\nnodes, and one output node, [125-15-15-1], for each el-\nemental species.

Here, we explore the potential of recently developed machine-learning force fields for predicting different ion migration mechanisms in SSICs. Specifically, we systematically investigate three classes of SSICs that all exhibit complex ion dynamics including vibrational anharmonicities: AgI, a strongly disordered Ag$^+$ conductor; Na$_3$SbS$_4$, a Na$^+$ vacancy conductor; and Li$_{10}$GeP$_2$S$_{12}$, which features concerted Li$^+$ migration. Through systematic comparison with \\\\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics data, we demonstrate that machine-learning molecular dynamics provides very accurate predictions of the structural and vibrational properties including the complex anharmonic dynamics in these SSICs. The \\\\textit{ab initio} accuracy of machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at relatively low computational cost open a promising path toward the rapid design of novel SSICs.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11244v1\", \"timestamp\": 1705762617, \"domain\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"fcb26294-0416-4b3a-8c9c-011848827867\", \"authors\": [\"Ann Rutt\", \"Jimmy-Xuan Shen\", \"Matthew Horton\", \"Jiyoon Kim\", \"Jerry Lin\", \"Kristin A.

This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et\u00a0al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\u00a0al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that: For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should augment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions like those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry knowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07228v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350797, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"995a013f-389d-400c-8511-cecfaeda0f95\", \"authors\": [\"Marcel Gievers\", \"Richard Schmidt\", \"Jan von Delft\", \"Fabian B.

This setup is motivated by, and applied to, the reduced-order modeling of parametric dynamical systems. In such applications, parametric solutions are often reconstructed from space-time slices through sparse sampling over the parameter domain. To address this non-standard completion problem, we introduce a novel low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then incorporated into a Galerkin reduced order model (ROM), specifically an interpolatory tensor-based ROM. We demonstrate the performance of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731345902, \"domain\": \"math.NA\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"01b8f777-2fd3-40ec-8f96-13459745e85f\", \"authors\": [\"Emanuela Radici\", \"Federico Stra\"], \"title\": \"Deterministic particle method for nonlinear nonlocal scalar balance equations\", \"abstract\": \"We study a deterministic particle scheme to solve a scalar balance equation with nonlocal interaction and nonlinear mobility used to model congested dynamics.

Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure\u00a01 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo leads the LLM to perform the task.

To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements.

Although numerous adversarial attacks against centralized GNNs are proposed, their attack performance is challenged in the VFGL scenario.

A query-efficient hybrid adversarial attack framework is proposed to significantly improve the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, denoted as NA2, short for Neuron-based Adversarial Attack.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

In existing studies, Jacobi decoding, an iterative parallel decoding algorithm, has been used to accelerate the auto-regressive generation and can be executed without training. However, the Jacobi decoding relies on a deterministic criterion to determine the convergence of iterations. Thus, it works for greedy decoding but is incompatible with sampling-based decoding which is crucial for visual quality and diversity in the current auto-regressive text-to-image generation. In this paper, we propose a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm, Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD), to accelerate auto-regressive text-to-image generation. By introducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the inference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the randomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate diverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple tokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion, enabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional next-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization strategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve the acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our proposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models, showing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual quality.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01699v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727885127, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e65d7e6b-1e35-46cd-9af1-8daddf00d245\", \"authors\": [\"Zhuoyan Luo\", \"Fengyuan Shi\", \"Yixiao Ge\", \"Yujiu Yang\", \"Limin Wang\", \"Ying Shan\"], \"title\": \"Open-MAGVIT2: An Open-Source Project Toward Democratizing Auto-regressive Visual Generation\", \"abstract\": \"We present Open-MAGVIT2, a family of auto-regressive image generation models ranging from 300M to 1.5B.

In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novel auto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and view prediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a single image and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging the gap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovative camera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of 2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in an auto-regressive manner.

We study the processing of visual tokens in the language model component of LLaVA, a prominent VLM.

Through ablation studies, we demonstrated that object identification accuracy drops by over 70\\\\% when object-specific tokens are removed. We observed that visual token representations become increasingly interpretable in the vocabulary space across layers, suggesting an alignment with textual tokens corresponding to image content. Finally, we found that the model extracts object information from these refined representations at the last token position for prediction, mirroring the process in text-only language models for factual association tasks.

In our benchmark, which is curated to evaluate MLLMs visual semantic understanding and fine-grained perception capabilities, we discussed different visual tokenizers pre-trained with dominant methods (i.e., DeiT, CLIP, MAE, DINO), and observe that: i) Fully/weakly supervised models capture more semantics than self-supervised models, but the gap is narrowed by scaling up the pre-training dataset. ii) Self-supervised models are better at fine-grained perception, where patch-level supervision is particularly effective. iii) Tuning the visual tokenizer leads to the loss of semantics obtained from large-scale pretraining, which is unfavorable with relatively small-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Given the findings, we reviewed methods that attempted to unify semantics and fine-grained visual understanding, e.g., patch-level feature distillation with semantically-rich targets.

In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end framework named PerceptionGPT, which efficiently and effectively equips the VLLMs with visual perception abilities by leveraging the representation power of LLMs' token embedding. Our proposed method treats the token embedding of the LLM as the carrier of spatial information, then leverage lightweight visual task encoders and decoders to perform visual perception tasks (e.g., detection, segmentation). Our approach significantly alleviates the training difficulty suffered by previous approaches that formulate the visual outputs as discrete tokens, and enables achieving superior performance with fewer trainable parameters, less training data and shorted training time. Moreover, as only one token embedding is required to decode the visual outputs, the resulting sequence length during inference is significantly reduced. Consequently, our approach enables accurate and flexible representations, seamless integration of visual perception tasks, and efficient handling of a multiple of visual outputs. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach through extensive experiments.

Particularly, to obtain these concept tokens, we only use cross-attention to extract visual information from the image tokens layer by layer without self-attention between concept tokens, preventing information leakage across concept tokens. We further propose a Concept Disentangling Loss to facilitate that different concept tokens represent independent visual concepts. The cross-attention and disentangling loss play the role of induction and mutual exclusion for the concept tokens, respectively.

It can advance knowledge by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of feature transformation, leading to better outcomes in regression and classification tasks.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in developing a method that can effectively utilize historical information from the data, identify optimal substructures, and transform crucial nodes to generate high-quality features. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of feature transformation and the need to balance feature importance scores. Technical obstacles include ensuring stability, learning strategy from transformation steps, and achieving a balanced feature importance distribution.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on iterative approaches that lacked stability and could not learn strategy from transformation steps effectively. The limitations in existing solutions include stochasticity, lack of stability, and the inability to reuse high-value sub-transformations efficiently. Our approach differs by incorporating a graph-based model that reuses important intermediate nodes and transforms them to generate more significant features, addressing the gaps in previous research.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves leveraging a graph-based model to reuse high-value sub-transformations, exploring and transforming crucial nodes, and balancing feature importance scores.

However, the heterogeneity nature of tabular features makes such features relatively independent, and developing effective methods to promote tabular feature interaction still remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Estimator, which automatically estimates the relations among tabular features and builds graphs by assigning edges between related features. Such relation graphs organize independent tabular features into a kind of graph data such that interaction of nodes (tabular features) can be conducted in an orderly fashion. Based on our proposed Graph Estimator, we present a bespoke Transformer network tailored for tabular learning, called T2G-Former, which processes tabular data by performing tabular feature interaction guided by the relation graphs. A specific Cross-level Readout collects salient features predicted by the layers in T2G-Former across different levels, and attains global semantics for final prediction. Comprehensive experiments show that our T2G-Former achieves superior performance among DNNs and is competitive with non-deep Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16887v2\", \"timestamp\": 1669804764, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"315ed65c-5a5a-472e-b2e1-a5832c0be07c\", \"authors\": [\"Kushal Majmundar\", \"Sachin Goyal\", \"Praneeth Netrapalli\", \"Prateek Jain\"], \"title\": \"MET: Masked Encoding for Tabular Data\", \"abstract\": \"We consider the task of self-supervised representation learning (SSL) for tabular data: tabular-SSL. Typical contrastive learning based SSL methods require instance-wise data augmentations which are difficult to design for unstructured tabular data. Existing tabular-SSL methods design such augmentations in a relatively ad-hoc fashion and can fail to capture the underlying data manifold. Instead of augmentations based approaches for tabular-SSL, we propose a new reconstruction based method, called Masked Encoding for Tabular Data (MET), that does not require augmentations. MET is based on the popular MAE approach for vision-SSL [He et al., 2021] and uses two key ideas: (i) since each coordinate in a tabular dataset has a distinct meaning, we need to use separate representations for all coordinates, and (ii) using an adversarial reconstruction loss in addition to the standard one. Empirical results on five diverse tabular datasets show that MET achieves a new state of the art (SOTA) on all of these datasets and improves up to 9% over current SOTA methods. We shed more light on the working of MET via experiments on carefully designed simple datasets.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08564v1\", \"timestamp\": 1655445070, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"dfa9d79f-5ff4-4543-bff8-629f6c87e7fc\", \"authors\": [\"James Fiedler\"], \"title\": \"Simple Modifications to Improve Tabular Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"There is growing interest in neural network architectures for tabular data.

Accuracy aside, a major advantage of neural models is that they learn reusable features and are easily fine-tuned in new domains. This property is often exploited in computer vision and natural language applications, where transfer learning is indispensable when task-specific training data is scarce. In this work, we demonstrate that upstream data gives tabular neural networks a decisive advantage over widely used GBDT models. We propose a realistic medical diagnosis benchmark for tabular transfer learning, and we present a how-to guide for using upstream data to boost performance with a variety of tabular neural network architectures. Finally, we propose a pseudo-feature method for cases where the upstream and downstream feature sets differ, a tabular-specific problem widespread in real-world applications.

Despite the prevalence of tabular data in real-world applications, traditional deep learning methods often overlook the potentially valuable associations between data instances. Such associations can offer beneficial insights for classification tasks, as instances may exhibit similar patterns of correlations among features and target labels. This information can be exploited by graph neural networks, necessitating robust graph structures. However, existing studies primarily focus on improving graph structure from noisy data, largely neglecting the possibility of deriving graph structures from tabular data. We present a novel solution, Tabular Graph Structure Learning (TabGSL), to enhance tabular data prediction by simultaneously learning instance correlation and feature interaction within a unified framework. This is achieved through a proposed graph contrastive learning module, along with transformer-based feature extractor and graph neural network. Comprehensive experiments conducted on 30 benchmark tabular datasets demonstrate that TabGSL markedly outperforms both tree-based models and recent deep learning-based tabular models. Visualizations of the learned instance embeddings further substantiate the effectiveness of TabGSL.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15843v1\", \"timestamp\": 1685003628, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": []}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively promote tabular feature interaction in machine learning models?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem can lead to improved performance in machine learning tasks on tabular data, reducing the need for manual intervention and streamlining the data preparation phase. It can advance the field by enhancing the effectiveness of automated feature transformation methods.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe heterogeneity of tabular features makes them relatively independent, posing a challenge in promoting effective feature interaction. Designing methods to automatically estimate relations among features and build graphs for interaction is complex. Naive approaches may fail to capture the underlying data manifold and may lack stability in feature selection.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on traditional machine learning methods for tabular data, with limited exploration of effective feature interaction techniques. Existing approaches may be ad-hoc and fail to fully utilize the potential of tabular data. The complexity of tabular feature interaction and the need for automated methods have hindered previous solutions.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach involves developing a novel Graph Estimator to estimate relations among tabular features and build graphs for interaction. We will then implement a bespoke Transformer network tailored for tabular learning, called T2G-Former, to process data guided by the relation graphs.

In (a),\nthe sentence embeddings from different languages are\nclearly separated into two clusters. In (b), after English\nNLI training, the embedding space becomes indistin-\nguishable for different languages, and the parallel sen-\ntences are aligned to each other.\nsentence embeddings, previous work (Artetxe and\nSchwenk, 2019a; Chidambaram et al., 2019; Feng\net al., 2020) \ufb01netunes multilingual language mod-\nels with billions of parallel data. However, it is\nnon-trivial to obtain numerous parallel data for all\nlanguages. One potential direction to alleviate the\nneed for parallel data is to enhance cross-lingual\ntransfer of sentence embeddings.\nPre-trained multilingual language models (Pires\net al., 2019; Phang et al., 2020) have shown im-\npressive performance on cross-lingual zero-shot\ntransfer (Pires et al., 2019) that a model \ufb01netuned\non a source language can generalize to target lan-\nguages. This implies the representations \ufb01netuned\non downstream tasks are universal across various\nlanguages. In this work, we explore various cross-\nlingual transfer settings on sentence retrieval tasks,\nespecially in the setting of using English data only.\nWe propose multilingual-SimCSE (mSimCSE)\nwhich extends SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021), a fa-\nmous sentence embedding method on English, to\nmultilingual for cross-lingual transfer. SimCSE isarXiv:2211.06127v1  [cs.CL]  11 Nov 2022a contrastive learning (Chopra et al., 2005; Hadsell\net al., 2006; Chen et al., 2020a) method that pulls\ncloser semantically similar sentences (i.e. positive\nsentence pairs) in embeddings space. As done in\nSimCSE, we obtain positive training pairs by either\nnatural language inference (NLI) (Conneau et al.,\n2017; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) supervision or\nunsupervised data augmentation using dropout. We\nalso investigate model performance when a small\namount of parallel data or cross-lingual NLI data\nare available.\nIn our experiments.\nWe use our method to \ufb01netune XLM-Roberta-large\n(XLM-R) (Conneau et al., 2020).

Recent trends in learning both mono-lingual and multi-lingual sentence embeddings are mainly based on contrastive learning (CL) among an anchor, one positive, and multiple negative instances. In this work, we argue that leveraging multiple positives should be considered for multi-lingual sentence embeddings because (1) positives in a diverse set of languages can benefit cross-lingual learning, and (2) transitive similarity across multiple positives can provide reliable structural information for learning. In order to investigate the impact of multiple positives in CL, we propose a novel approach, named MPCL, to effectively utilize multiple positive instances to improve the learning of multi-lingual sentence embeddings. Experimental results on various backbone models and downstream tasks demonstrate that MPCL leads to better retrieval, semantic similarity, and classification performances compared to conventional CL.

Our method can be considered as contrastive learning with soft labels defined as the similarity between sentences. Our experimental results on five languages show that our contrastive loss with soft labels far outperforms conventional contrastive loss with hard labels in various benchmarks for bitext mining tasks and STS tasks.

As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of multilingual sentence encoders is the trade-off between monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Training for cross-lingual alignment of sentence embeddings distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks. In this work, we address both issues by modular training of sentence encoders, i.e., by separating monolingual specialization from cross-lingual alignment. We first efficiently train language-specific sentence encoders to avoid negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English monolingual encoders to the English encoder by training a cross-lingual alignment adapter on top of each, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. In both steps, we resort to contrastive learning on machine-translated paraphrase data. Monolingual and cross-lingual evaluations on semantic text similarity/relatedness and multiple-choice QA render our modular solution more effective than multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14878v1\", \"timestamp\": 1721483799, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"167794e9-d2cb-4c67-8c65-95a596213f36\", \"authors\": [\"Hanan Aldarmaki\", \"Mona Diab\"], \"title\": \"Context-Aware Cross-Lingual Mapping\", \"abstract\": \"Cross-lingual word vectors are typically obtained by fitting an orthogonal matrix that maps the entries of a bilingual dictionary from a source to a target vector space.

Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach.

DOI: 10.1145/3580305.3599843representation [ 15], and more recently helping in fine-tuning large\nlanguage models [ 73]. Their popularity has led to the development\nof various optimized frameworks and libraries [ 19,63,76] that\nenable the fast application of GNNs on new domains, making it\neasier for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of\nGNNs in their work.\nHowever, high-quality frameworks and libraries are necessary\nbut not sufficient for enabling fast research progress in GNN. One\nof the major challenges in GNN research is the lack of large-scale\ndatasets. This is because large graph datasets are typically propriety\nand most publicly available ones are rather small. The small size\nof these datasets makes it difficult to train GNNs that can handle\nlarge-graph structures and prevents the use of powerful pre-training\ntechniques [ 16,32,59,65]. These challenges make it difficult to fully\nleverage GNN potential and its applications.\nTo address these challenges, recent work such as OGBN and\nMAG [ 26,27] have proposed open large graph benchmark suites\nproviding up to 244 million nodes and 1.7 billion edge graphs. These\ndatasets contain a diverse set of graphs and have been widely used\nin the research community to benchmark GNNs\u2019 performance. How-\never, most existing datasets, including OGBN, provide very limited\nlabeled data. As GNN downstream tasks are often trained as super-\nvised learning tasks, having large labeled data matters, especially\nfor multi-label classification problems. However, both OGBN and\nMAG use Arxiv [ 26,27] class labels which provide 1.4 million la-\nbeled nodes, meaning only about 1% of the overall dataset is labeled!\nWith such small labeled data usage during training, it becomes chal-\nlenging to determine if the GNN model\u2019s low accuracy for unseen\ndata is inherently due to insufficient training data or if the model\nitself fails to generalize [28, 37, 45, 62, 78].\nFurthermore, the lack of flexible datasets hinders the researcher\u2019s\nability to scrutinize and systematically evaluate the scalability of\nthe GNN models, frameworks, and systems. Ideally, a dataset should\nprovide (a) capability to study the impact of embedding generation\ntechniques and their properties on the GNN model\u2019s accuracy, (b)\nprovide sub-datasets of varying graph sizes and embeddings main-\ntaining consistent homophily, and (c) provide a range of multi-class\nclassification tasks with varying degrees of complexity. Without\nsuch flexible datasets, it is difficult to train models on small graph\ndatasets and then evaluate their accuracy and execution efficiency\non larger data corpus, a common scenario in industrial settings.\nMoreover, the framework and system scalability problems encoun-\ntered with small datasets are different from those with large datasets,\nmaking it challenging to study the system requirements of GNNs.arXiv:2302.13522v2  [cs.LG]  21 Jun 2023Arpandeep Khatua, Vikram Sharma Mailthody, Bhagyashree Taleka, Tengfei Ma, Xiang Song, and Wen-mei Hwu\nTo this end, this work proposes Illinois Graph Benchmark\n(IGB) , a research dataset tool that the researchers can use to scruti-\nnize and systematically evaluate the GNN models and their execu-\ntion efficiency.

However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks.

However, their design often limits them to learning only higher-order feature interactions, leaving low-order feature interactions overlooked. To address this problem, we introduce a novel GNN method called explicit feature interaction-aware graph neural network (EFI-GNN). Unlike conventional GNNs, EFI-GNN is a multilayer linear network designed to model arbitrary-order feature interactions explicitly within graphs. To validate the efficacy of EFI-GNN, we conduct experiments using various datasets.

This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes.

To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements.

Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets (approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news articles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to evolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score exceeding 92\\\\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and lower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This study demonstrates the benefit of neurosymbolic methods in interpreting text in a dynamic environment for tasks such as health surveillance.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07163v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731346914, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent6": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"83e34973-2c1f-42a8-824b-42760655d95c\", \"authors\": [\"Jiaxuan You\", \"Jonathan Gomes-Selman\", \"Rex Ying\", \"Jure Leskovec\"], \"title\": \"Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful modeling framework for relational data.

This paper introduces the Edge Sensor Network for Predictive Maintenance (ESN-PdM), a hierarchical inference framework across edge devices, gateways, and cloud services for real-time condition monitoring. The system dynamically adjusts inference locations--on-device, on-gateway, or on-cloud--based on trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and battery life, leveraging Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques for model optimization on resource-constrained devices. Performance evaluations showed that on-sensor and on-gateway inference modes achieved over 90\\\\% classification accuracy, while cloud-based inference reached 99\\\\%. On-sensor inference reduced power consumption by approximately 44\\\\%, enabling up to 104 hours of operation. Latency was lowest for on-device inference (3.33 ms), increasing when offloading to the gateway (146.67 ms) or cloud (641.71 ms). The ESN-PdM framework provides a scalable, adaptive solution for reliable anomaly detection and PdM, crucial for maintaining machinery uptime in remote environments. By balancing accuracy, latency, and energy consumption, this approach advances PdM frameworks for industrial applications.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07168v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731347284, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"596de692-98ed-48e0-b3ba-e23d5bbb7527\", \"authors\": [\"Vedant Khandelwal\", \"Manas Gaur\", \"Ugur Kursuncu\", \"Valerie Shalin\", \"Amit Sheth\"], \"title\": \"A Domain-Agnostic Neurosymbolic Approach for Big Social Data Analysis: Evaluating Mental Health Sentiment on Social Media during COVID-19\", \"abstract\": \"Monitoring public sentiment via social media is potentially helpful during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, traditional frequency-based, data-driven neural network-based approaches can miss newly relevant content due to the evolving nature of language in a dynamically evolving environment. Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such as lexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate social media signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method that integrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing the detection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant to COVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets (approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news articles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to evolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score exceeding 92\\\\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and lower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This study demonstrates the benefit of neurosymbolic methods in interpreting text in a dynamic environment for tasks such as health surveillance.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07163v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731346914, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent6": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session 56d8767a-564b-453b-8e2f-db2985d782f7\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session 56d8767a-564b-453b-8e2f-db2985d782f7 \\nFrom agent6 to agent6: Hello, I have gathered some recent papers related to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that we can use as a foundation for brainstorming potential research ideas.

It can lead to improved accuracy and generalization of GNN models, enabling better performance in real-world applications. Addressing this challenge can also pave the way for more efficient utilization of GNNs in various domains, leading to practical applications in fraud detection, recommendation systems, molecular structure prediction, and more.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge of limited labeled data in training GNNs for multi-label classification tasks is difficult due to the inherent complexity of graph-structured data and the need for sufficient labeled data to train accurate models. Naive approaches may fail to generalize well or achieve high accuracy on unseen data, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to overcome the limitations of small labeled datasets. Technical obstacles include the lack of diverse and flexible datasets for training and evaluating GNN models, hindering the scalability and efficiency of these models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by the availability of large-scale labeled graph datasets, leading to challenges in training GNN models effectively for multi-label classification tasks. The existing datasets, such as OGBN and MAG, provide limited labeled data, making it challenging to determine if the model's low accuracy is due to insufficient training data or generalization issues. The lack of flexible datasets that allow for studying the impact of embedding generation techniques and varying graph sizes has also hindered progress in this area.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new dataset tool, Illinois Graph Benchmark (IGB), that provides access to large academic graph datasets for deep learning research. We plan to leverage this dataset tool to scrutinize and systematically evaluate GNN models and their execution efficiency, particularly focusing on addressing the challenges of limited labeled data in training GNNs for multi-label classification tasks.

Operator learning effectively approximates solution operators for PDEs and various PDE-related problems, yet it often struggles to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data.

For instance, a good response to a subjective query like \\\"What book should I read next?\\\" would depend on the user's preferences, and a good response to an open-ended query like \\\"How do antibiotics work against bacteria?\\\" would depend on the user's expertise. This makes evaluation of responses to such queries an ill-posed task, as evaluators may make arbitrary judgments about the response quality. To remedy this, we present contextualized evaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding an underspecified query and provides it during evaluation. We find that the presence of context can 1) alter conclusions drawn from evaluation, even flipping win rates between model pairs, 2) nudge evaluators to make fewer judgments based on surface-level criteria, like style, and 3) provide new insights about model behavior across diverse contexts.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length.

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories.

This however, comes along with a number of problems such as catastrophic forgetfulness, inefficient navigation behavior, and non-optimal synchronization between different entities of the navigation stack. In this paper, we propose a holistic Deep Reinforcement Learning training approach in which the training procedure is involving all entities of the navigation stack. This should enhance the synchronization between- and understanding of all entities of the navigation stack and as a result, improve navigational performance. We trained several agents with a number of different observation spaces to study the impact of different input on the navigation behavior of the agent.

The goal of this thesis is to make progress towards designing algorithms capable of `physical intelligence', i.e. building intelligent autonomous navigation agents capable of learning to perform complex navigation tasks in the physical world involving visual perception, natural language understanding, reasoning, planning, and sequential decision making. Despite several advances in classical navigation methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception, language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization, mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13415v1\", \"timestamp\": 1624594258, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"82dd8213-5b40-44de-9f95-42fe404d6363\", \"authors\": [\"L.

Nevertheless, the quantity \nof data remains decisive for the quality of a supervised classifier. Originating from the field of computer vision, many \ndifferent conclusion for this survey.  3 2 BACKGROUND: FOUNDATIONS, GOALS, AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA AUGMENTATION  \nIn many machine learning scenarios, not enough data is available to train a high -quality classifier. To a ddress this \nproblem, data augmentation can be used. It artificially enlarges the amount of available training data by means of \ntransformations [7]. In the well-known LeNet by LeCun et al. [8], early versions of data augmentation have already been \nobserved . The notion of data augmentation comprises various research in different sub -areas of machine learning. Many \nscientific works merely relate data augmentation to deep learning, yet it is frequently applied in the entire context of \nmachine learning. Therefore, this paper a dopts the notion of data augmentation as a broad concept, encompassing any \nmethod that enables the transformation of training data. However, following common understanding in research, semi -\nsupervised learning is not regarded as a form of data augmentation  and is only thematized if sensible in this survey.  \nAn important term relating to  data augmentation is label preservation, which describes transformations of training \ndata that preserve class information [9]. For exa mple, i n sentiment analysis, an entity replacement within a sentence is \noften sufficient for label preservation , but randomly adding  words may alter the sentiment (e.g., an additional \u201cnot\u201d \ncould invert the meaning of a sentence). In many research works, l abel preservation is adapted to also cover \ntransformations changing the class information , if the label is adjusted correctly. Additionally, many transformations do \nnot maintain the correct  class  in every case , but with a high probability. Shorten and Khoshgoftaar [5] define this \nprobability as the safety of a data augmentation method. When this uncertainty is known, it could be directly integrated \nin the label. Otherwise, conclusions. T he benchmark should not be too large, in order to ensure specific evaluations can \nstill be carried out . Researchers that try to develop such a benchmark, could also consider to specify how much data \naugmentation should be performed  and what models should be used.  When determining which model should be used , it \nmight be useful to create an updatable benchmark, as proposed by Gehrmann et al [157] , which can be modified \naccording to more recent state -of-the-art models.  \n4.4 Enhancing the Understanding  of Text  Data Augmentation   \nShorten and  Khoshgoftaar  [5] highlight that  while  for some image data augmentation techniques it is easy to understand \nhow they might improve the dataset and derived classifiers , however , for other techniques  this improvement has not \nbeen  explainable  yet. This also applies to the text regime, where for example, data augmentation results in a continuity \nproblem of learning, so that, e.g., the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"14d19f5b-0ce5-4665-9b2b-099a1964cc68\", \"authors\": [\"R.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

The main contribution of this paper is an approximate Bayesian framework for the calibration and uncertainty quantification of the force-field parameters, without assuming parameter uncertainty to be Gaussian. To this aim, since the likelihood function of the MD simulation models are intractable in absence of Gaussianity assumption, we use a likelihood-free inference scheme known as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and propose an adaptive population Monte Carlo ABC algorithm, which is illustrated to converge faster and scales better than previously used ABCsubsim algorithm for calibration of force-field of a helium system. The second contribution is the adaptation of ABC algorithms for High Performance Computing to MD simulation within the Python ecosystem ABCpy. We illustrate the performance of the developed methodology to learn posterior distribution and Bayesian estimates of Lennard-Jones force-field parameters of helium and TIP4P system of water implemented both for simulated and experimental datasets collected using Neutron and X-ray diffraction. For simulated data, the Bayesian estimate is in close agreement with the true parameter value used to generate the dataset. For experimental as well as for simulated data, the Bayesian posterior distribution shows a strong correlation pattern between the force-field parameters. Providing an estimate of the entire posterior distribution, our methodology also allows us to perform uncertainty quantification of model prediction.

By improving uncertainty estimation, researchers can enhance the reliability of predictions, leading to more accurate simulations and better understanding of molecular behavior. This research can significantly impact future studies by providing a more robust framework for molecular force field predictions, ultimately advancing knowledge in the field of molecular dynamics.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in developing a method that can accurately estimate uncertainty in molecular force fields, especially when dealing with out-of-distribution data. Existing approaches have shown limitations in capturing diverse databases and providing reliable predictions for unforeseen events. The complexity of molecular interactions and the need for precise uncertainty quantification make this problem difficult to solve. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate nature of molecular dynamics and the unique requirements of uncertainty estimation in this context.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has not fully addressed the challenges of uncertainty estimation in molecular force fields, leading to gaps in existing solutions. The limitations of current methods, such as database-dependent metrics and poor performance on out-of-distribution data, have hindered the development of a comprehensive solution. By introducing a novel approach like the Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), which combines Gaussian Process-based extension with GNN-based force fields, researchers can overcome these limitations and provide a more reliable uncertainty estimation framework.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves deriving physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields, surveying previous UE methods, and introducing LNK as a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields. The expected outcomes include improved uncertainty estimation, reliable predictions for out-of-equilibrium detection, and up to 2.5 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score compared to existing UE methods.

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that $M_\\\\bullet \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a population of under-massive black holes ($M_\\\\bullet=10-10^5 M_\\\\odot$) in galaxies with $\\\\sigma \\\\lesssim 127$ km/s and over-massive black holes ($M_\\\\bullet \\\\geq 1.8 \\\\times 10^7$) above this threshold.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nAnomalous sound detection (ASD) aims to detect anomalies from acoustic signals. Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28].

To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nAutomatic speaker verification (ASV) systems have become in-\ncreasingly important in the field of voice recognition technol-\nogy including their applications in security systems, banking,\ncall centers, law enforcement, fraud prevention, criminal inves-\ntigations, and healthcare. Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\nto analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n\u2022 Unlike most prior studies that have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n\u2022 Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand the impact of ageing across the gender.\n\u2022 As opposed to the previous studies that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\nThe ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4. Methodology\nWe use the linear mixed effect (LME) [24] models to analyze\nthe variation in the ASV score with respect to the age differ-\nence under different gender, language, and session conditions.\nWe fit the following model to ASV score data under different\nconditions:\nSi=\u00b5+\u03b2\u2217\u03b4i+\u03b3 (1)\nwhere Siis ASV score of i-th trial, \u00b5is intercept or mean of the\nASV scores in a particular condition, \u03b4iis the age difference\nbetween enrollment and verification audio, \u03b2is fixed effect co-\nefficient that establishes a linear relationship between age dif-\nference ( \u03b4i) and ASV score Si, and\u03b3is a random effect which is\ninduced by other variabilities such as Results and Discussions\n5.1.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\nto analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n\u2022 Unlike most prior studies that have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n\u2022 Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand the impact of ageing across the gender.\n\u2022 As opposed to the previous studies that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\nThe ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4. Methodology\nWe use the linear mixed effect (LME) [24] models to analyze\nthe variation in the ASV score with respect to the age differ-\nence under different gender, language, and session conditions.\nWe fit the following model to ASV score data under different\nconditions:\nSi=\u00b5+\u03b2\u2217\u03b4i+\u03b3 (1)\nwhere Siis ASV score of i-th trial, \u00b5is intercept or mean of the\nASV scores in a particular condition, \u03b4iis the age difference\nbetween enrollment and verification audio, \u03b2is fixed effect co-\nefficient that establishes a linear relationship between age dif-\nference ( \u03b4i) and ASV score Si, and\u03b3is a random effect which is\ninduced by other variabilities such as Results and Discussions\n5.1.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\nto analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n\u2022 Unlike most prior studies that have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n\u2022 Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand the impact of ageing across the gender.\n\u2022 As opposed to the previous studies that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\nThe ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4. Methodology\nWe use the linear mixed effect (LME) [24] models to analyze\nthe variation in the ASV score with respect to the age differ-\nence under different gender, language, and session conditions.\nWe fit the following model to ASV score data under different\nconditions:\nSi=\u00b5+\u03b2\u2217\u03b4i+\u03b3 (1)\nwhere Siis ASV score of i-th trial, \u00b5is intercept or mean of the\nASV scores in a particular condition, \u03b4iis the age difference\nbetween enrollment and verification audio, \u03b2is fixed effect co-\nefficient that establishes a linear relationship between age dif-\nference ( \u03b4i) and ASV score Si, and\u03b3is a random effect which is\ninduced by other variabilities such as Results and Discussions\n5.1.

Speaker verification is done by the use of some parameters (features) from the speakers voice which can be used to differentiate among many speakers. The efficiency of speaker verification system mainly depends on the feature set providing high inter-speaker variability and low intra-speaker variability. There are many methods used for speaker verification. Some systems use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features (MFCCs), while others use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based speaker recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM), GMMs . In this paper simple intra-pitch temporal information in conjunction with pitch synchronous cepstral coefficients forms the feature set. The distinct feature of a speaker is determined from the steady state part of five cardinal spoken English vowels. The performance was found to be average when these features were used independently. But very encouraging results were observed when both features were combined to form a decision for speaker verification.

While most studies have focused on training schemes or system architectures for each specific task, the auxiliary network for embedding target-speaker cues has not been investigated comprehensively in a unified cross-task evaluation. Therefore, this paper aims to address a fundamental question: what is the preferred speaker embedding for TS tasks? To this end, for the TS-ASR, TSE, and p-VAD tasks, we compare pre-trained speaker encoders (i.e., self-supervised or speaker recognition models) that compute speaker embeddings from pre-recorded enrollment speech of the target speaker with ideal speaker embeddings derived directly from the target speaker's identity in the form of a one-hot vector. To further understand the properties of ideal speaker embedding, we optimize it using a gradient-based approach to improve performance on the TS task. Our analysis reveals that speaker verification performance is somewhat unrelated to TS task performances, the one-hot vector outperforms enrollment-based ones, and the optimal embedding depends on the input mixture.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11243v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728964693, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"82967322-6bc3-4671-a6da-55bf2f12020d\", \"authors\": [\"Zhenhao Ge\", \"Ananth N.

Features with stricter Voice Active Detection (VAD) than the regular one for speech recognition ensure extracting stronger voiced portion for speaker recognition, speaker-level mean and variance normalization helps to eliminate the discrepancy between samples from the same speaker. Both are proven to improve the system performance. In building the neural network speaker classifier, the network structure parameters are optimized with grid search and dynamically reduced regularization parameters are used to avoid training terminated in local minimum. It enables the training goes further with lower cost. In speaker verification, performance is improved with prediction score normalization, which rewards the speaker identity indices with distinct peaks and penalizes the weak ones with high scores but more competitors, and speaker-specific thresholding, which significantly reduces ERR in the ROC curve.

We define the task, which only detects the speech from the target speaker, as speaker-dependent voice activity detection (SDVAD). This task is quite common in real applications and usually implemented by performing speaker verification (SV) on audio segments extracted from VAD. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network based approach to address this problem, which explicitly takes the speaker identity into the modeling process. Moreover, inference can be performed in an online fashion, which leads to low system latency. Experiments are carried out on a conversational telephone dataset generated from the Switchboard corpus.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nGraph Structure Learning (GSL) is a burgeoning field of research that strives to unveil the underlying patterns and relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Jin et\u00a0al. (2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images.

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Aurora is a 1.3 billion parameter foundation model for high-resolution forecasting of weather and atmospheric processes. Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\u00a0al., 2023, Bi et\u00a0al., 2023, Chen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b, Han et\u00a0al., 2024, Kochkov et\u00a0al., 2024, Lessig et\u00a0al., 2023, Pathak et\u00a0al., 2022, Bonev et\u00a0al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\u00a0al., 2023, Ham et\u00a0al., 2019, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\u00a0al., 2021] or heterogeneous [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes [Charlton-Perez et\u00a0al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\u00a0al., 2022, Radford et\u00a0al., 2021, Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation model of the atmosphere. Aurora can produce forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric forecasting problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events. We demonstrate this ability by producing operational forecasts for global air pollution and global high-resolution medium-term weather patterns that match or outperform state-of-the-art classical simulation tools, at orders of magnitude smaller computational cost.\nSpecifically, in under a minute, Aurora generates 5-day air pollution forecasts at 0.4\u2218superscript0.40.4^{\\circ}0.4 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT spatial resolution surpassing state-of-the-art resource-intensive atmospheric chemistry simulations on 74%percent7474\\%74 % of all targets; 10-day global weather forecasts at 0.1\u2218superscript0.10.1^{\\circ}0.1 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT resolution surpassing the state-of-the-art\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015].

We demonstrate this ability by producing operational forecasts for global air pollution and global high-resolution medium-term weather patterns that match or outperform state-of-the-art classical simulation tools, at orders of magnitude smaller computational cost.\nSpecifically, in under a minute, Aurora generates 5-day air pollution forecasts at 0.4\u2218superscript0.40.4^{\\circ}0.4 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT spatial resolution surpassing state-of-the-art resource-intensive atmospheric chemistry simulations on 74%percent7474\\%74 % of all targets; 10-day global weather forecasts at 0.1\u2218superscript0.10.1^{\\circ}0.1 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT resolution surpassing the state-of-the-art\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The major success of GPT-type of language models is particularly exciting and raises expectations on the potential of foundation models in other domains including satellite remote sensing. In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation models to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include Prithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an important question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for different remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance the understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for pixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution, through comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size deep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios traditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to foundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for classification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising results for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar), while the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning models is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability of foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised learning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked autoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing problems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11797v1\", \"timestamp\": 1713396648, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d168a905-2773-454b-bade-896ea4ef0fff\", \"authors\": [\"Kaiyu Li\", \"Xiangyong Cao\", \"Deyu Meng\"], \"title\": \"A New Learning Paradigm for Foundation Model-based Remote Sensing Change Detection\", \"abstract\": \"Change detection (CD) is a critical task to observe and analyze dynamic processes of land cover. Although numerous deep learning-based CD models have performed excellently, their further performance improvements are constrained by the limited knowledge extracted from the given labelled data. On the other hand, the foundation models that emerged recently contain a huge amount of knowledge by scaling up across data modalities and proxy tasks. In this paper, we propose a Bi-Temporal Adapter Network (BAN), which is a universal foundation model-based CD adaptation framework aiming to extract the knowledge of foundation models for CD. The proposed BAN contains three parts, i.e. frozen foundation model (e.g., CLIP), bi-temporal adapter branch (Bi-TAB), and bridging modules between them. Specifically, BAN extracts general features through a frozen foundation model, which are then selected, aligned, and injected into Bi-TAB via the bridging modules. Bi-TAB is designed as a model-agnostic concept to extract task/domain-specific features, which can be either an existing arbitrary CD model or some hand-crafted stacked blocks. Beyond current customized models, BAN is the first extensive attempt to adapt the foundation model to the CD task.

In this study, we present a groundbreaking paradigm integrating Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) with foundation models, specifically designed to enhance local task performance on user equipment (UE). Central to our approach is the innovative Emulator-Adapter architecture, segmenting the foundation model into two cohesive modules. This design not only conserves computational resources but also ensures adaptability and fine-tuning efficiency for downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce an advanced resource allocation mechanism that is fine-tuned to the needs of the Emulator-Adapter structure in decentralized settings. To address the challenges presented by this system, we employ a hybrid multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategy, adept at handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces, ensuring dynamic and optimal resource allocations. Our comprehensive simulations and validations underscore the practical viability of our approach, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and scalability.

To support the application of machine\nlearning algorithms to solve this problem, and to\nencourage researchers in this \ufb01eld to attend to prob-\nlems in the ACO setting, we introduce CybORG, a\nwork-in-progress gym for ACO research. CybORG\nfeatures a simulation and emulation environment\nwith a common interface to facilitate the rapid\ntraining of autonomous agents that can then be\ntested on real-world systems. Initial testing demon-\nstrates the feasibility of this approach.\n1Background\nAutonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) is concerned with\nthe defence of computer systems and networks through au-\ntonomous decision-making and action. It is particularly\nneeded where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\nversary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop arti\ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\nrobotics, ACO is affected by the \u2018reality gap\u2019 [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021 ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could be critical to an agent\u2019s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\nwhich is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment, precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the \u2018reality gap\u2019, used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\nin a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated systems. Successful agents are trans-\nferred to the real system to \ufb01rstly validate their effectiveness,\nand secondly to re\ufb01ne the simulation.\nWe believe that AI Gyms, that can be validated and re-\n\ufb01ned throughexperiments, the requirements of ACO motivate an in-\ntegrated design comprising emulation and simulation modes\nto support large scale RL across diverse scenarios.\nWe have made progress towards implementing this design,\nwith the ability to spawn and play games either in simula-\ntion mode or emulation mode with cloud infrastructure.

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning, applying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult to learn only using random initialization.

The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\\\\times 256$ images.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350998, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d70a80a3-a160-4303-ad07-ed165dc3816d\", \"authors\": [\"Harsh Rangwani\"], \"title\": \"Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data\", \"abstract\": \"The datasets used for Deep Neural Network training (e.g., ImageNet, MSCOCO, etc.) are often manually balanced across categories (classes) to facilitate learning of all the categories. This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"28ead3f1-1132-4afb-8c49-49c29042163b\", \"authors\": [\"Matheus Sim\\u00e3o\", \"Fabiano Prado\", \"Omar Abdul Wahab\", \"Anderson Avila\"], \"title\": \"TempCharBERT: Keystroke Dynamics for Continuous Access Control Based on Pre-trained Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"With the widespread of digital environments, reliable authentication and continuous access control has become crucial. It can minimize cyber attacks and prevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular interest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of recognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this work, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize such patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP benchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization. BERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot be directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to recognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords and character-level information and can be an alternative solution. Notwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD as they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information (e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose TempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information in the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for the purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a significant improvement with this customization. We also showed the feasibility of training TempCharBERT on a federated learning settings in order to foster data privacy.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07224v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350657, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent4", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session ff7104f3-d094-4709-9f5f-1ca20f7e347d\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session ff7104f3-d094-4709-9f5f-1ca20f7e347d \\nFrom agent4 to agent1: I am working on a research task related to Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) and machine learning.

Autonomous cyber defenses therefore become essential to mitigate the risk of successful attacks and their damage, especially when the response time, effort and accuracy required in those defenses is impractical or impossible through defenses operated exclusively by humans. Autonomous agents have the potential to use ML with large amounts of data about known cyberattacks as input, in order to learn patterns and predict characteristics of future attacks. Moreover, learning from past and present attacks enable defenses to adapt to new threats that share characteristics with previous attacks. On the other hand, autonomous cyber defenses introduce risks of unintended harm. Actions arising from autonomous defense agents may have harmful consequences of functional, safety, security, ethical, or moral nature.

These agents, operating on critical network infrastructure, need to be robust and trustworthy to ensure defense against adaptive cyber-attackers and, simultaneously, provide explanations for their actions and network activity. However, learning-enabled components typically use models, such as deep neural networks, that are not transparent in their high-level decision-making leading to assurance challenges. Additionally, cyber-defense agents must execute complex long-term defense tasks in a reactive manner that involve coordination of multiple interdependent subtasks. Behavior trees are known to be successful in modelling interpretable, reactive, and modular agent policies with learning-enabled components. In this paper, we develop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior trees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber environment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The learning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks and deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a simulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and enhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture for evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios.

We devise a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based attack strategy and an RL-assisted Evolutionary Diversity Optimization-based defense strategy, where the attacker and defender improve each other strategy via parallel gameplay. To address the computational challenges of training attacker-defender strategies on numerous dynamic AD graphs, we propose an RL Training Facilitator that prunes environments and neural networks to eliminate irrelevant elements, enabling efficient and scalable training for large graphs.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5].

To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose three novel deep multilevel multimodal fusion frameworks to capitalize on different fusion strategies at various stages and to leverage the superiority of multilevel fusion. At input, we transform the depth data into depth images called sequential front view images (SFIs) and inertial sensor data into signal images.

These highly informative features are served as input to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive measurement of the adversarial robustness of multimodal learning by focusing on the fusion of input modalities in multimodal models, via a framework called MUROAN (MUltimodal RObustness ANalyzer). We first present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the fusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability. We then introduce a new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN that aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities. We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in the worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate of 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space. Finally, we show that traditional adversarial training is insufficient to improve the robustness of multimodal models with respect to decoupling attacks. We hope our findings encourage researchers to pursue improving the robustness of multimodal learning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12792v2\", \"timestamp\": 1640207402, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent8", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"paper_abstracts\": null, \"paper_titles\": null, \"co_authors\": null}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we design a provably robust multimodal fusion method to mitigate the influence of low-quality multimodal data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem can improve classification accuracy and model robustness, leading to advancements in multimodal research.

\n\n1 Introduction\n\nDeep probabilistic State Space Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe

Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\u00a0[22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\u00a0[16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\u00a0[28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba\u00a0[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure\u00a01 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\u00a0[44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\u00a0[42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\u00a0[39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\u00a0achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\u00a0[41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\u00a0KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound\u00a0[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe evaluate\u00a0KalMamba\u00a0on several tasks from the DeepMind Control (DMC) Suite\u00a0[50], training an off-the-shelf Soft Actor-Critic\u00a0[21] on beliefs inferred from both images\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world.

In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc can be obtained. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M0 and the initial accretion timescale tacc,0, the slope of the Md-Macc correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of log(Md/Macc) valid when the spread of tacc is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M0 and tacc,0, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the Md-Macc correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the Md-Macc correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07227v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350793, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3b0cd07f-517d-43df-bcdb-89b3be946121\", \"authors\": [\"Matheus Sim\\u00e3o\", \"Fabiano Prado\", \"Omar Abdul Wahab\", \"Anderson Avila\"], \"title\": \"TempCharBERT: Keystroke Dynamics for Continuous Access Control Based on Pre-trained Language Models\", \"abstract\": \"With the widespread of digital environments, reliable authentication and continuous access control has become crucial. It can minimize cyber attacks and prevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular interest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of recognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this work, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize such patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP benchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization. BERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot be directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to recognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords and character-level information and can be an alternative solution. Notwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD as they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information (e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose TempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information in the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for the purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a significant improvement with this customization. We also showed the feasibility of training TempCharBERT on a federated learning settings in order to foster data privacy.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07224v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350657, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b509812d-5008-4dcc-8e92-d5c6afcc9849\", \"authors\": [\"Yunhao Luo\", \"Yilun Du\"], \"title\": \"Grounding Video Models to Actions through Goal Conditioned Exploration\", \"abstract\": \"Large video models, pretrained on massive amounts of Internet video, provide a rich source of physical knowledge about the dynamics and motions of objects and tasks. However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks.

The second class turns out to include substantial variation in the position of the shadow variable in the causal structure (vis-a-vis the mediator and outcome) and the corresponding implications for the model. In constructing the models, to improve plausibility, we pay close attention to allowing, where possible, dependencies due to unobserved causes of the missingness.

For ex-\nample, in medical imaging, models trained on the data from one institution may\nnot generalize well to another institution with different imaging hardware. Sim-\nilarly, in battery capacity monitoring, models trained on lab-collected data may\nperform poorly under diverse operation environments. Obtaining the annotation\nfor the new domains, however, is often very costly or infeasible. To address this\n\u22c6Hanbing Liu, Jingge Wang, Xuan Zhang, and Yang Li are from the Shenzhen Key\nLaboratory of Ubiquitous Data Enabling, SIGS, Tsinghua University.arXiv:2402.16681v2  [cs.LG]  18 Mar 20242 Hanbing Liu et al.\nchallenge, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been proposed, lever-\naging the labeled data from the source domain to improve the performance of\nlearning models on the unlabeled target domain [5]. In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process.

Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA.

In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively.

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation. We show how our approach is on par with or even surpasses multiple behavior cloning baselines trained on expert demonstrations while without requiring any action annotations.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07223v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350624, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e209e64c-6cc6-42b7-a32b-ff811aa56f92\", \"authors\": [\"Trang Quynh Nguyen\", \"Razieh Nabi\", \"Fan Yang\", \"Elizabeth A.

In the context of mediation analysis, this paper addresses missingness in the two key variables, mediator and outcome, focusing on identification. We consider self-separated missingness models where identification is achieved by conditional independence assumptions only and self-connected missingness models where identification relies on so-called shadow variables. The first class is somewhat limited as it is constrained by the need to remove a certain number of connections from the model. The second class turns out to include substantial variation in the position of the shadow variable in the causal structure (vis-a-vis the mediator and outcome) and the corresponding implications for the model. In constructing the models, to improve plausibility, we pay close attention to allowing, where possible, dependencies due to unobserved causes of the missingness. In this exploration, we develop theory where needed. This results in templates for identification in this mediation setting, generally useful identification techniques, and perhaps most significantly, synthesis and substantial expansion of shadow variable theory.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07221v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350589, \"domain\": \"stat.ME\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"1e606559-f6df-4d9a-a424-bef34173a4fb\", \"authors\": [\"Camille Labourie\", \"Yana Teplitskaya\"], \"title\": \"Optimal regularity for quasiminimal sets of codimension one in $\\\\R^2$ and $\\\\R^3$\", \"abstract\": \"Quasiminimal sets are sets for which a pertubation can decrease the area but only in a controlled manner.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length. The aim of this paper is to mathematically prove this property and present a case study application in an electric machine.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07235v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731351270, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a696caab-ca25-4f3b-84f6-5f120a53d55f\", \"authors\": [\"Alexandra Lamtyugina\", \"Agnish Kumar Behera\", \"Aditya Nandy\", \"Carlos Floyd\", \"Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan\"], \"title\": \"Score-based generative diffusion with \\\"active\\\" correlated noise sources\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the underlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the approximated distribution.

Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\\\\times 256$ images.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350998, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent8": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"ab20cc3d-1467-475e-a274-82b05ea16065\", \"authors\": [\"Bo Yang\", \"Qingping Yang\", \"Runtao Liu\"], \"title\": \"UTMath: Math Evaluation with Unit Test via Reasoning-to-Coding Thoughts\", \"abstract\": \"The evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities is essential for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

This paper introduces the UTMath Benchmark, which robustly evaluates the models through extensive unit tests. It consists of 1,053 problems across 9 mathematical domains, with over 68 test cases per problem.We propose an innovative evaluation framework inspired by unit testing in software development, focusing on both accuracy and reliability of results.

To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model, while carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to integrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed methods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream data. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning, applying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult to learn only using random initialization.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images.

We claim that USLs should, instead, be designed to grow. We present Exo 2, a scheduling language that enables users to define new scheduling operations externally to the compiler. By composing a set of trusted, fine-grained primitives, users can safely write their own scheduling library to build up desired automation. We identify actions (ways of modifying code), inspection (ways of interrogating code), and references (ways of pointing to code) as essential for any user-extensible USL.   We fuse these ideas into a new mechanism called Cursors that enables the creation of scheduling libraries in user code.

However, these models struggle to generalize as they typically learn superficial mapping from source code to labels instead of understanding the root causes of code vulnerabilities, resulting in poor performance in real-world scenarios beyond the training instances. To tackle this challenge, we introduce VulLLM, a novel framework that integrates multi-task learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively mine deep-seated vulnerability features. Specifically, we construct two auxiliary tasks beyond the vulnerability detection task. First, we utilize the vulnerability patches to construct a vulnerability localization task. Second, based on the vulnerability features extracted from patches, we leverage GPT-4 to construct a vulnerability interpretation task. VulLLM innovatively augments vulnerability classification by leveraging generative LLMs to understand complex vulnerability patterns, thus compelling the model to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities rather than overfitting to spurious features of a single task.

In this paper, we present RealVul, the first LLM-based framework designed for PHP vulnerability detection, addressing these issues. By vulnerability candidate detection methods and employing techniques such as normalization, we can isolate potential vulnerability triggers while streamlining the code and eliminating unnecessary semantic information, enabling the model to better understand and learn from the generated vulnerability samples. We also address the issue of insufficient PHP vulnerability samples by improving data synthesis methods. To evaluate RealVul's performance, we conduct an extensive analysis using five distinct code LLMs on vulnerability data from 180 PHP projects.

We compare ChatGPT with state-of-the-art language models designed for software vulnerability purposes.

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that $M_\\\\bullet \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies.

This makes evaluation of responses to such queries an ill-posed task, as evaluators may make arbitrary judgments about the response quality. To remedy this, we present contextualized evaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding an underspecified query and provides it during evaluation. We find that the presence of context can 1) alter conclusions drawn from evaluation, even flipping win rates between model pairs, 2) nudge evaluators to make fewer judgments based on surface-level criteria, like style, and 3) provide new insights about model behavior across diverse contexts.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nText-to-image generative models have witnessed significant advancements in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17].

Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11].

And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\\\\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generation.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06998v2\", \"timestamp\": 1665666534, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"3bed4400-1d79-45e8-8af1-a73030249c18\", \"authors\": [\"Han Zhang\", \"Weichong Yin\", \"Yewei Fang\", \"Lanxin Li\", \"Boqiang Duan\", \"Zhihua Wu\", \"Yu Sun\", \"Hao Tian\", \"Hua Wu\", \"Haifeng Wang\"], \"title\": \"ERNIE-ViLG: Unified Generative Pre-training for Bidirectional Vision-Language Generation\", \"abstract\": \"Conventional methods for the image-text generation tasks mainly tackle the naturally bidirectional generation tasks separately, focusing on designing task-specific frameworks to improve the quality and fidelity of the generated samples. Recently, Vision-Language Pre-training models have greatly improved the performance of the image-to-text generation tasks, but large-scale pre-training models for text-to-image synthesis task are still under-developed. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG, a unified generative pre-training framework for bidirectional image-text generation with transformer model. Based on the image quantization models, we formulate both image generation and text generation as autoregressive generative tasks conditioned on the text/image input. The bidirectional image-text generative modeling eases the semantic alignments across vision and language. For the text-to-image generation process, we further propose an end-to-end training method to jointly learn the visual sequence generator and the image reconstructor. To explore the landscape of large-scale pre-training for bidirectional text-image generation, we train a 10-billion parameter ERNIE-ViLG model on a large-scale dataset of 145 million (Chinese) image-text pairs which achieves state-of-the-art performance for both text-to-image and image-to-text tasks, obtaining an FID of 7.9 on MS-COCO for text-to-image synthesis and best results on COCO-CN and AIC-ICC for image captioning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15283v1\", \"timestamp\": 1640922813, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7a303260-c020-4e51-9c98-71f248721d04\", \"authors\": [\"Zihao Wang\", \"Wei Liu\", \"Qian He\", \"Xinglong Wu\", \"Zili Yi\"], \"title\": \"CLIP-GEN: Language-Free Training of a Text-to-Image Generator with CLIP\", \"abstract\": \"Training a text-to-image generator in the general domain (e.g., Dall.e, CogView) requires huge amounts of paired text-image data, which is too expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named as CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator. Specifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the image encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the unlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision representation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image tokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon an input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general text-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly outperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality while not compromising the text-image matching.

We first demonstrate that a diffusion model trained to reconstruct an input image from frozen embeddings, can reconstruct the image with minor variations. Second, inspired by how text-to-image models learn from web-scale text-image pairs, we explore a new pretraining strategy to generate image variations using a large collection of image pairs. Our diffusion model \\\\textit{Semantica} receives a random (encoded) image from a webpage as conditional input and denoises another noisy random image from the same webpage.

Addressing this question could advance knowledge in the field of generative models and lead to practical applications in various domains such as art, design, and content creation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in defining an objective that authentically captures human preferences, incorporating diverse divergence constraints to enhance output diversity, and overcoming the limitations of existing fine-tuning techniques that may lead to reduced diversity in generated outputs.

Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\\\\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generation.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06998v2\", \"timestamp\": 1665666534, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d255cba2-f8c5-4cd2-a2e9-27054114d2e7\", \"authors\": [\"Han Zhang\", \"Weichong Yin\", \"Yewei Fang\", \"Lanxin Li\", \"Boqiang Duan\", \"Zhihua Wu\", \"Yu Sun\", \"Hao Tian\", \"Hua Wu\", \"Haifeng Wang\"], \"title\": \"ERNIE-ViLG: Unified Generative Pre-training for Bidirectional Vision-Language Generation\", \"abstract\": \"Conventional methods for the image-text generation tasks mainly tackle the naturally bidirectional generation tasks separately, focusing on designing task-specific frameworks to improve the quality and fidelity of the generated samples. Recently, Vision-Language Pre-training models have greatly improved the performance of the image-to-text generation tasks, but large-scale pre-training models for text-to-image synthesis task are still under-developed. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG, a unified generative pre-training framework for bidirectional image-text generation with transformer model. Based on the image quantization models, we formulate both image generation and text generation as autoregressive generative tasks conditioned on the text/image input. The bidirectional image-text generative modeling eases the semantic alignments across vision and language. For the text-to-image generation process, we further propose an end-to-end training method to jointly learn the visual sequence generator and the image reconstructor. To explore the landscape of large-scale pre-training for bidirectional text-image generation, we train a 10-billion parameter ERNIE-ViLG model on a large-scale dataset of 145 million (Chinese) image-text pairs which achieves state-of-the-art performance for both text-to-image and image-to-text tasks, obtaining an FID of 7.9 on MS-COCO for text-to-image synthesis and best results on COCO-CN and AIC-ICC for image captioning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15283v1\", \"timestamp\": 1640922813, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0c9192aa-169e-4aff-a016-8895c705d77d\", \"authors\": [\"Zihao Wang\", \"Wei Liu\", \"Qian He\", \"Xinglong Wu\", \"Zili Yi\"], \"title\": \"CLIP-GEN: Language-Free Training of a Text-to-Image Generator with CLIP\", \"abstract\": \"Training a text-to-image generator in the general domain (e.g., Dall.e, CogView) requires huge amounts of paired text-image data, which is too expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named as CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator. Specifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the image encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the unlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision representation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image tokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon an input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general text-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly outperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality while not compromising the text-image matching.

We first demonstrate that a diffusion model trained to reconstruct an input image from frozen embeddings, can reconstruct the image with minor variations. Second, inspired by how text-to-image models learn from web-scale text-image pairs, we explore a new pretraining strategy to generate image variations using a large collection of image pairs. Our diffusion model \\\\textit{Semantica} receives a random (encoded) image from a webpage as conditional input and denoises another noisy random image from the same webpage. We carefully examine various design choices for the image encoder, given its crucial role in extracting relevant context from the input image.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\n\nRobot learning has made inspiring progress in recent years, resulting in robots that can cook\u00a0[1], clean up\u00a0[2], or even perform backflips\u00a0[3]. While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

Circulating currents represent unwanted currents flowing between parallel-connected conductors. This phenomenon is due to various reasons such as asymmetries in the winding and differences in electric potential between parallel-connected conductors. This effect occurs both at no-load and on-load conditions, and always lead to uneven distribution of the current between the parallel conductors, therefore leading to higher losses, as proven in the authors' previous work. Circulating currents are occurring mainly due to asymmetries and electric potential difference in the active part, meaning that long end windings are advantageous to mitigate the effect of circulating currents. Losses due to circulating currents decrease at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the end windings length. The aim of this paper is to mathematically prove this property and present a case study application in an electric machine.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07235v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731351270, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6bc4b87e-1d66-4ab5-9738-47bce96df1e9\", \"authors\": [\"Alexandra Lamtyugina\", \"Agnish Kumar Behera\", \"Aditya Nandy\", \"Carlos Floyd\", \"Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan\"], \"title\": \"Score-based generative diffusion with \\\"active\\\" correlated noise sources\", \"abstract\": \"Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the underlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the approximated distribution.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07229v1\", \"timestamp\": 1731350911, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent8", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session 670c4f4f-6999-49f9-8023-bc817f24c4ba\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session 670c4f4f-6999-49f9-8023-bc817f24c4ba \\nFrom agent8 to agent1: Hello, I am agent8.

It could lead to the development of robots that can perform complex physical tasks requiring high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making, and adaptability to opponent strategies. This research could pave the way for future advancements in robotics and contribute to practical applications in various domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed, and generality in a physically demanding sport like table tennis. The robot needs to master a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins, requiring both high-level strategic decisions and low-level physical skills. The complexity of the game and the need for the robot to not only decide but also execute actions pose technical and practical obstacles that need to be overcome.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on specific aspects of table tennis, such as returning the ball, hitting to target positions, or cooperative rallying. However, no prior work has tackled the challenge of a robot playing a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent. The gap in existing solutions lies in the lack of a comprehensive approach that combines high-level strategic decisions with low-level physical skills in a hierarchical and modular policy architecture.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hierarchical and modular policy architecture consisting of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, while the high-level controller selects between them. Training is efficient, building on a foundation policy and specializing skills as needed.

As a proxy for more complex problems, this short paper considers the problem where each robot must locally estimate the algebraic connectivity of the team's network topology.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03737v2\", \"timestamp\": 1525901090, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"4466761b-77d7-4eb3-8c9f-9b68d30f4385\", \"authors\": [\"Ali Ayub\", \"Alan R.

Similarly, robots can also implement this by imitation learning. Furthermore, if with external guidance, humans can master the new behavior more efficiently. So, how can robots achieve this? To address the issue, we present a novel framework named FIL. It provides a heterogeneous knowledge fusion mechanism for cloud robotic systems. Then, a knowledge fusion algorithm in FIL is proposed. It enables the cloud to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from local robots and generate guide models for robots with service requests. After that, we introduce a knowledge transfer scheme to facilitate local robots acquiring knowledge from the cloud. With FIL, a robot is capable of utilizing knowledge from other robots to increase its imitation learning in accuracy and efficiency. Compared with transfer learning and meta-learning, FIL is more suitable to be deployed in cloud robotic systems. Finally, we conduct experiments of a self-driving task for robots (cars). The experimental results demonstrate that the shared model generated by FIL increases imitation learning efficiency of local robots in cloud robotic systems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12204v1\", \"timestamp\": 1577186603, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c5e86573-bf15-4e23-991b-c1fadb3fa324\", \"authors\": [\"Dylan P.

We believe robots take optimal actions given their objective; hence, when we are uncertain about what the robot's objective is, we interpret the robot's actions as optimal with respect to our estimate of its objective. This approach makes sense when robots straightforwardly optimize their objective, and enables humans to learn what the robot is trying to achieve. However, our insight is that---when robots are aware that humans learn by trusting that the robot actions are rational---intelligent robots do not act as the human expects; instead, they take advantage of the human's trust, and exploit this trust to more efficiently optimize their own objective. In this paper, we formally model instances of human-robot interaction (HRI) where the human does not know the robot's objective using a two-player game. We formulate different ways in which the robot can model the uncertain human, and compare solutions of this game when the robot has conservative, optimistic, rational, and trusting human models. In an offline linear-quadratic case study and a real-time user study, we show that trusting human models can naturally lead to communicative robot behavior, which influences end-users and increases their involvement.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05777v1\", \"timestamp\": 1568304981, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9e128bf4-39a8-4434-878c-8006c4bce614\", \"authors\": [\"Sulabh Kumra\", \"Ferat Sahin\"], \"title\": \"Collaborative Robot Learning from Demonstrations using Hidden Markov Model State Distribution\", \"abstract\": \"In robotics, there is need of an interactive and expedite learning method as experience is expensive.

These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a; Liu et\u00a0al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), BART (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et\u00a0al., 2019; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et\u00a0al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples.

The most common and effective technique to solve this problem is transfer learning, where large language models, either pre-trained on text or task-specific data, are fine-tuned on the few samples. These methods require fine-tuning steps and a set of parameters for each task.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\u00a0(Krumm et\u00a0al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), news\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2018b) and e-commerce\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2020; Qin et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval. The latter will be detailed further in Section \u00a02.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in candidate sets (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly, utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements.

INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC)\u00a0(Krumm et\u00a0al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today\u2019s short video\u00a0(Liu et\u00a0al., 2019), news\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2018b) and e-commerce\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2020; Qin et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2023b; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions\u00a0(Pi et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature\u00a0(Qin et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., 2020d) and re-ranking\u00a0(Xi et\u00a0al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure\u00a01 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval. The latter will be detailed further in Section \u00a02.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in candidate sets (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly, utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements.

This paper concludes with the presentation of challenges that still need to be solved by future research in the field of online speaker diarization.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14464v1\", \"timestamp\": 1718900763, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ba911f69-1347-4fb8-9278-0db47c5b3272\", \"authors\": [\"Shota Horiguchi\", \"Yusuke Fujita\", \"Shinji Watanabe\", \"Yawen Xue\", \"Kenji Nagamatsu\"], \"title\": \"End-to-End Speaker Diarization for an Unknown Number of Speakers with Encoder-Decoder Based Attractors\", \"abstract\": \"End-to-end speaker diarization for an unknown number of speakers is addressed in this paper. Recently proposed end-to-end speaker diarization outperformed conventional clustering-based speaker diarization, but it has one drawback: it is less flexible in terms of the number of speakers. This paper proposes a method for encoder-decoder based attractor calculation (EDA), which first generates a flexible number of attractors from a speech embedding sequence. Then, the generated multiple attractors are multiplied by the speech embedding sequence to produce the same number of speaker activities. The speech embedding sequence is extracted using the conventional self-attentive end-to-end neural speaker diarization (SA-EEND) network. In a two-speaker condition, our method achieved a 2.69 % diarization error rate (DER) on simulated mixtures and a 8.07 % DER on the two-speaker subset of CALLHOME, while vanilla SA-EEND attained 4.56 % and 9.54 %, respectively. In unknown numbers of speakers conditions, our method attained a 15.29 % DER on CALLHOME, while the x-vector-based clustering method achieved a 19.43 % DER.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09921v3\", \"timestamp\": 1589965721, \"domain\": \"eess.AS\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"adfc4171-e0ab-48b6-a900-793f05f31ab7\", \"authors\": [\"Junyi Ao\", \"Mehmet Sinan Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m\", \"Ruijie Tao\", \"Meng Ge\", \"Shuai Wang\", \"Yanmin Qian\", \"Haizhou Li\"], \"title\": \"USED: Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization\", \"abstract\": \"Speaker extraction and diarization are two enabling techniques for real-world speech applications. Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's voice from a speech mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech segments by speaker, annotating `who spoke when'. Previous studies have typically treated the two tasks independently. In practical applications, it is more meaningful to have knowledge about `who spoke what and when', which is captured by the two tasks. The two tasks share a similar objective of disentangling speakers. Speaker extraction operates in the frequency domain, whereas diarization is in the temporal domain. It is logical to believe that speaker activities obtained from speaker diarization can benefit speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker activity detection than the speech mixture. In this paper, we propose a unified model called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED) to address output inconsistency and scenario mismatch issues. It is designed to manage speech mixture with varying overlap ratios and variable number of speakers. We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the competitive baselines for speaker extraction and diarization tasks on LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. We further validate the diarization performance on CALLHOME, a dataset based on real recordings, and experimental results indicate that our model surpasses recently proposed approaches.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10674v2\", \"timestamp\": 1695135391, \"domain\": \"cs.SD\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session 6fc6c854-c00a-421f-b5c5-48af298a2f3d\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session 6fc6c854-c00a-421f-b5c5-48af298a2f3d \\nFrom agent4 to agent1: I am interested in collaborating with you to brainstorm potential research ideas in the field of recommender systems and multi-stage cascade ranking systems.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nA critical concern with deep learning models arises from\ntheir well-known tendency to base their predictions on cor-\nrelations present in the training data rather than robustly\ninformative features (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Sagawa et al.,\n2020). For instance, in image classification, translating an\nimage by a few pixels (Azulay & Weiss, 2019) or modifying\nthe background spurious correlations. We hypothesize\nthat because of this, on CMNIST and CelebA (Table 1),\nwhere concepts are less spatially separable, our method\u2019s\nbenefit is a bit limited compared to other datasets like Water-\nbirds, Urban Cars, Bar (Nam et al., 2020) (Table 6), whereconcepts have clear spatial regions. Further investigation in\nthis direction is needed. In principle, one could try to learn a\ndisentangled representation of the high level objects and use\nthe disentangled factors of variations as concept. Work like\nSingh et al. (2022) that further factorizes the representation\nof each semantic region can be used to mitigate this issue by\nallowing one spatial region to be represented as a collection\nof concepts.\n4.2.7. A VOIDING REPRESENTATION COLLAPSE\nOur concept discovery method is based on self-supervised\nSiamese representation learning, utilizing two parallel en-\ncoders: the student produces the source slot encoding and\nthe teacher produces the target encoding. One of the main\nissues with this kind of encoder-only learning framework is\nrepresentation collapse (Hua et al., 2021). During training,\nour method can obtain a degenerate solution in which all\nrepresentations of the slots fall into one cluster, while still\nminimizing the objective in Equation 5.\nTo avoid this degenerate case, we employ a similar set of\nideas as DINO (Caron et al., 2021) to have asymmetric\nteacher and student branches: 1) using data augmentations\nof teacher and student views; 2) centering and sharpening\nof teacher slot distributions; 3) updating teacher weights by\ntaking an exponential moving average of student. Typically,\nthe teacher model\u2019s weights are updated after every gradient\nupdate step for most datasets. However, for the CMNIST\ndatasets, data augmentation is not used. To maintain the\nasymmetry between the teacher and student models in the\nabsence of data augmentation, the updates for the CMNIST\ndatasets are performed less frequently, specifically after\nevery 20 steps.\n5. related work in Section 2). Our approach models concepts\nthat do not necessarily correspond directly to subgroups;\ntypically, we use a significantly larger number of concepts\nthan annotated subgroups in the dataset.\nThis paper demonstrates the use of object-centric represen-\ntation learning approaches to design classifiers robust to\nspurious correlations without the need for human-labeled\nsubgroup annotations. We introduce CoBalT, a method\ncombining concept discovery with concept balancing for\nrobust classification.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7.

Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

Addressing this challenge can lead to advancements in deep joint source-channel coding strategies and adaptive frameworks, ultimately improving the performance and reliability of data transmission in such networks. This research has the potential to impact future studies in the field of efficient data transmission and can pave the way for practical applications in real-world network scenarios.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe variability in link qualities between wireless and wired segments introduces complexities that require a robust transmission scheme. Existing deep joint source-channel coding strategies may struggle at the intersection of analog and digital methods, making it challenging to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, the need for a fully adaptive framework adds another layer of complexity, as it involves addressing variable rate compression and adapting to changing network conditions. Overcoming these challenges requires innovative approaches and a deep understanding of the underlying technical and theoretical obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research may have limitations in addressing the specific challenges posed by the variability in link qualities and the need for a fully adaptive framework in mobile multi-hop networks. Barriers such as the complexity of integrating deep joint source-channel coding strategies, the lack of efficient adaptive frameworks, and the difficulty in achieving optimal performance in varying network conditions may have hindered previous solutions. Our approach aims to improve upon existing work by introducing a fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework that addresses these limitations and provides a more effective solution for data transmission in mobile multi-hop networks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework that incorporates variable rate compression and adapts to changing network conditions. We plan to use a combination of pre-trained models, learnable parameters, and adaptive strategies to optimize data transmission performance. The dataset will consist of simulated network scenarios with varying link qualities, and we will evaluate the performance using metrics such as rate-distortion performance and entropy estimation.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nImage restoration aims at reconstructing a high-quality image from its low-quality observation. Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al.

It can have broader implications for improving the efficiency and accuracy of planning algorithms, thus impacting future research in the field. Addressing this question could advance knowledge by overcoming the current limitations and potentially lead to practical applications in various domains that rely on automated planning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in finding solutions that can effectively handle complex logical features required for learning policies in planning domains. Naive approaches may fail due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing the necessary expressive power. Technical obstacles include the need for richer grammars or more advanced techniques like k-GNNs to overcome these limitations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by the expressive constraints of current methods, such as description logics and GNNs, which struggle with learning policies requiring complex logical features.

In this work, we study generalized policy search-based methods with a focus on the score function used to guide the search over policies. We demonstrate limitations of two score functions and propose a new approach that overcomes these limitations. The main idea behind our approach, Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generation (PG3), is that a candidate policy should be used to guide planning on training problems as a mechanism for evaluating that candidate. Theoretical results in a simplified setting give conditions under which PG3 is optimal or admissible. We then study a specific instantiation of policy search where planning problems are PDDL-based and policies are lifted decision lists. Empirical results in six domains confirm that PG3 learns generalized policies more efficiently and effectively than several baselines.

We also evaluate the resulting approach experimentally over a number of benchmark domains in FOND planning, present the general policies that result in some of these domains, and prove their correctness. The method for learning general policies for FOND planning can actually be seen as an alternative FOND planning method that searches for solutions, not in the given state space but in an abstract space defined by features that must be learned as well.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02499v2\", \"timestamp\": 1712125542, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"a17338d4-82b3-4d31-81cc-1e65e24b8e7b\", \"authors\": [\"A.

This is advantageous in domains where good policies are easier to represent and learn than the corresponding value functions, which is often the case for the relational MDPs we are interested in. In order to apply API to such problems, we introduce a relational policy language and corresponding learner. In addition, we introduce a new bootstrapping routine for goal-based planning domains, based on random walks. Such bootstrapping is necessary for many large relational MDPs, where reward is extremely sparse, as API is ineffective in such domains when initialized with an uninformed policy. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able to find good policies for a number of classical planning domains and their stochastic variants by solving them as extremely large relational MDPs.

However they plan on a pre-specified static environment representation, and are not scalable to unseen dynamic environments. Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as they incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies directly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can successfully plan across different environments. However none of the existing NMPs generalize across robot embodiments. In this paper we propose Cross-Embodiment Motion Policy (XMoP), a neural policy for learning to plan over a distribution of manipulators. XMoP implicitly learns to satisfy kinematic constraints for a distribution of robots and $\\\\textit{zero-shot}$ transfers the planning behavior to unseen robotic manipulators within this distribution. We achieve this generalization by formulating a whole-body control policy that is trained on planning demonstrations from over three million procedurally sampled robotic manipulators in different simulated environments. Despite being completely trained on synthetic embodiments and environments, our policy exhibits strong sim-to-real generalization across manipulators with different kinematic variations and degrees of freedom with a single set of frozen policy parameters. We evaluate XMoP on $7$ commercial manipulators and show successful cross-embodiment motion planning, achieving an average $70\\\\%$ success rate on baseline benchmarks.

Mapless online path planning is particularly of practical appeal but poses a challenge for safely overtaking opponents due to the limited planning horizon. To address this, we introduce RaceMOP, a novel method for mapless online path planning designed for multi-agent racing of F1TENTH cars. Unlike classical planners that rely on predefined racing lines, RaceMOP operates without a map, utilizing only local observations to execute high-speed overtaking maneuvers. Our approach combines an artificial potential field method as a base policy with residual policy learning to enable long-horizon planning. We advance the field by introducing a novel approach for policy fusion with the residual policy directly in probability space. Extensive experiments on twelve simulated racetracks validate that RaceMOP is capable of long-horizon decision-making with robust collision avoidance during overtaking maneuvers. RaceMOP demonstrates superior handling over existing mapless planners and generalizes to unknown racetracks, affirming its potential for broader applications in robotics.

The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs).

We leverage human annotation and an automatic pipeline we created to generate a multimodal dataset, and introduce two novel tasks as a benchmark for multimodal figurative language understanding. We experimented with state-of-the-art vision and language models and found that the best (22%) performed substantially worse than humans (97%). We release our dataset, benchmark, and code, in hopes of driving the development of models that can better understand figurative language.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15445v3\", \"timestamp\": 1679939995, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"4a2c3bc1-869f-4521-b9d4-b97395aeae3c\", \"authors\": [\"Naman Sharma\"], \"title\": \"CXR-Agent: Vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation with uncertainty aware radiology reporting\", \"abstract\": \"Recently large vision-language models have shown potential when interpreting complex images and generating natural language descriptions using advanced reasoning. Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stress the importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately.

We introduce a new approach to explain speech classification models. We generate easy-to-interpret explanations via input perturbation on two information levels. 1) Word-level explanations reveal how each word-related audio segment impacts the outcome. 2) Paralinguistic features (e.g., prosody and background noise) answer the counterfactual: ``What would the model prediction be if we edited the audio signal in this way?'' We validate our approach by explaining two state-of-the-art SLU models on two speech classification tasks in English and Italian.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters.

We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\nModels Drop rate AlpacaEval GSM8K MBPP Average\nLM +\nMath0.1 0.805 0.599 / 0.702\n0.3 0.812 0.629 / 0.721\n0.5 0.804 0.645 / 0.724\n0.7 0.787 0.611 / 0.699\n0.9 0.683 0.455 / 0.570\nLM +\nCode0.1 0.741 / 0 0.370\n0.3 0.770 / 0 0.385\n0.5 0.802 / 0.152 0.477\n0.7 0.798 / 0.34 0.569\n0.9 0.737 / 0.262 0.500\nMath +\nCode0.1 / 0.619 0.166 0.393\n0.3 / 0.618 0.184 0.401\n0.5 / 0.626 0.206 0.416\n0.7 / 0.633 0.19 0.412\n0.9 / 0.622 0.128 0.375\nLM +\nMath +\nCode0.1 0.732 0.545 0.114 0.464\n0.3 0.766 0.623 0.302 0.564\n0.5 0.794 0.630 0.3 0.575\n0.7 0.770 0.622 0.23 0.541\n0.9 0.688 0.446 0.128 0.421\nTable 7: Drop Rate of parameters against Task perfor-\nmance Appendix\nA.1 Importance of GPT4-as-a-judge for Math\ntasks - Example\nQuestion: Each person in a certain\nhousehold consumes 0.2 kg of rice ev-\nery meal.

We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE .

This system comprises an anti-loss smart helmet, a cloud computing module, and an intelligent early warning application on the caregiver's mobile device. The smart helmet integrates a miniature camera module, a GPS module, and a 5G communication module to collect first-person images and location information of the elderly. Data is transmitted remotely via 5G, FTP, and TCP protocols. In the cloud computing module, our team has proposed for the first time a multimodal dangerous state recognition network based on scene and location information to accurately assess the risk of elderly individuals going missing. Finally, the application software interface designed for the caregiver's mobile device implements multi-level early warnings. The system developed by our team requires no operation or response from the elderly, achieving fully automatic environmental perception, risk assessment, and proactive alarming. This overcomes the limitations of traditional monitoring devices, which require active operation and response, thus avoiding the issue of the digital divide for the elderly. It effectively prevents accidental loss and potential dangers for elderly individuals with dementia.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20136v1\", \"timestamp\": 1717081938, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c922b9c5-ae2e-46f3-b706-099ed9fcc754\", \"authors\": [\"Abderrahim Bourouis\", \"Mohamed Feham\", \"Abdelhamid Bouchachia\"], \"title\": \"Ubiquitous Mobile Health Monitoring System for Elderly (UMHMSE)\", \"abstract\": \"Recent research in ubiquitous computing uses technologies of Body Area Networks (BANs) to monitor the person's kinematics and physiological parameters.

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

The generative model is an auto-decoder that learns to synthesize graphs from latent codes. The graph synthesis model is learned jointly with an empirical distribution over the latent codes. Graphs are synthesized using self-attention modules that are trained to identify likely connectivity patterns. Graph-based normalizing flows are used to sample latent codes from the distribution learned by the auto-decoder. The resulting model combines accuracy and scalability. On benchmark datasets of large graphs, the presented model outperforms the state of the art by a factor of 1.5 in mean accuracy and average rank across at least three different graph statistics, with a 2x speedup during inference.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02879v1\", \"timestamp\": 1591280581, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:Based on your expertise in enhancing the robustness and performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through innovative approaches to graph structure learning, the next task is to collaborate with the research team to formulate a new research idea in the format of the '5q'.

The core of recommender system is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate, purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n(CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\nprediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6,19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user \u2014 more specifically, her one-hop neighbors \u2014 to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al. [ 39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network (GCN) [ 14,23], following the samearXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020propagation rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation, and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results of the 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n\u2022The best setting in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n\u2022The second best setting is using L1normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e., LightGCN- L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n\u2022Normalizing symmetrically on two sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness. As we have analyzed\nin Section 3.2.3, a 2-layer LightGCN smooths a user\u2019s embedding\nbased on the users that have overlap on her interacted items, and\nthe smoothing strength between two users cv\u2192uis measured in\nEquation (14). We speculate that such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN\u2019s effectiveness. To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU=MX\nu=1MX\nv=1cv\u2192u(eu\n||eu||2\u2212ev\n||ev||2)2, (17)\nwhere the L2norm on embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding\u2019s scale. Similarly we can obtained the\ndefinition for item embeddings. Table 6 shows the smoothness\nof two models, matrix factorization (i.e., using the E(0)for model\nprediction) and the 2-layer LightGCN-single (i.e., using the E(2)for\nprediction). Note that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is much lower\nthan that of MF.

This method can lead to improved learning rates and social welfare by abstaining from recommending choices when multiple alternatives yield similar outcomes. Addressing this question could advance the field of recommender systems by optimizing user choice and system performance.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in accurately predicting user choices and determining when to abstain from recommendations to enhance learning. Naive approaches may struggle to balance user preferences and system learning, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Technical obstacles include developing algorithms that can effectively incorporate deviation-based learning principles into existing recommender systems.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on traditional recommendation methods, overlooking the potential benefits of deviation-based learning. The complexity of modeling user knowledge and system recommendations in a dynamic environment may have hindered the exploration of this approach. By introducing a new perspective on training recommender systems, this research can fill a gap in existing literature and offer a fresh solution to enhance user choice.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves implementing deviation-based learning principles in training recommender systems, analyzing user choices, and optimizing recommendations based on predicted outcomes.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1. Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2.

Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the \u201dnerfacto\u201d model implemented by Nerfstudio (Tancik et\u00a0al., 2023), which is a combination of modular features from multiple papers (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021; Barron et\u00a0al., 2022; M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et\u00a0al., 2021; Verbin et\u00a0al., 2022)\n, designed to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2. Related Work\n\n\n2.1. Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels.

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13168v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700630675, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"395000c1-8bd8-4565-9a25-19207a9de98b\", \"authors\": [\"Zijiang Yang\", \"Zhongwei Qiu\", \"Chang Xu\", \"Dongmei Fu\"], \"title\": \"MM-NeRF: Multimodal-Guided 3D Multi-Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Field\", \"abstract\": \"3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, and keeps multi-view consistency and style consistency between multimodal guidance.

To this end, we take advantage of a generalizable NeRF model to facilitate style transfer in 3D, thereby enabling the use of a single learned model across various scenes. By incorporating a hypernetwork into a generalizable NeRF, our approach enables on-the-fly generation of stylized novel views.

We evaluate our method across various scenes and artistic styles and show its performance in generating high-quality and multi-view consistent stylized images without the need for a scene-specific implicit model.

Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer.

The well-known reason for death  of this pandemic  is obstacles in oxygen intake \ndue to inflammation lung, filled air sacs with discharge and fluid  [3]. Early  identification of the  COVID can  not \nonly reduce  death  rate sharply, but also most prone  to faster recovery  phase  [1]. \nFor the first time in the December of 2019, the sick persons  infected with COVID -19 were identified in Wuhan, \nChina  [4]. Often, the patients develop a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, weariness , sore throat, pains, runny \nnose, body aches, and diarrhoea symptoms.  High fever and dry cough are its core symptoms  [3]. Its symptoms \nare similar to pneumonia and influenza- A that affect the human respiratory tract and lungs  [1, 5] . Since the \nseparation of infection between COVID -19 and bacterial pneumonia is not an easy task, the automatic feature \nextraction from images can help to diagnose the disease [6].

Among interpretable models, rule lists are among the best-known and easily interpretable ones. However, finding optimal rule lists is computationally challenging, and current approaches are impractical for large datasets.   We present a novel and scalable approach to learn nearly optimal rule lists from large datasets. Our algorithm uses sampling to efficiently obtain an approximation of the optimal rule list with rigorous guarantees on the quality of the approximation. In particular, our algorithm guarantees to find a rule list with accuracy very close to the optimal rule list when a rule list with high accuracy exists. Our algorithm builds on the VC-dimension of rule lists, for which we prove novel upper and lower bounds. Our experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that our algorithm identifies nearly optimal rule lists with a speed-up up to two orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art exact approaches. Moreover, our algorithm is as fast as, and sometimes faster than, recent heuristic approaches, while reporting higher quality rule lists.

This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that $M_\\\\bullet \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies.

To remedy this, we present contextualized evaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding an underspecified query and provides it during evaluation.

It can open up new possibilities for more accurate modeling and analysis of complex relational data structures.\n\n[Question 3] - Why is it hard?\n\nThe challenge lies in developing models that can effectively capture and utilize relational information from multiple tables in RDBs. Naive approaches may struggle to handle the complexity and interconnected nature of the data, requiring sophisticated techniques to overcome these obstacles.\n\n[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\n\nThe lack of established benchmarks for evaluating predictive ML models of RDB data, along with privacy concerns and restricted access to RDBs, have hindered progress in this area. Existing approaches have focused on either graph learning or tabular modeling, but head-to-head comparisons on unfiltered RDB/multi-table data are lacking.\n\n[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n\nOur proposed research idea aims to develop a generic supervised learning formulation for handling dynamic RDBs in both inductive and transductive settings.

The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information. The proposed approach\nachieves not only enhanced accuracy in identifying malicious\npayloads, but also pushes the boundaries of current methodolo-\ngies that help distinguish malicious payload types by employing\ntwo different classification heads.\nII. D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata.

D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata. Similarly, we randomly select an equal number of benign\npayload entries as malicious entries to balance the final dataset.\nThe benign entries are labeled as 0.
