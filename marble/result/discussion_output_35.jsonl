{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The design of classical reinforcement learning\u00a0(RL) algorithms primarily focuses on the expectation of cumulative rewards that an agent observes while interacting with the environment. Recently, a new class of RL algorithms called distributional RL estimates the full distribution of total returns and has exhibited state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of environments, such as C51\u00a0[5], Quantile-Regression DQN\u00a0(QR-DQN)\u00a0[14], EDRL\u00a0[41], Implicit Quantile Networks\u00a0(IQN)\u00a0[13], Fully Parameterized Quantile Function\u00a0(FQF)\u00a0[56], Non-Crossing QR-DQN\u00a0[58], Maximum Mean Discrepancy\u00a0(MMD-DQN)\u00a0[37], Spline\u00a0(SPL-DQN)\u00a0[33], and Sketch-DQN\u00a0[53]. Beyond the performance advantage, distributional RL has also possessed benefits in risk-sensitive control\u00a0[13, 9], exploration\u00a0[35, 11, 48], offline setting\u00a0[34, 55], statistical value estimation\u00a0[43], robustness\u00a0[47] and optimization\u00a0[46, 52, 42, 51].   Limitations of Typical Distributional RL Algorithms.  Despite the gradual introduction of numerous algorithms, quantile regression-based algorithms\u00a0[14, 13, 56, 41, 33, 42, 43] dominate attention and research in the realm of distributional RL. These algorithms utilize quantile regression to approximate the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance to compare two return distributions. Nevertheless, two major limitations hinder their performance improvement and wider practical deployment. 1) Inaccuracy in Capturing Return Distribution Characteristics. The way of directly generating quantiles of return distributions via neural networks often suffers from the non-crossing issue\u00a0[58], where the learned quantile curves fail to guarantee a non-decreasing property. This leads to abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability. The inaccurate distribution estimate is fundamentally attributed to the use of pre-specified statistics\u00a0[41], while unrestricted statistics based on deterministic samples can be potentially more effective in complex environments\u00a0[37]. 2) Difficulties in Extension to Multi-dimensional Rewards. Many RL tasks involve multiple sources of rewards\u00a0[32, 15], hybrid reward architecture\u00a0[50, 30], or sub-reward structures after reward decomposition\u00a0[31, 57], which require learning multi-dimensional return distributions to reduce the intrinsic uncertainty of the environments. However, it remains elusive how to use quantile regressions to approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance, while circumventing the computational intractability issue in the related multi-dimensional output space.   Motivation of Sinkhorn Divergence: a Regularized Wasserstein loss. Sinkhorn divergence\u00a0[45] has emerged as a theoretically principled and computationally efficient alternative for approximating Wasserstein distance. It has gained increasing attention in the field of optimal transport\u00a0[4, 24, 21, 39] and has been successfully applied in various areas of machine learning\u00a0[38, 25, 54, 20, 8]. By introducing entropic regularization, Sinkhorn divergence can efficiently approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance using computationally efficient matrix scaling algorithms\u00a0[45, 39]. This makes it feasible to apply optimal transport distances to RL tasks with multi-dimensional rewards\u00a0(see experiments in Section\u00a05.3). Moreover, Sinkhorn divergence enables the leverage of samples to approximate return distributions instead of relying on pre-specified statistics, e.g., quantiles, thereby increasing the accuracy in capturing the full data complexity behind return distributions and naturally avoiding the non-crossing issues in distributional RL. Beyond addressing the two main limitations mentioned above, the well-controlled regularization introduced in Sinkrhorn divergence helps to find a \u201csmoother\u201d transport plan relative to Wasserstein distance, making it less sensitive to noises or small perturbations when comparing two return distributions\u00a0(see Appendix\u00a0A for the visualization). The term \"smoother\" refers to the effect of regularization in Sinkhorn divergence to encourage a more uniformly distributed transport plan.

Recently, a new class of RL algorithms called distributional RL estimates the full distribution of total returns and has exhibited state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of environments, such as C51\u00a0[5], Quantile-Regression DQN\u00a0(QR-DQN)\u00a0[14], EDRL\u00a0[41], Implicit Quantile Networks\u00a0(IQN)\u00a0[13], Fully Parameterized Quantile Function\u00a0(FQF)\u00a0[56], Non-Crossing QR-DQN\u00a0[58], Maximum Mean Discrepancy\u00a0(MMD-DQN)\u00a0[37], Spline\u00a0(SPL-DQN)\u00a0[33], and Sketch-DQN\u00a0[53]. Beyond the performance advantage, distributional RL has also possessed benefits in risk-sensitive control\u00a0[13, 9], exploration\u00a0[35, 11, 48], offline setting\u00a0[34, 55], statistical value estimation\u00a0[43], robustness\u00a0[47] and optimization\u00a0[46, 52, 42, 51].   Limitations of Typical Distributional RL Algorithms.  Despite the gradual introduction of numerous algorithms, quantile regression-based algorithms\u00a0[14, 13, 56, 41, 33, 42, 43] dominate attention and research in the realm of distributional RL. These algorithms utilize quantile regression to approximate the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance to compare two return distributions. Nevertheless, two major limitations hinder their performance improvement and wider practical deployment. 1) Inaccuracy in Capturing Return Distribution Characteristics. The way of directly generating quantiles of return distributions via neural networks often suffers from the non-crossing issue\u00a0[58], where the learned quantile curves fail to guarantee a non-decreasing property. This leads to abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability. The inaccurate distribution estimate is fundamentally attributed to the use of pre-specified statistics\u00a0[41], while unrestricted statistics based on deterministic samples can be potentially more effective in complex environments\u00a0[37]. 2) Difficulties in Extension to Multi-dimensional Rewards. Many RL tasks involve multiple sources of rewards\u00a0[32, 15], hybrid reward architecture\u00a0[50, 30], or sub-reward structures after reward decomposition\u00a0[31, 57], which require learning multi-dimensional return distributions to reduce the intrinsic uncertainty of the environments. However, it remains elusive how to use quantile regressions to approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance, while circumventing the computational intractability issue in the related multi-dimensional output space.   Motivation of Sinkhorn Divergence: a Regularized Wasserstein loss. Sinkhorn divergence\u00a0[45] has emerged as a theoretically principled and computationally efficient alternative for approximating Wasserstein distance. It has gained increasing attention in the field of optimal transport\u00a0[4, 24, 21, 39] and has been successfully applied in various areas of machine learning\u00a0[38, 25, 54, 20, 8]. By introducing entropic regularization, Sinkhorn divergence can efficiently approximate a multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance using computationally efficient matrix scaling algorithms\u00a0[45, 39]. This makes it feasible to apply optimal transport distances to RL tasks with multi-dimensional rewards\u00a0(see experiments in Section\u00a05.3). Moreover, Sinkhorn divergence enables the leverage of samples to approximate return distributions instead of relying on pre-specified statistics, e.g., quantiles, thereby increasing the accuracy in capturing the full data complexity behind return distributions and naturally avoiding the non-crossing issues in distributional RL. Beyond addressing the two main limitations mentioned above, the well-controlled regularization introduced in Sinkrhorn divergence helps to find a \u201csmoother\u201d transport plan relative to Wasserstein distance, making it less sensitive to noises or small perturbations when comparing two return distributions\u00a0(see Appendix\u00a0A for the visualization). The term \"smoother\" refers to the effect of regularization in Sinkhorn divergence to encourage a more uniformly distributed transport plan. This regularization also aligns with the maximum-entropy principle\u00a0[28, 16], which\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Recent trends, however, have shifted toward task-agnostic, universal representations that may be easily fine-tuned or even have zero-shot capabilities out-of-the-box. Supervised learning, stricto sensu, is too limited a framework for these billion-parameter, data-hungry models, and a question at the heart of modern machine learning is learning from unlabelled, partially labeled, or weakly labeled data.   This need has paved the way for the current generation of self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that circumvent the need for large amounts of strong labels. In SSL, a model is trained on a generic pseudo-task that can be performed on unlabelled data, such as relating the two modalities of an image-caption pair or two augmentations of the same image. Despite several modern foundation models such as DINO (Caron et\u00a0al., 2021; Oquab et\u00a0al., 2024) and CLIP (Radford et\u00a0al., 2021) being trained in this fashion, many aspects of SSL remain baffling.   In particular, the training process of self-supervised models often outgrows and \u201cbreaks the rules\u201d of the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) toolkit. ERM combines two well-understood techniques: minibatch sampling and gradient-based optimization using backpropagation. SSL, on the other hand, adds clever, less-understood techniques to the training pipeline. To illustrate this, consider a minibatch \u2133n={Z1,\u2026,Zn}subscript\u2133\ud835\udc5bsubscript\ud835\udc4d1\u2026subscript\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc5b\\mathcal{M}_{n}=\\left\\{Z_{1},\\ldots,Z_{n}\\right\\}caligraphic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , \u2026 , italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } of training examples and let Pnsubscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5bP_{n}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT be the empirical distribution of the minibatch.

The algorithm then proceeds with the stochastic gradient training, or a variant thereof.   On the other hand, self-supervised methods often modify this recipe by intervening on the optimization algorithm in a minibatch-specific way. For example, SwaV (Caron et\u00a0al., 2020) passes the minibatch examples through the model\u2019s encoder and clusters output vectors to generate pseudo-labels for a prediction task. In teacher-student architectures such as BYOL (Grill et\u00a0al., 2020) and DINO (Caron et\u00a0al., 2021), the data are passed through two networks, where the \u201cstudent\u201d is updated via backpropagation and the \u201cteacher\u201d is updated by cloning the student\u2019s weights in regular intervals. In CLIP (Radford et\u00a0al., 2021), a model optimizes the sum of two cross entropy loss terms, where the predicted class probabilities on example i\ud835\udc56iitalic_i are generated by comparison to all other elements of the minibatch. These steps are often motivated as constraints to avoid representation collapse, wherein the pseudo-task can be solved by a trivial representation, e.g.\u00a0mapping all data to the zero vector. Conceptually, however, it is difficult to see what exactly is being optimized when introducing\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Recent trends, however, have shifted toward task-agnostic, universal representations that may be easily fine-tuned or even have zero-shot capabilities out-of-the-box. Supervised learning, stricto sensu, is too limited a framework for these billion-parameter, data-hungry models, and a question at the heart of modern machine learning is learning from unlabelled, partially labeled, or weakly labeled data.   This need has paved the way for the current generation of self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that circumvent the need for large amounts of strong labels. In SSL, a model is trained on a generic pseudo-task that can be performed on unlabelled data, such as relating the two modalities of an image-caption pair or two augmentations of the same image. Despite several modern foundation models such as DINO (Caron et\u00a0al., 2021; Oquab et\u00a0al., 2024) and CLIP (Radford et\u00a0al., 2021) being trained in this fashion, many aspects of SSL remain baffling.   In particular, the training process of self-supervised models often outgrows and \u201cbreaks the rules\u201d of the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) toolkit. ERM combines two well-understood techniques: minibatch sampling and gradient-based optimization using backpropagation.

The algorithm then proceeds with the stochastic gradient training, or a variant thereof.   On the other hand, self-supervised methods often modify this recipe by intervening on the optimization algorithm in a minibatch-specific way. For example, SwaV (Caron et\u00a0al., 2020) passes the minibatch examples through the model\u2019s encoder and clusters output vectors to generate pseudo-labels for a prediction task. In teacher-student architectures such as BYOL (Grill et\u00a0al., 2020) and DINO (Caron et\u00a0al., 2021), the data are passed through two networks, where the \u201cstudent\u201d is updated via backpropagation and the \u201cteacher\u201d is updated by cloning the student\u2019s weights in regular intervals. In CLIP (Radford et\u00a0al., 2021), a model optimizes the sum of two cross entropy loss terms, where the predicted class probabilities on example i\ud835\udc56iitalic_i are generated by comparison to all other elements of the minibatch. These steps are often motivated as constraints to avoid representation collapse, wherein the pseudo-task can be solved by a trivial representation, e.g.\u00a0mapping all data to the zero vector. Conceptually, however, it is difficult to see what exactly is being optimized when introducing\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Meta-learning can be applied to improve model generalization capability and to construct general AI algorithms. Self-supervised learning utilizes self-supervision from original data and extracts higher-level generalizable features through unsupervised pre-training or optimization of contrastive loss objectives. In self-supervised learning, data augmentation techniques are widely applied and data labels are not required since pseudo labels can be estimated from trained models on similar tasks. Meta-learning aims to adapt trained deep models to solve diverse tasks and to develop general AI algorithms. We review the associations of meta-learning with both generative and contrastive self-supervised learning models. Unlabeled data from multiple sources can be jointly considered even when data sources are vastly different. We show that an integration of meta-learning and self-supervised learning models can best contribute to the improvement of model generalization capability.

We also explore the effectiveness of alternative online data augmentation strategies on both the time domain and frequency domain.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  What capabilities are necessary for general intelligence (Legg & Hutter, 2007)? One candidate is causal reasoning, which plays a foundational role in human cognition (Gopnik et\u00a0al., 2007; Sloman & Lagnado, 2015). It has even been argued that human-level AI is impossible without causal reasoning (Pearl, 2018). However, recent years have seen the development of agents that do not explicitly learn or reason on causal models, but nonetheless are capable of adapting to a wide range of environments and tasks (Reed et\u00a0al., 2022; Team et\u00a0al., 2023; Brown et\u00a0al., 2020).   This raises the question, do agents have to learn causal models in order to adapt to new domains, or are other inductive biases sufficient? To answer this question, we have to be careful not to assume that agents use causal assumptions a priori. For example, transportability theory determines what causal knowledge is necessary for transfer learning when all assumptions on the data generating process (inductive biases) can be expressed as constraints on causal structure (Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016). However, deep learning algorithms can exploit a much larger set of inductive biases (Neyshabur et\u00a0al., 2014; Battaglia et\u00a0al., 2018; Rahaman et\u00a0al., 2019; Goyal & Bengio, 2022) which in many real-world settings may be sufficient to identify low regret policies without requiring causal knowledge.   The main result of this paper is to answer this question by showing that,  Any agent capable of adapting to a sufficiently large set of distributional shifts must have learned a causal model of the data generating process.    Here, adapting to a distributional shift means learning a policy that satisfies a regret bound following an intervention on the data generating process\u2014for example, changing the distribution of features or latent variables. It is known that a causal model of the data generating process can be used to identify regret-bounded policies following a distributional shift (sufficiency), with more accurate models allowing lower regret policies to be found. We prove the converse (necessity)\u2014given regret-bounded policies for a large set of distributional shifts, we can learn an approximate causal model of the data generating process, with the approximation becoming exact for optimal policies. Hence, learning a causal model of the data generating process is necessary for robust adaptation.   This has consequences for a number of fields and questions. For one, it implies that causal identification laws also constrain domain adaptation. For example, we show that adapting to covariate and label shifts is only possible if the causal relations between features and labels can be identified from the training data\u2014a non-trivial causal discovery problem. This provides further theoretical justification for causal representation learning (Sch\u00f6lkopf et\u00a0al., 2021), showing that learning causal representations is necessary for achieving strong robustness guarantees. Our result also implies that we can learn causal models from adaptive agents. We demonstrate this by solving a causal discovery task on synthetic data by observing the policy of a regret-bounded agent under distributional shifts. More speculatively, our results suggest that causal models could play a role in emergent capabilities. Agents trained to minimise a loss function across many domains are incentivized to learn a causal world model, which could in turn enable them to solve a much larger set of decision tasks they were not explicitly trained on.

We analyze our method across SAE sparsity, SAE width, language model size, LoRA rank, and model layer on the Gemma Scope family of SAEs. In these settings, our method reduces the cross entropy loss gap by 30% to 55% when SAEs are inserted during the forward pass.

To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax), which replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax can be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures. Experimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only achieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve performance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an analysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus attention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although models that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length generalization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some of this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either during or after pretraining.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19399v1\", \"timestamp\": 1738349735, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2582b499-a861-4296-8b3b-ff8b7d7f0b62\", \"authors\": [\"Mustafa O.

In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities.

In this paper, we first define causal estimands that are identified and estimable from a single experiment on the network under minimal assumptions on the structure of interference, and which represent average partial causal responses which generally vary with other global features of the realized assignment. Under a fixed-population, design-based approach, we show unbiasedness, consistency and asymptotic normality for inverse-probability weighting (IPW) estimators for those causal parameters from a randomized experiment on a single network.

Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to \\\"optimally\\\" compress the information that cannot be predicted.

TIS likens intelligence to a calculus, differentiating, correlating and integrating information. Intelligence operates at many levels and scales and TIS distils these into a parsimonious macroscopic framework centered on solving, planning and their optimization to accomplish goals.

Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. This lack of causal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tools module, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct framework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for these four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. Our methodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80%.

We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (~ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans.

The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the potential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering interpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel causal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize data-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of a more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of three integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and LLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a dynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible causal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two demonstrations on seven well-known datasets.

A causal model is given by such a diagram with its components interpreted as stochastic maps, functions, or general channels in a symmetric monoidal category with a 'copy-discard' structure (cd-category), turning a model into a single mathematical object that can be reasoned with intuitively and yet rigorously. Building on prior works by Fong and Jacobs, Kissinger and Zanasi, as well as Fritz and Klingler, we present diagrammatic definitions of causal models and functional causal models in a cd-category, generalising causal Bayesian networks and structural causal models, respectively. We formalise general interventions on a model, including but beyond do-interventions, and present the natural notion of an open causal model with inputs. We also give an approach to conditioning based on a normalisation box, allowing for causal inference calculations to be done fully diagrammatically. We define counterfactuals in this setup, and treat the problems of the identifiability of causal effects and counterfactuals fully diagrammatically. The benefits of such a presentation of causal models lie in foundational questions in causal reasoning and in their clarificatory role and pedagogical value.

While attempts to generalize CFM and diffusion models to discrete categorical data have been made, they typically exert ad hoc assumptions on the structure of the discrete distribution. One group of work relies on stochastic jumps of Markov chains in either the discrete-time [6, 37, 1] or continuous-time setting [12, 51, 13] that discards the continuous nature of the underlying categorical distributions. Other work directly works with the probability simplex [7, 56] or the corresponding logit space [27, 38, 23] with potentially imperfect assumptions that fail to capitulate the underlying true geometry of the statistical manifold. Furthermore, likelihood is often approximated by variational bounds in previous discrete generative models due to the lack of tractable exact likelihood.   We propose to incorporate the intrinsic geometry of the statistical manifold by viewing categorical data as points on the statistical manifold of categorical distributions. Inspired by the mathematical results from information theory, we utilize the Fisher information metric [48] to naturally equip such a manifold with a Riemannian structure and develop an efficient generative training scheme for learning the vector fields without stability issues. We summarize our contributions as the following:   (1) We propose Statistical Flow Matching (SFM), a novel and mathematically rigorous generative framework on the manifold of parameterized probability measures. SFM does not pose any prior assumptions on the statistical manifold but instead deduces its intrinsic geometry via mathematical tools. To tackle the discrete generation problem, we instantiate SFM on the manifold of categorical distributions. We deduce closed-form exponential and logarithm maps and develop an efficient flow-matching training algorithm that avoids numerical issues by leveraging a diffeomorphism between manifolds. SFM effectively leverages the intrinsic geometric properties by following the shortest paths of geodesics between the noise and target distributions on the statistical manifold.   (2) Our distinctive geometric perspective of the statistical manifold allows us to further apply optimal transport during training and derive tractable exact likelihood for any given sample of probability measure, both of which are unachievable for most existing methods. We also introduce new theoretical insights by establishing connections among Riemannian flow matching, information geometry, and natural gradient descent, which allows us to interpret SFM as following the steepest descent of the natural gradient from the optimization angle.   (3) We demonstrated with a toy example on simplex that SFM can learn more complex patterns on the statistical manifold where existing models often fail due to impromptu prior assumptions. We further conducted extensive experiments on diverse real-world discrete generation tasks involving computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. SFM consistently outperformed existing diffusion or flow-based models and also achieved comparable results with autoregressive models on character-level generation.     2 Preliminary   2.1 Information Geometry  In this work, we are interested in learning a parameterized family of probability measures.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained popularity for customizing AI systems (Christiano et\u00a0al., 2017; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2023). RLHF involves learning a reward function from human preference data, then using a reinforcement learning algorithm to train a policy to optimize the learned reward model.   A key challenge in RLHF lies in the complexity of reward modeling, which primarily stems from the reliance on preference labels. Since preference labels only provide comparative rankings of trajectory segments without quantifying the scale of underlying preference strengths, previous methods have employed the Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley & Terry, 1952) in conjunction with cross-entropy loss to learn the reward function from preference data (Christiano et\u00a0al., 2017; Stiennon et\u00a0al., 2020). This approach assumes that the logit of the preference distribution scales linearly with the reward difference across all sample pairs. However, such linear scaling is often insufficient to account for the variations in preference strength among different pairs, restricting the reward function\u2019s ability to capture a broader range of reward differences. This restrictive approach to reward modeling limits the flexibility of the learned reward function, hindering its capacity to produce the versatile rewards essential for the downstream policy optimization.   To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a novel adaptive preference loss function inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO, Duchi et\u00a0al. (2021)). Our approach incorporates an instance-specific scaling factor to change the scaling between the preference distribution and the reward difference to be non-linear. These factors are learned during training and enable the model to accommodate varying uncertainties of preference strength, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the reward. For pairs showing strong preference (i.e., low preference uncertainty), our method learns a large scaling factor, which enables the model to learn a larger reward difference. In contrast, for pairs showing ambiguous preferences (i.e., high preference uncertainty), our method assigns a smaller scaling factor, enabling the model to learn a smaller reward difference. The additional computational overhead of involving this scaling factor into training is negligible, as the proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter. Therefore, it can be easily optimized by a simple second-order algorithm within a few iterations.   Our experiments on robotic control tasks (Todorov et\u00a0al., 2012) demonstrate that our method can learn a more flexible reward function, resulting in an improved policy. Surprisingly, we also discover that our method better aligns the learned reward function with downstream policy optimization. Specifically, when tuning hyperparameters for reward modeling, the simplest approach is to select the reward model according to preference prediction accuracy. However, the selected reward function (with the highest accuracy) often yields a downstream policy with poor performance. To address this misalignment, we usually have to jointly tune the parameters across both stages according to downstream policy performance, resulting in significant computational burden and tuning effort.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained popularity for customizing AI systems (Christiano et\u00a0al., 2017; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2023). RLHF involves learning a reward function from human preference data, then using a reinforcement learning algorithm to train a policy to optimize the learned reward model.   A key challenge in RLHF lies in the complexity of reward modeling, which primarily stems from the reliance on preference labels. Since preference labels only provide comparative rankings of trajectory segments without quantifying the scale of underlying preference strengths, previous methods have employed the Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley & Terry, 1952) in conjunction with cross-entropy loss to learn the reward function from preference data (Christiano et\u00a0al., 2017; Stiennon et\u00a0al., 2020). This approach assumes that the logit of the preference distribution scales linearly with the reward difference across all sample pairs. However, such linear scaling is often insufficient to account for the variations in preference strength among different pairs, restricting the reward function\u2019s ability to capture a broader range of reward differences. This restrictive approach to reward modeling limits the flexibility of the learned reward function, hindering its capacity to produce the versatile rewards essential for the downstream policy optimization.   To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a novel adaptive preference loss function inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO, Duchi et\u00a0al. (2021)). Our approach incorporates an instance-specific scaling factor to change the scaling between the preference distribution and the reward difference to be non-linear. These factors are learned during training and enable the model to accommodate varying uncertainties of preference strength, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the reward. For pairs showing strong preference (i.e., low preference uncertainty), our method learns a large scaling factor, which enables the model to learn a larger reward difference. In contrast, for pairs showing ambiguous preferences (i.e., high preference uncertainty), our method assigns a smaller scaling factor, enabling the model to learn a smaller reward difference. The additional computational overhead of involving this scaling factor into training is negligible, as the proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter. Therefore, it can be easily optimized by a simple second-order algorithm within a few iterations.   Our experiments on robotic control tasks (Todorov et\u00a0al., 2012) demonstrate that our method can learn a more flexible reward function, resulting in an improved policy. Surprisingly, we also discover that our method better aligns the learned reward function with downstream policy optimization. Specifically, when tuning hyperparameters for reward modeling, the simplest approach is to select the reward model according to preference prediction accuracy. However, the selected reward function (with the highest accuracy) often yields a downstream policy with poor performance. To address this misalignment, we usually have to jointly tune the parameters across both stages according to downstream policy performance, resulting in significant computational burden and tuning effort.

It can advance the field by improving the adaptability and performance of AI systems, leading to better outcomes in various applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of reward modeling, particularly in capturing a broader range of reward differences based on preference strengths. Naive approaches relying on linear scaling may not adequately account for variations in preference strength, hindering the flexibility of the reward function. Overcoming this requires addressing uncertainties in preference strength and optimizing the scaling factor during training.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious methods have primarily used linear scaling based on preference labels, limiting the reward function's flexibility and hindering downstream policy optimization. The lack of a non-linear scaling approach to accommodate varying preference uncertainties has prevented the problem from being fully addressed. The proposed adaptive preference loss function offers a novel solution to this limitation, improving reward flexibility and alignment with policy optimization.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves incorporating instance-specific scaling factors to adjust the scaling between preference distribution and reward difference non-linearly. These factors are learned during training to accommodate varying uncertainties in preference strength, enhancing the reward function's flexibility. The expected outcome is a more flexible reward function that improves downstream policy optimization, as demonstrated in experiments on robotic control tasks.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 960755f5-c8ec-4e7f-b7ae-8be73c7288e5 \nFrom agent2 to agent3: Hello, I am agent2.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Many application domains involve point process data, which records the times or locations of events occurring within a region. Point process models are used to analyze these event data, aiming to uncover patterns of event occurrences. The Poisson process\u00a0[15], as an important model in the field of point processes, plays a significant role in neuroscience\u00a0[4], finance\u00a0[11], criminology\u00a0[31], epidemiology\u00a0[5], and seismology\u00a0[8]. Traditional Poisson processes assume parameterized intensity functions, which severely restricts the flexibility of the model. To address this issue, a viable solution is to employ Bayesian nonparametric methods, by imposing a nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) prior on the intensity function, resulting in the Gaussian Cox process\u00a0[3]. This greatly enhances the flexibility of the model, while also endowing it with uncertainty quantification capabilities.   In Gaussian Cox processes, posterior inference of the intensity is challenging because the GP prior is not conjugate to the Poisson process likelihood that includes an intensity integral. Furthermore, to ensure the non-negativity of the intensity, we need to use a link function to transform the GP prior. Commonly used link functions include exponential\u00a0[20; 12], sigmoid\u00a0[1; 9; 6], square\u00a0[18; 7; 29], ReLU\u00a0[16], and softplus\u00a0[24]. Among these, using the square link function, i.e., the permanental process\u00a0[19], allows for the analytical computation of the intensity integral\u00a0[18; 33; 29], thus receiving widespread attention in recent years. For this reason, this work focuses on the permanental process.   Currently, the permanental process faces three issues: (1) The permanental process inherits the notorious cubic computational complexity of GPs, making it impractical for use with a large amount of data\u00a0[18; 14]. (2) Existing works on permanental processes either require certain standard types of kernels, such as the squared exponential kernel, etc., to ensure that the intensity integral has an analytical solution [18; 7; 33]; or they require the kernels to be stationary [14; 29]. These constraints limit the expressive power of the model. (3) Furthermore, existing works have predominantly utilized simple shallow kernels, which restricts the flexibility of the model. Although some shallow kernels [34; 28] are flexible and theoretically capable of approximating any bounded kernel, they are limited in representing complex kernels due to computational constraints in practical usage.   In this study, we utilize the sparse spectral representation of nonstationary kernels to address these limitations in modeling the permanental process. The sparse spectral representation provides a low-rank approximation of the kernel, effectively reducing the computational complexity from cubic to linear level. The nonstationary sparse spectral kernel overcomes the limitation of stationary assumption. By treating the frequencies as kernel parameters for optimization, we can directly learn the nonstationary kernel from the data in a flexible manner without restricting the kernel\u2019s form. We further extend the shallow nonstationary sparse spectral kernel by hierarchically stacking multiple spectral feature mappings to construct a deep kernel, which exhibits significantly enhanced expressive power compared to shallow ones. We term the constructed model as Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process (NSSPP) and the corresponding deep kernel variant as DNSSPP.   We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that when the data is (approximately) stationary, (D)NSSPP achieves similar performance to stationary baselines.

Point process models are used to analyze these event data, aiming to uncover patterns of event occurrences. The Poisson process\u00a0[15], as an important model in the field of point processes, plays a significant role in neuroscience\u00a0[4], finance\u00a0[11], criminology\u00a0[31], epidemiology\u00a0[5], and seismology\u00a0[8]. Traditional Poisson processes assume parameterized intensity functions, which severely restricts the flexibility of the model. To address this issue, a viable solution is to employ Bayesian nonparametric methods, by imposing a nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) prior on the intensity function, resulting in the Gaussian Cox process\u00a0[3]. This greatly enhances the flexibility of the model, while also endowing it with uncertainty quantification capabilities.   In Gaussian Cox processes, posterior inference of the intensity is challenging because the GP prior is not conjugate to the Poisson process likelihood that includes an intensity integral. Furthermore, to ensure the non-negativity of the intensity, we need to use a link function to transform the GP prior. Commonly used link functions include exponential\u00a0[20; 12], sigmoid\u00a0[1; 9; 6], square\u00a0[18; 7; 29], ReLU\u00a0[16], and softplus\u00a0[24]. Among these, using the square link function, i.e., the permanental process\u00a0[19], allows for the analytical computation of the intensity integral\u00a0[18; 33; 29], thus receiving widespread attention in recent years. For this reason, this work focuses on the permanental process.   Currently, the permanental process faces three issues: (1) The permanental process inherits the notorious cubic computational complexity of GPs, making it impractical for use with a large amount of data\u00a0[18; 14]. (2) Existing works on permanental processes either require certain standard types of kernels, such as the squared exponential kernel, etc., to ensure that the intensity integral has an analytical solution [18; 7; 33]; or they require the kernels to be stationary [14; 29]. These constraints limit the expressive power of the model. (3) Furthermore, existing works have predominantly utilized simple shallow kernels, which restricts the flexibility of the model. Although some shallow kernels [34; 28] are flexible and theoretically capable of approximating any bounded kernel, they are limited in representing complex kernels due to computational constraints in practical usage.   In this study, we utilize the sparse spectral representation of nonstationary kernels to address these limitations in modeling the permanental process. The sparse spectral representation provides a low-rank approximation of the kernel, effectively reducing the computational complexity from cubic to linear level. The nonstationary sparse spectral kernel overcomes the limitation of stationary assumption. By treating the frequencies as kernel parameters for optimization, we can directly learn the nonstationary kernel from the data in a flexible manner without restricting the kernel\u2019s form. We further extend the shallow nonstationary sparse spectral kernel by hierarchically stacking multiple spectral feature mappings to construct a deep kernel, which exhibits significantly enhanced expressive power compared to shallow ones. We term the constructed model as Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process (NSSPP) and the corresponding deep kernel variant as DNSSPP.   We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that when the data is (approximately) stationary, (D)NSSPP achieves similar performance to stationary baselines.

Thus, in this paper, we restrict ourselves to only training the implicit layer. We show that global convergence is guaranteed, even if only the implicit layer is trained.

It is worth noting that, unlike existing works on the convergence of (S)GD on finite-layer over-parameterized neural networks, our convergence results hold for implicit neural networks, where the number of layers is \\\\textit{infinite}.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05645v2\", \"timestamp\": 1633994570, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"4e1d85c6-956c-490c-ad9a-85eedbab81d2\", \"authors\": [\"Daniel T.

However, as they train all layers together, their analyses are equivalent to only studying the evolution of the output layer. It is unclear how the implicit layer contributes to the training. Thus, in this paper, we restrict ourselves to only training the implicit layer. We show that global convergence is guaranteed, even if only the implicit layer is trained. On the other hand, the theoretical understanding of when and how the training performance of an implicit neural network can be generalized to unseen data is still under-explored. Although this problem has been studied in standard feed-forward networks, the case of implicit neural networks is still intriguing since implicit networks theoretically have infinitely many layers. Therefore, this paper investigates the generalization error for implicit neural networks. Specifically, we study the generalization of an implicit network activated by the ReLU function over random initialization. We provide a generalization bound that is initialization sensitive.

It can lead to advancements in understanding event occurrences and patterns, thus contributing to the research community's knowledge and practical applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges include the cubic computational complexity of Gaussian processes, constraints on kernel types, and limitations in representing complex kernels. Naive approaches may fail due to the need for nonstationary kernels and the computational constraints in practical usage. Overcoming these obstacles requires innovative solutions and methodologies.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has been limited by the computational complexity of Gaussian processes, constraints on kernel types, and the use of simple shallow kernels. These factors have hindered the development of a comprehensive solution to the limitations of the permanental process. Our approach aims to address these gaps by introducing a nonstationary sparse spectral representation to reduce computational complexity and enhance model flexibility.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves utilizing the nonstationary sparse spectral representation to construct a Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process (NSSPP) and a deep kernel variant (DNSSPP).

However, despite their impressive zero-shot performance, LLMs still need to align to a given user and task (Mysore et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). In many applications, a natural feedback for LLM-based agents is user edits, where a user queries the agent and edits the agent\u2019s response before their own final use. In contrast, typical feedback used for fine-tuning, such as the comparison-based preference feedback in RLHF, is explicitly collected by providing annotators with model responses and asking them to rank (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022a, inter alia), making such feedback an expensive choice for improving alignment. Motivated by this observation, we focus on interactive learning of LLM-based language agents using user edits as feedback. \u2217Equal contribution. 1Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/gao-g/prelude .

However, despite their impressive zero-shot performance, LLMs still need to align to a given user and task (Mysore et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). In many applications, a natural feedback for LLM-based agents is user edits, where a user queries the agent and edits the agent\u2019s response before their own final use. In contrast, typical feedback used for fine-tuning, such as the comparison-based preference feedback in RLHF, is explicitly collected by providing annotators with model responses and asking them to rank (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022a, inter alia), making such feedback an expensive choice for improving alignment. Motivated by this observation, we focus on interactive learning of LLM-based language agents using user edits as feedback. \u2217Equal contribution. 1Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/gao-g/prelude .

Their complex geometric structure enables specific inter-molecular interactions that allow for crucial functions within organisms, such as acting as catalysts in chemical reactions, transporters for molecules, and providing immune responses. Normally, such functions arise as a result of evolution. With the emergence of computational techniques, it has become possible to rationally design novel proteins with desired structures that program their functions. Such methods are now seen as the future of drug design and can lead to solutions to long-standing global health challenges. Some recent examples include rationally designed protein binders for receptors related to influenza\u00a0(Strauch et\u00a0al., 2017), COVID-19\u00a0(Cao et\u00a0al., 2020a; Gainza et\u00a0al., 2023), and cancer\u00a0(Silva et\u00a0al., 2019).

In protein engineering, the term de novo design refers to a setting when a new protein is designed to satisfy pre-specified structural and functional properties\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2016). Chemically, a protein is a sequence of amino acids (residues) linked into a chain that folds into a complex 3D structure under the influence of electrostatic forces. The protein backbone can be seen as N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N rigid bodies (corresponding to N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N residues) that contain four heavy atoms N\u2212C\u03b1\u2212C\u2212ONsubscriptC\ud835\udefcCO\\text{N}-\\text{C}_{\\alpha}-\\text{C}-\\text{O}N - C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_\u03b1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - C - O. Mathematically, each residue can be associated with a frame that adheres to the symmetries of orientation-preserving rigid transformations (3D rotations and translations), forming the special Euclidean group SE\u2062(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE(3)}roman_SE ( 3 )\u00a0(Jumper et\u00a0al., 2021); the entire protein backbone is described by the group product SE\u2062(3)NSEsuperscript3\ud835\udc41\\mathrm{SE(3)}^{\\scriptscriptstyle N}roman_SE ( 3 ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. The problem of protein design can be formulated as sampling from the distribution over this group, which is a perspective used in our paper. Recently, generative models have been generalized to Riemannian manifolds\u00a0(Mathieu & Nickel, 2020; De\u00a0Bortoli et\u00a0al., 2022). However, they are not purpose-built to exploit the rich geometric structure of SE\u2062(3)NSEsuperscript3\ud835\udc41\\mathrm{SE(3)}^{\\scriptscriptstyle N}roman_SE ( 3 ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. Furthermore, several approaches require numerically expensive steps like simulating a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) during training or using the Riemannian divergence in the objective\u00a0(Huang et\u00a0al., 2022; Leach et\u00a0al., 2022; Ben-Hamu et\u00a0al., 2022).   Our approach. We introduce FoldFlow, a family of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) tailored for distributions on SE\u2062(3)NSEsuperscript3\ud835\udc41\\mathrm{SE(3)}^{\\scriptscriptstyle N}roman_SE ( 3 ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (fig.\u00a01). We use the framework of Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a simulation-free approach to learning CNFs by directly regressing time-dependent vector fields that generate probability paths \u00a0(Lipman et\u00a0al., 2022; Tong et\u00a0al., 2023b). In particular, we introduce three new CFM-based models that learn SE\u2062(3)NSEsuperscript3\ud835\udc41\\mathrm{SE(3)}^{\\scriptscriptstyle N}roman_SE ( 3 ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-invariant distributions to generate protein backbones. In contrast to the previous SE\u2062(3)SE3\\mathrm{SE(3)}roman_SE ( 3 ) diffusion approach of Yim et\u00a0al.

Their complex geometric structure enables specific inter-molecular interactions that allow for crucial functions within organisms, such as acting as catalysts in chemical reactions, transporters for molecules, and providing immune responses. Normally, such functions arise as a result of evolution. With the emergence of computational techniques, it has become possible to rationally design novel proteins with desired structures that program their functions. Such methods are now seen as the future of drug design and can lead to solutions to long-standing global health challenges. Some recent examples include rationally designed protein binders for receptors related to influenza\u00a0(Strauch et\u00a0al., 2017), COVID-19\u00a0(Cao et\u00a0al., 2020a; Gainza et\u00a0al., 2023), and cancer\u00a0(Silva et\u00a0al., 2019).

Their complex geometric structure enables specific inter-molecular interactions that allow for crucial functions within organisms, such as acting as catalysts in chemical reactions, transporters for molecules, and providing immune responses. Normally, such functions arise as a result of evolution. With the emergence of computational techniques, it has become possible to rationally design novel proteins with desired structures that program their functions. Such methods are now seen as the future of drug design and can lead to solutions to long-standing global health challenges. Some recent examples include rationally designed protein binders for receptors related to influenza\u00a0(Strauch et\u00a0al., 2017), COVID-19\u00a0(Cao et\u00a0al., 2020a; Gainza et\u00a0al., 2023), and cancer\u00a0(Silva et\u00a0al., 2019).

Despite its potential, PRS faces barriers to adoption, such as data inclusivity, psychological impact, and public trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore how people perceive PRS, formed of surveys (n=254) and interviews (n=11) with UK-based participants. The interviews were supplemented by interactive storyboards with the ContraVision technique to provoke deeper reflection and discussion. We identified ten key barriers and five themes to PRS adoption and proposed design implications for a responsible PRS framework.

An extension of the problem to the heterogeneous setting (dubbed k-synchronization) is to estimate kgroups of angles simultaneously, given noisy observations (with unknown group assignment) from each group. Existingmethods fall behind the trivial baseline.

We observe that even when applying these fine-tuning steps, the baselines are usually beaten by our end-to-end trainable GNNSync pipeline. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylegamma (a) ERO 1pp\u201c0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal1 (b) ERO 2pp\u201c0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp5N360stylemulti normal0 (c) ERO 3pp\u201c0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp5N360styleblock normal6 (d) ERO 4pp\u201c0.05q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylegamma (e) ERO 1pp\u201c0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal1 (f) ERO 2pp\u201c0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360stylemulti normal0 (g) ERO 3pp\u201c0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp10N360styleblock normal6 (h) ERO 4pp\u201c0.1q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.53.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylegamma (i) ERO 1pp\u201c0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal1 (j) ERO 2pp\u201c0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.02.5MSE k1EROp15N360stylemulti normal0 (k) ERO 3pp\u201c0.15q 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 \u03b70.00.51.01.52.0MSE k1EROp15N360styleblock normal6 (l) ERO 4pp\u201c0.15q Figure 28: MSE performance comparison on GNNSync variants on angular synchronization ( k\u201c1) for ERO models. pis the network density and \u03b7is the noise level.

The second scheme eliminates the dependence on angular velocities by introducing dynamic auxiliary variables, while ensuring global asymptotic attitude synchronization.

This approach offers a theoretically-grounded, end-to-end trainable framework that outperforms existing methods, even in challenging scenarios with high noise levels. Addressing this problem can advance knowledge in neural network applications for synchronization tasks and lead to more robust and accurate solutions in real-world applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe angular synchronization problem becomes challenging in high-noise regimes, where existing methods often underperform. The complexities lie in accurately estimating unknown angles from noisy measurements and handling the heterogeneous setting with multiple groups of angles. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate relationships between angles, noisy observations, and the need for robust synchronization in adverse conditions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has shown limitations in existing methods for angular synchronization, especially in high-noise environments. The lack of robustness and accuracy in traditional approaches has hindered the effective estimation of angles and group assignments. The proposed GNNSync framework offers a novel solution that leverages directed graph neural networks and new loss functions to achieve superior performance, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves using directed graph neural networks in the GNNSync framework to estimate angles and group assignments robustly. The dataset used for testing includes noisy observations and varying noise levels to evaluate performance. The key metrics for evaluation include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Error Rate (ER).

In this paper, we leverage neural networks for the angular synchronization problem, and its heterogeneous extension, by proposing GNNSync, a theoretically-grounded end-to-end trainable framework using directed graph neural networks. In addition, new loss functions are devised to encode synchronization objectives. Experimental results on extensive data sets demonstrate that GNNSync attains competitive, and often superior, performance against a comprehensive set of baselines for the angular synchronization problem and its extension, validating the robustness of GNNSync even at high noise levels.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05842v2\", \"timestamp\": 1696869439, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"921a701e-ec29-4db0-a7e8-51b59987a86e\", \"authors\": [\"Mouaad Boughellaba\", \"Soulaimane Berkane\", \"Abdelhamid Tayebi\"], \"title\": \"Global Attitude Synchronization for Multi-agent Systems on SO(3)\", \"abstract\": \"In this paper, we address the problem of attitude synchronization for a group of rigid body systems evolving on SO(3). The interaction among these systems is modeled through an undirected, connected, and acyclic graph topology. First, we present an almost global continuous distributed attitude synchronization scheme with rigorously proven stability guarantees. Thereafter, we propose two global distributed hybrid attitude synchronization schemes on SO(3). The first scheme is a hybrid control law that leverages angular velocities and relative orientations to achieve global alignment to a common orientation. The second scheme eliminates the dependence on angular velocities by introducing dynamic auxiliary variables, while ensuring global asymptotic attitude synchronization. This velocity-free control scheme relies exclusively on attitude information. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed attitude synchronization schemes.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11188v1\", \"timestamp\": 1737324738, \"domain\": \"eess.SY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7174efad-8cba-4ef2-8261-9cf121bce646\", \"authors\": [\"Vishaal Krishnan\", \"Arun D.

We show that such a network synchronizes provided the underlying graph is connected and certain conditions on the coupling gains are satisfied. In the analysis, we consider as states the phase and angular frequency differences between the oscillators, and the resulting dynamics possesses a continuum of equilibria.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Tensor decomposition methods have recently found numerous applications in machine learning. Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing\u00a0[Zhou et\u00a0al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et\u00a0al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning\u00a0[Novikov et\u00a0al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction\u00a0[Bengua et\u00a0al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes\u00a0[Izmailov et\u00a0al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC\u00a0(CP) and Tucker decompositions\u00a0[Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R\ud835\udc45Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem\u00a0[Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train\u00a0(TT) decomposition\u00a0[Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm\u00a0[Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square\u00a0(ALS) is another popular approach\u00a0[Holtz et\u00a0al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition\u00a0(SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart\u00a0[Halko et\u00a0al., 2011, Huber et\u00a0al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26\u00d7\\times\u00d7 speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.   Our core contribution is the following theorem, which shows that we can efficiently compute a\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Their ability to perform operations efficiently on very high-dimensional tensors makes them suitable for data science and machine learning problems. For example, they have been used for neuro-imaging, and signal processing\u00a0[Zhou et\u00a0al., 2013, Sidiropoulos et\u00a0al., 2017, Cichocki and Phan, 2009], supervised learning\u00a0[Novikov et\u00a0al., 2016, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016], feature extraction\u00a0[Bengua et\u00a0al., 2015] and scaling up Gaussian processes\u00a0[Izmailov et\u00a0al., 2018]. The two most popular decompositions are the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC\u00a0(CP) and Tucker decompositions\u00a0[Hitchcock, 1927, Tucker, 1966]. However, the number of parameters in the Tucker decomposition grows exponentially with the order of a tensor and finding a rank-R\ud835\udc45Ritalic_R CP decomposition is an NP-hard problem\u00a0[Kolda and Bader, 2009, Hillar and Lim, 2013]. To address these issues, the Tensor Train\u00a0(TT) decomposition\u00a0[Oseledets, 2011] can be used to represent a tensor in a compressed format where the number of parameters scales linearly with the order of a tensor. Also, there are stable algorithms to compute the TT decomposition.   Due to the high-dimensional nature of tensors, designing efficient algorithms for computing the TT decomposition is crucial. A popular method for computing the TT decomposition of an N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N-dimensional tensor \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X is the TT-SVD algorithm\u00a0[Oseledets, 2011] which uses a sequence of singular values decompositions on the tensor unfoldings to produce the TT representation in a single pass. Since TT-SVD requires performing SVDs of unfoldings of \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X, its cost is exponential in N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N. Alternating Least Square\u00a0(ALS) is another popular approach\u00a0[Holtz et\u00a0al., 2012] to find the TT approximation. Starting with a crude guess, each iteration of ALS involves solving a sequence of least squares problems. While ALS is the workhorse algorithm in many tensor decomposition problems, the computational cost is still exponential in N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N, since each iteration requires solving least squares problems involving unfoldings of \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic_X. These issues have led to the search for alternatives based on randomization and sampling techniques. A cheaper alternative to the TT-SVD with strong accuracy guarantees can be implemented by replacing the exact singular value decomposition\u00a0(SVD) with a well-studied randomized counterpart\u00a0[Halko et\u00a0al., 2011, Huber et\u00a0al., 2017]. Randomized variants of the TT-ALS approach have received little attention. In this work, we propose a novel randomized variant of the TT-ALS algorithm relying on exact leverage score sampling.   Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based ALS approach to compute the TT decomposition: rTT-ALS. By using exact leverage score sampling, we are able to significantly reduce the size of each ALS least squares problem while providing strong guarantees on the approximation error. At the core of rTT-ALS, we leverage the TT canonical form to efficiently compute the exact leverage scores and speed up the solutions of least square problems in each iteration of ALS. To the best of our knowledge, rTT-ALS is the first efficient TT decomposition by the ALS algorithm which relies on leverage scores sampling. We provide experiments on synthetic and real massive sparse and dense tensors showing that rTT-ALS can achieve up to 26\u00d7\\times\u00d7 speed-up compared to its non-randomized counterpart with little to no loss in accuracy.

The recent decade has witnessed the wide applications of TT-format tensors from diverse disciplines, among which tensor completion has drawn considerable attention. Numerous fast algorithms, including the Riemannian gradient descent (RGrad), have been proposed for the TT-format tensor completion. However, the theoretical guarantees of these algorithms are largely missing or sub-optimal, partly due to the complicated and recursive algebraic operations in TT-format decomposition. Moreover, existing results established for the tensors of other formats, for example, Tucker and CP, are inapplicable because the algorithms treating TT-format tensors are substantially different and more involved. In this paper, we provide, to our best knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees of the convergence of RGrad algorithm for TT-format tensor completion, under a nearly optimal sample size condition. The RGrad algorithm converges linearly with a constant contraction rate that is free of tensor condition number without the necessity of re-conditioning. We also propose a novel approach, referred to as the sequential second-order moment method, to attain a warm initialization under a similar sample size requirement. As a byproduct, our result even significantly refines the prior investigation of RGrad algorithm for matrix completion. Lastly, statistically (near) optimal rate is derived for RGrad algorithm if the observed entries consist of random sub-Gaussian noise.

The common tasks include the following:   1.  Removing Harmful Responses: Since LLMs are trained on the Internet data which contain countless harmful text, they are easy to learn problematic responses. For example, (Zhuo et\u00a0al., 2023; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023) have shown that LLMs can memorize harmful concepts; such responses can cause great harm to users.    2.  Erasing Copyrighted Contents: The tension between data owners (e.g., authors) and LLM service providers is escalating, leading to legislation such as legal disputes involving OpenAI, Meta, and New York Times (Small, 2023; Grynbaum and Mac, 2023; Copilot, 2023). We have also seen a large number of recent works that show LLMs can memorize and leak copyright-protected information\u00a0(Carlini et\u00a0al., 2021; Wahle et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023). Removing such behaviors learned by the LLMs as requested by the authors is important but is prohibitively expensive if we need to retrain LLMs from scratch.    3.  Reducing Hallucinations: LLMs often give factually wrong responses that mislead users. Reducing hallucinations, especially in high-stakes applications, is the key to earning user trust.    4.  Protecting User Privacy: Users might stop giving consent to the LLM service providers for using their data. When it happens, LLM practitioners need a way of removing the old user data from the trained LLMs.    5.  Enforcing Policy Compliance: Local community compliance policy can iterate frequently (TikTok, 2023; Twitter, 2023; Facebook, 2023). Practitioners need techniques to quickly remove historical training data that leads to outputs that are no longer policy-compliant.      Though those tasks seem different, the central technical question is identical: How to quickly remove the impact of training samples on LLMs? To this end, we study how to perform large language model unlearning. If an LLM learns unwanted misbehaviors in its pretraining stage, our goal is to unlearn them with samples that represent those problematic behaviors, i.e. with only negative samples.   Figure 1: Harmful content warning. Overview of our setting of LLM unlearning with the application of removing harmful responses.   We summarize the benefits of LLM unlearning. (1) It only requires negative examples that we want the LLM to forget, which are cheaper and easier to collect through user reporting or red teaming than positive examples, which are required in the standard RLHF. In addition, discovering negative examples is highly automatable given the pretrained (i.e. unaligned) LLM. (2) It is computationally efficient; the cost is similar to finetuning LLMs. (3) Unlearning is particularly effective in removing unwanted behaviors if practitioners already know which training samples cause them. Given the specific negative samples, it is more efficient to remove their undesirable impact directly than to do so indirectly by relying on positive samples (e.g. in RLHF) \u2013 if the goal is to stop generating undesirable outputs, e.g. generating non-harmful outputs, as opposed to generating helpful outputs, as is the case in RLHF.

Removing such behaviors learned by the LLMs as requested by the authors is important but is prohibitively expensive if we need to retrain LLMs from scratch.    3.  Reducing Hallucinations: LLMs often give factually wrong responses that mislead users. Reducing hallucinations, especially in high-stakes applications, is the key to earning user trust.    4.  Protecting User Privacy: Users might stop giving consent to the LLM service providers for using their data. When it happens, LLM practitioners need a way of removing the old user data from the trained LLMs.    5.  Enforcing Policy Compliance: Local community compliance policy can iterate frequently (TikTok, 2023; Twitter, 2023; Facebook, 2023). Practitioners need techniques to quickly remove historical training data that leads to outputs that are no longer policy-compliant.      Though those tasks seem different, the central technical question is identical: How to quickly remove the impact of training samples on LLMs? To this end, we study how to perform large language model unlearning. If an LLM learns unwanted misbehaviors in its pretraining stage, our goal is to unlearn them with samples that represent those problematic behaviors, i.e. with only negative samples.

(1) It only requires negative examples that we want the LLM to forget, which are cheaper and easier to collect through user reporting or red teaming than positive examples, which are required in the standard RLHF. In addition, discovering negative examples is highly automatable given the pretrained (i.e. unaligned) LLM. (2) It is computationally efficient; the cost is similar to finetuning LLMs. (3) Unlearning is particularly effective in removing unwanted behaviors if practitioners already know which training samples cause them.

The common tasks include the following:   1.  Removing Harmful Responses: Since LLMs are trained on the Internet data which contain countless harmful text, they are easy to learn problematic responses. For example, (Zhuo et\u00a0al., 2023; Bai et\u00a0al., 2022; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023) have shown that LLMs can memorize harmful concepts; such responses can cause great harm to users.    2.

Recent works have improved SAEs using language model gradients, but these techniques require many expensive backward passes during training and still cause a significant increase in cross entropy loss when SAE reconstructions are inserted into the model. In this work, we improve on these limitations by taking a fundamentally different approach: we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the language model itself around a previously trained SAE. We analyze our method across SAE sparsity, SAE width, language model size, LoRA rank, and model layer on the Gemma Scope family of SAEs. In these settings, our method reduces the cross entropy loss gap by 30% to 55% when SAEs are inserted during the forward pass.

Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk.

This is because the ground truth labels remain potential candidates within the scope of uncertainty quantification, leaving gaps in the evaluation of true forgetting. In this paper, we identify critical limitations in existing unlearning metrics and propose enhanced evaluation metrics inspired by conformal prediction. Our metrics can effectively capture the extent to which ground truth labels are excluded from the prediction set. Furthermore, we observe that many existing machine unlearning methods do not achieve satisfactory forgetting performance when evaluated with our new metrics. To address this, we propose an unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction insights into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss.

We start with linear k-means and IMM on all three, and then run kernel k-means with both the Laplace as well as the Gaussian kernel over a range of hyperparameters \u03b3, choosing the best agreement with the ground truth as our starting point for Kernel IMM. When the Gaussian kernel is chosen, we run Kernel IMM both on the surrogate Taylor features from Definition 3 with M= 5, as well as on the surrogate features based on the kernel matrix, as defined in Equation (4), and choose the better one. We then refine the partition induced by Kernel IMM using both Kernel ExKMC as well as Kernel Expand, constructing m= 6,m= 10 andm= 4 leaves respectively. Note that at every step, Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand only need to check the cost of the threshold cuts at the new nodes (obtained from the previous iteration). Thus, adding mleaves to an existing tree with pleaves amounts to p+ 2miterations over all possible threshold cuts. We follow the same procedure for the two real world datasets. In Iris(Fisher, 1936), there are three classes with 50observations each. Every class refers to a type of iris plant. As illustrated in the barplot included in Section 6, kernel k-means slightly improves over k-means and this translates to Kernel IMM, Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand. The Wisconsin breast cancer dataset consists of 569observations of benign and malignant cells. The 30-dimensional features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei observed in each image. Interestingly, IMM exactly replicates its suboptimal reference k-means clustering. Kernel k-means better identifies the ground truth, and Kernel IMM approximates it well (even achieving a slightly higher agreement with the ground truth). The same is true for Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand. Kernel IMM for the \u03c72kernel. The additive \u03c72kernel is evaluated on a toy dataset obtained from a mixture model of four discrete distributions, with values in four bins. Figure 6 shows a plot of the different distributions. For all four distribution, we draw 5instances of 100random samples, and compute the fraction of observations in each bin for every instance (thus n= 20 andd= 4). We repeat this procedure 100times. We find that the \u03c72kernel achieves a Rand index that is consistently higher than the one of k-means (see Figure 6).

To represent complex patterns in vision data, two primary categories of backbone networks, i.e., Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)\u00a0[49, 28, 30, 54, 38] and Vision Transformers (ViTs)\u00a0[13, 37, 58, 68], have been proposed and extensively utilized in a variety of visual tasks. Compared to CNNs, ViTs generally demonstrate superior learning capabilities on large-scale data due to the integration of the self-attention mechanism\u00a0[59, 13]. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention w.r.t. the number of tokens introduces substantial computational overhead in downstream tasks involving large spatial resolutions.   To tackle this challenge, considerable efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of attention computation\u00a0[55, 37, 12]. However, existing approaches either impose limitations on the size of the effective receptive field\u00a0[37] or experience evident performance degradation across diverse tasks\u00a0[31, 62]. This motivates us to develop a novel architecture for vision data, preserving the inherent advantages of the vanilla self-attention mechanism, i.e., global receptive fields and dynamic weighting parameters\u00a0[23].   Recently, Mamba\u00a0[17], a novel State Space Model (SSM)\u00a0[17, 44, 61] in the field natural language processing (NLP), has emerged as a highly promising approach for long sequence modeling with linear complexity. Drawing inspiration from this advancement, we introduce VMamba, a vision backbone integrating SSM-based blocks to facilitate efficient visual representation learning. However, the core algorithm of Mamba, i.e., the parallelized selective scan operation, is essentially designed for processing one-dimensional sequential data. This poses a challenge when attempting to adapt it for processing vision data, which inherently lacks a sequential arrangement of visual components. To address this issue, we propose 2D Selective Scan (SS2D), a four-way scanning mechanism tailored for spatial domain traversal. In contrast to the self-attention mechanism (Figure\u00a01 (a)), SS2D ensures that each image patch gains contextual knowledge exclusively through a compressed hidden state computed along the corresponding scanning path (Figure\u00a01 (b)), thereby reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear.   Figure 1: Comparison of correlation establishment between image patches via (a) self-attention and (b) the proposed 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D). Red boxes indicate the query image patch, with patch opacity representing the degree of information loss.    Upon the VSS blocks, we develop a family of VMamba architectures (i.e., VMamba-Tiny/Small/Base) and accelerate them through a series of architectural enhancements and implementation optimizations. Compared to benchmark vision models built on CNN (ConvNeXt\u00a0[38]), ViT (Swin\u00a0[37] and HiViT\u00a0[68]), and SSM (S4ND\u00a0[45] and Vim\u00a0[71]), VMamba consistently achieves superior image classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K\u00a0[9] across model scales.

To represent complex patterns in vision data, two primary categories of backbone networks, i.e., Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)\u00a0[49, 28, 30, 54, 38] and Vision Transformers (ViTs)\u00a0[13, 37, 58, 68], have been proposed and extensively utilized in a variety of visual tasks. Compared to CNNs, ViTs generally demonstrate superior learning capabilities on large-scale data due to the integration of the self-attention mechanism\u00a0[59, 13]. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention w.r.t. the number of tokens introduces substantial computational overhead in downstream tasks involving large spatial resolutions.   To tackle this challenge, considerable efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of attention computation\u00a0[55, 37, 12]. However, existing approaches either impose limitations on the size of the effective receptive field\u00a0[37] or experience evident performance degradation across diverse tasks\u00a0[31, 62]. This motivates us to develop a novel architecture for vision data, preserving the inherent advantages of the vanilla self-attention mechanism, i.e., global receptive fields and dynamic weighting parameters\u00a0[23].   Recently, Mamba\u00a0[17], a novel State Space Model (SSM)\u00a0[17, 44, 61] in the field natural language processing (NLP), has emerged as a highly promising approach for long sequence modeling with linear complexity. Drawing inspiration from this advancement, we introduce VMamba, a vision backbone integrating SSM-based blocks to facilitate efficient visual representation learning. However, the core algorithm of Mamba, i.e., the parallelized selective scan operation, is essentially designed for processing one-dimensional sequential data. This poses a challenge when attempting to adapt it for processing vision data, which inherently lacks a sequential arrangement of visual components. To address this issue, we propose 2D Selective Scan (SS2D), a four-way scanning mechanism tailored for spatial domain traversal.

To represent complex patterns in vision data, two primary categories of backbone networks, i.e., Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)\u00a0[49, 28, 30, 54, 38] and Vision Transformers (ViTs)\u00a0[13, 37, 58, 68], have been proposed and extensively utilized in a variety of visual tasks. Compared to CNNs, ViTs generally demonstrate superior learning capabilities on large-scale data due to the integration of the self-attention mechanism\u00a0[59, 13]. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention w.r.t. the number of tokens introduces substantial computational overhead in downstream tasks involving large spatial resolutions.   To tackle this challenge, considerable efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of attention computation\u00a0[55, 37, 12]. However, existing approaches either impose limitations on the size of the effective receptive field\u00a0[37] or experience evident performance degradation across diverse tasks\u00a0[31, 62]. This motivates us to develop a novel architecture for vision data, preserving the inherent advantages of the vanilla self-attention mechanism, i.e., global receptive fields and dynamic weighting parameters\u00a0[23].   Recently, Mamba\u00a0[17], a novel State Space Model (SSM)\u00a0[17, 44, 61] in the field natural language processing (NLP), has emerged as a highly promising approach for long sequence modeling with linear complexity. Drawing inspiration from this advancement, we introduce VMamba, a vision backbone integrating SSM-based blocks to facilitate efficient visual representation learning. However, the core algorithm of Mamba, i.e., the parallelized selective scan operation, is essentially designed for processing one-dimensional sequential data. This poses a challenge when attempting to adapt it for processing vision data, which inherently lacks a sequential arrangement of visual components. To address this issue, we propose 2D Selective Scan (SS2D), a four-way scanning mechanism tailored for spatial domain traversal. In contrast to the self-attention mechanism (Figure\u00a01 (a)), SS2D ensures that each image patch gains contextual knowledge exclusively through a compressed hidden state computed along the corresponding scanning path (Figure\u00a01 (b)), thereby reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear.   Figure 1: Comparison of correlation establishment between image patches via (a) self-attention and (b) the proposed 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D). Red boxes indicate the query image patch, with patch opacity representing the degree of information loss.    Upon the VSS blocks, we develop a family of VMamba architectures (i.e., VMamba-Tiny/Small/Base) and accelerate them through a series of architectural enhancements and implementation optimizations. Compared to benchmark vision models built on CNN (ConvNeXt\u00a0[38]), ViT (Swin\u00a0[37] and HiViT\u00a0[68]), and SSM (S4ND\u00a0[45] and Vim\u00a0[71]), VMamba consistently achieves superior image classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K\u00a0[9] across model scales. Specifically, VMamba-Base achieves a top-1 accuracy of 83.9%percent83.983.9\\%83.9 %, surpassing Swin by +0.4%percent0.4+0.4\\%+ 0.4 %, with a throughput exceeding that of Swin by a substantial margin over 40%percent4040\\%40 % (646646646646 vs. 458458458458).

A key element of PM, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), uses genetic data to predict an individual's disease risk. Despite its potential, PRS faces barriers to adoption, such as data inclusivity, psychological impact, and public trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore how people perceive PRS, formed of surveys (n=254) and interviews (n=11) with UK-based participants. The interviews were supplemented by interactive storyboards with the ContraVision technique to provoke deeper reflection and discussion. We identified ten key barriers and five themes to PRS adoption and proposed design implications for a responsible PRS framework.

Transformer-based language models rely on Softmax to compute attention scores, causing the attention distribution to flatten as the context size grows. This reduces the model's ability to prioritize key information effectively and potentially limits its length generalization. To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax), which replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax can be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures. Experimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only achieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve performance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an analysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus attention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although models that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length generalization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some of this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either during or after pretraining.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19399v1\", \"timestamp\": 1738349735, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"91d04da1-1526-4775-965b-5636b056b80c\", \"authors\": [\"Mustafa O.

A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game\", \"abstract\": \"Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities.

First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending \\\"Wait\\\" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1 exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1 with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24.

Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to \\\"optimally\\\" compress the information that cannot be predicted.

In the same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self- supervised techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified rewards or labels. Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has demonstrated how self-supervised RLmethods: (a)cold initialization as men- tioned in Sec. 3.2.

(c) using a 10\u00d7smaller learning rate for the last lay- ers of \u03d5(s, a)and\u03c8(g). Our newexperiments, we now study how increasing the representation dimen- sion affects the success rates. We ablate the dimension of contrastive representation in the set{16,128,512}, averaging success rates over 10 episodes of 3 random seeds. As shown in Fig. 29, representations of sizes 128 and 512 achieve considerably lower success rates, echo- ing prior work in finding that smaller represen- tations yield better performance in the offline setting (Eysenbach et al., 2022). Theseresults might also be explained by the increase of noise with a larger representation size, suggesting that the smaller representations effectively act as a sort of regularization and mitigate overfitting. 29Appendix Fig. 22). So, we are optimistic that these design decisions may provide helpful guidance on further scaling theseappendix contains additionalResults in Fig. 18 demonstrate that interpolation in the V AE representation space and the pixel space are not well-aligned with the ground truth time steps (better than random permutations), while contrastive representations achieves a lower error, suggesting that it might contain information that is uniquely well-suited for control and potentially leverage a goal-conditioned policy. F.7 A RMMATCHING To evaluate the performance of contrastive RL in tackling the arm matching problem, we collect a trajectory of contrastive RL trained on the offline dataset and comparing the Q value predicted by stable contrastive RL with a GC-IQL trained on top of V AE representations, assuming that pre-trained features might help mitigate the arm matching problem as well. We normalize both Qs by values of the minimum and the goal. As shown in Fig. 19, stable contrastive RL correctly learns a monotonic increasing Q throughout the rollout, while GC-IQL learns a V-shape Q relating higher values to a 23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 closer arm to the target position, ignoring the position of the green block ( t= 30 ).

In the same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self- supervised techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified rewards or labels.

We ablate the dimension of contrastive representation in the set{16,128,512}, averaging success rates over 10 episodes of 3 random seeds. As shown in Fig. 29, representations of sizes 128 and 512 achieve considerably lower success rates, echo- ing prior work in finding that smaller represen- tations yield better performance in the offline setting (Eysenbach et al., 2022). Theseresults might also be explained by the increase of noise with a larger representation size, suggesting that the smaller representations effectively act as a sort of regularization and mitigate overfitting. 29Appendix Fig. 22).

F.7 A RMMATCHING To evaluate the performance of contrastive RL in tackling the arm matching problem, we collect a trajectory of contrastive RL trained on the offline dataset and comparing the Q value predicted by stable contrastive RL with a GC-IQL trained on top of V AE representations, assuming that pre-trained features might help mitigate the arm matching problem as well. We normalize both Qs by values of the minimum and the goal.

In particular, the following aspects of the models are preferred: i)\u00a0The users can interact with the QA models in a conversational way, thus one can easily raise follow-up questions. ii)\u00a0The models are capable of integrating retrieved chunks of evidence in both open-domain or long document settings, where the provided context is much longer than the context window of LLM\u00a0(e.g., Anthropic, 2023a; Xu et\u00a0al., 2023b). iii)\u00a0The generalist models can answer any questions with respect to table, arithmetic calculation in zero-shot manner without dataset-specific fine-tuning, while matching the accuracies of fine-tuned models. To this end, we focus on building the state-of-the-art model with all these key capabilities that are essentially important for many real-world applications.   However, building such a model that can match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4\u00a0(OpenAI, 2023), is still a grand challenge for the research community. In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a family of open-sourced models that can outperform GPT-4 while utilizing relatively weak open-weights foundation model. We also open-source our training data, detailing techniques for synthetic data generation, along with alternative human annotation processes aimed at eliminating reliance on OpenAI GPT models for open research purpose.   Specifically, we make the following contributions:   1.  We propose a two-stage instruction tuning method and design a dataset curation recipe that can largely enhance LLM\u2019s capability of integrating user provided or retrieved context for conversational QA and RAG tasks. We demonstrate that the proposed instruction tuning method significantly outperforms strong alignment baselines or RLHF-based recipes\u00a0(e.g., Llama2-Chat, Llama3-Instruct) on RAG and various conversational QA tasks.    2.  For retrieval, we show that fine-tuning the single-turn QA retriever on human-annotated data or synthetic multi-turn QA dataset works as well as utilizing the state-of-the-art LLM-based query rewriting model, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo\u00a0(OpenAI, 2022). Our result also highlights the promising direction of utilizing synthetic data generation for training customized retriever.    3.  We introduce ChatRAG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with ten conversational QA datasets, including five datasets with long documents that need retrieval and three datasets with tabular data and arithmetic calculation. We apply ChatQA training recipe on different text foundation models, and show the superb generalization capability of the proposed methods. In terms of average score on ChatRAG Bench, our ChatQA-1.0-70B\u00a0(54.14) based on Llama2 can outperform GPT-4-0613\u00a0(53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09\u00a0(54.03) without utilizing any synthetic data from ChatGPT models. Notably, much smaller Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B can perform comparable with GPT-4 models, while Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B outperforms GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 by a margin.    4.  We study the \u201cunanswerable\u201d scenario, where the LLM needs to generate \u201ccannot answer\u201d to avoid hallucination. We show that incorporating a small amount of \u201cunanswerable\u201d samples significantly enhances model\u2019s capability to handle it. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo in this regard, while has a slight gap compared to GPT-4-0613\u00a0(around 3.5%).      We discuss related work in \u00a7\u00a02.

The expected outcome is a state-of-the-art model, ChatQA, that can outperform GPT-4 in conversational QA and RAG tasks. The key components include leveraging open-weights foundation models, utilizing synthetic data for training, and demonstrating superior performance on the ChatRAG Bench benchmark.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, 4], "token_usage": 85612, "agent_kpis": {"agent_1": 2, "agent_2": 2, "agent_3": 2, "agent_4": 2, "agent_5": 1, "agent1": 1, "agent2": 1, "agent5": 1}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 3}}
{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Recently there have been rapid advances in training language models (LMs) to generate code rather than natural language (NL), following the intuition that code may be more effective than NL for certain tasks, such as those requiring complex calculations, iteration, or data structure manipulation(Chen et\u00a0al., 2022; Gao et\u00a0al., 2023). Although successful, these works have mostly evaluated on tasks conducive to a programmatic paradigm, such as symbolic manipulation or algorithmic reasoning \u2013 where a clear compilable program can be envisioned. However, it is unclear how to apply this approach to \u201csofter\u201d reasoning tasks such as commonsense and social reasoning tasks, where algorithmic solutions are less obvious (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023a).   Figure 1: Example from the CoGEX dataset automatically converted from an Alpaca\u00a0(Taori et\u00a0al., 2023) instance via LLM prompting. We train the model to receive the instruction and input and generate the Python program and function call (as an intermediate), before outputting the final dictionary that contains the answer and any intermediate reasoning steps.     Our goal is to expand an LM\u2019s program synthesis skills to such softer reasoning tasks. Our approach leverages the insight that as well as synthesizing code, LMs can also emulate the execution of code, including emulating function calls defined only by name and documentation, but lacking full code implementation. Such pseudo-programs may include both well-defined reasoning steps such as math or algorithmic tasks, as well as function calls for less precise forms of reasoning, such as commonsense. This work explores whether such programs can be generated and pseudo-executed to solve soft reasoning tasks as well as traditional algorithmic tasks.   To achieve this, we propose a novel approach: training models to follow NL instructions by generating a program and then emulating that program\u2019s code execution. Our paradigm, called CoGEX, changes the inference process to (1) generate a Python function given an arbitrary instruction and optional input, (2) generate a call to that function, and (3) produce the result of simulating its execution. Unlike other work\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023b; Li et\u00a0al., 2023), we do not use a Python interpreter to execute any code; rather, the model is trained to emulate execution. This allows the generated code to deliberately include calls to underspecified functions (i.e., where only the function name and documentation are included), because the LM execution emulator is able to speculate on those functions\u2019 behaviors using its latent knowledge. We train the model to not only output the result of pseudo-executing the code but also the results of intermediate function calls in the code. This gives us an improved level of interpretability and systematicity. CoGEX thus suggests a way to leverage the flexible ad-hoc reasoning of LLMs as subroutines while encouraging programmatic reasoning via the top-level program. We train CoGEX models by adapting the recent Alpaca instruction tuning dataset\u00a0(Taori et\u00a0al., 2023) into a set of analogous Pythonic examples by prompting GPT-4 to perform the conversion, and then use the resulting CoGEX dataset to fine-tune smaller (7B and 13B) LMs to answer instructions via code.   The CoGEX paradigm allows us to explore a new way to learn new tasks: identifying a general program that applies across a task, such that new task instances can be solved by emulating calls to that one program.

We train the model to not only output the result of pseudo-executing the code but also the results of intermediate function calls in the code. This gives us an improved level of interpretability and systematicity. CoGEX thus suggests a way to leverage the flexible ad-hoc reasoning of LLMs as subroutines while encouraging programmatic reasoning via the top-level program. We train CoGEX models by adapting the recent Alpaca instruction tuning dataset\u00a0(Taori et\u00a0al., 2023) into a set of analogous Pythonic examples by prompting GPT-4 to perform the conversion, and then use the resulting CoGEX dataset to fine-tune smaller (7B and 13B) LMs to answer instructions via code.   The CoGEX paradigm allows us to explore a new way to learn new tasks: identifying a general program that applies across a task, such that new task instances can be solved by emulating calls to that one program.

Although successful, these works have mostly evaluated on tasks conducive to a programmatic paradigm, such as symbolic manipulation or algorithmic reasoning \u2013 where a clear compilable program can be envisioned. However, it is unclear how to apply this approach to \u201csofter\u201d reasoning tasks such as commonsense and social reasoning tasks, where algorithmic solutions are less obvious (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023a).   Figure 1: Example from the CoGEX dataset automatically converted from an Alpaca\u00a0(Taori et\u00a0al., 2023) instance via LLM prompting. We train the model to receive the instruction and input and generate the Python program and function call (as an intermediate), before outputting the final dictionary that contains the answer and any intermediate reasoning steps.     Our goal is to expand an LM\u2019s program synthesis skills to such softer reasoning tasks. Our approach leverages the insight that as well as synthesizing code, LMs can also emulate the execution of code, including emulating function calls defined only by name and documentation, but lacking full code implementation. Such pseudo-programs may include both well-defined reasoning steps such as math or algorithmic tasks, as well as function calls for less precise forms of reasoning, such as commonsense. This work explores whether such programs can be generated and pseudo-executed to solve soft reasoning tasks as well as traditional algorithmic tasks.   To achieve this, we propose a novel approach: training models to follow NL instructions by generating a program and then emulating that program\u2019s code execution. Our paradigm, called CoGEX, changes the inference process to (1) generate a Python function given an arbitrary instruction and optional input, (2) generate a call to that function, and (3) produce the result of simulating its execution. Unlike other work\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2023b; Li et\u00a0al., 2023), we do not use a Python interpreter to execute any code; rather, the model is trained to emulate execution. This allows the generated code to deliberately include calls to underspecified functions (i.e., where only the function name and documentation are included), because the LM execution emulator is able to speculate on those functions\u2019 behaviors using its latent knowledge. We train the model to not only output the result of pseudo-executing the code but also the results of intermediate function calls in the code. This gives us an improved level of interpretability and systematicity. CoGEX thus suggests a way to leverage the flexible ad-hoc reasoning of LLMs as subroutines while encouraging programmatic reasoning via the top-level program.

It can also improve the interpretability and systematicity of AI systems, leading to more transparent and grounded explanations for their decisions. Addressing this question could advance knowledge in the field of AI and enable practical applications in various domains that require nuanced reasoning abilities.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in training language models to not only generate code but also emulate the execution of that code, especially for softer reasoning tasks where algorithmic solutions are less obvious. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of reasoning tasks that require a combination of well-defined steps and underspecified functions. Overcoming technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles in modeling ad-hoc reasoning and programmatic reasoning simultaneously is crucial for success.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on training language models for traditional algorithmic tasks, overlooking the need for softer reasoning capabilities. The integration of symbolic reasoning techniques with neural language models to enhance interpretability and reasoning has not been extensively explored. By proposing a novel approach like CoGEX, which combines ad-hoc reasoning with programmatic reasoning, this gap in research can be addressed, leading to improved performance on softer reasoning tasks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves training models to follow NL instructions by generating a program and emulating its code execution. The CoGEX paradigm changes the inference process to generate a Python function, call that function, and simulate its execution. The expected outcomes include enhanced interpretability, systematicity, and performance on softer reasoning tasks, as well as the advancement of AI systems in handling a broader range of reasoning challenges.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 8fe2f5d5-7bb2-4d6a-bcfd-5a6f4c1914e6 \nFrom agent1 to agent2: I am interested in collaborating with you to brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the intersection of natural language processing and cognitive science.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Modeling the temporal associations between consecutive inputs in a sequence (i.e., sequential memory) enables biological agents to perform various cognitive functions, such as episodic memory formation\u00a0[45, 55, 14], complex action planning\u00a0[20] and translating between languages\u00a0[3]. For example, playing a musical instrument requires remembering the sequence of notes in a piece of music; similarly, playing a game of chess requires simulating, planning, and executing a sequence of moves in a specific order. While the ability to form such memories of static, unrelated events has been extensively studied\u00a0[48, 47, 54, 59, 57], the ability of biologically-plausible artificial networks to learn and recall temporally-dependent patterns has not been sufficiently explored in literature\u00a0[53]. The task of sequential memory is considered challenging for models operating under biological constraints (i.e., local synaptic computations) for many reasons, including catastrophic forgetting, ambiguous context representations, multiple future possibilities, etc.   In addition to the biological constraint, we impose the following set of desirable characteristics as learning constraints on sequence memory models.     \u2022  The learning of one sequence does not overwrite the previously learned sequences. This property is defined under the continual learning framework as avoiding catastrophic forgetting and evaluated with the Backward Transfer (BWT) metric\u00a0[34].    \u2022  The model should uniquely encode inputs based on their context in a sequence. Consider the sequence of letters \u201cEVER\u201d; the representation of \u201cE\u201d at position 1 should be different from \u201cE\u201d at position 3, thus resulting in different predictions: \u201cV\u201d and \u201cR\u201d. Moreover, the representation of \u201cE\u201d at position 3 in \u201cEVER\u201d should be different from \u201cE\u201d at position 3 in \u201cCLEVER\u201d. Therefore, positional encoding is not a valid solution.    \u2022  When presented with multiple valid, future possibilities, the model should learn to represent each possibility separately yet stochastically sample a single valid possibility. Consider the two sequences \u201cTHAT\u201d and \u201cTHEY\u201d; after seeing \u201cTH\u201d, the model should learn to generate either \u201cA\u201d or \u201cE\u201d, but not an average\u00a0[33] or a union of both\u00a0[23].    \u2022  The model should be capable of incrementally learning each transition without seeing the whole sequence or revisiting older sequence transitions that are previously learned. This property falls under online learning constraints, also called stream learning\u00a0[40, 23].    \u2022  The learning algorithm should be tolerant and robust to significant input noise. A model should continuously clean the noisy inputs using learned priors and beliefs, thus performing future predictions based on the noise-free observations\u00a0[23].      We propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), which consists of a state prediction model and a generative attractor model. The predictor in PAM is inspired by the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)\u00a0[23] learning algorithm, where a group of neurons in the same cortical minicolumn share the same receptive feedforward connection from the sensory input on their proximal dendrites. The depolarization of the voltage of any neuron in a single minicolumn (i.e., on distal dendrites) primes this depolarized neuron to fire first while inhibiting all the other neurons in the same minicolumn from firing (i.e., competitive learning). The choice of which neurons fire within the same minicolumn is based on the previously active neurons and their trainable synaptic weights to the depolarized neurons, which gives rise to a unique context representation for every input.\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

For example, playing a musical instrument requires remembering the sequence of notes in a piece of music; similarly, playing a game of chess requires simulating, planning, and executing a sequence of moves in a specific order. While the ability to form such memories of static, unrelated events has been extensively studied\u00a0[48, 47, 54, 59, 57], the ability of biologically-plausible artificial networks to learn and recall temporally-dependent patterns has not been sufficiently explored in literature\u00a0[53]. The task of sequential memory is considered challenging for models operating under biological constraints (i.e., local synaptic computations) for many reasons, including catastrophic forgetting, ambiguous context representations, multiple future possibilities, etc.   In addition to the biological constraint, we impose the following set of desirable characteristics as learning constraints on sequence memory models.     \u2022  The learning of one sequence does not overwrite the previously learned sequences. This property is defined under the continual learning framework as avoiding catastrophic forgetting and evaluated with the Backward Transfer (BWT) metric\u00a0[34].    \u2022  The model should uniquely encode inputs based on their context in a sequence. Consider the sequence of letters \u201cEVER\u201d; the representation of \u201cE\u201d at position 1 should be different from \u201cE\u201d at position 3, thus resulting in different predictions: \u201cV\u201d and \u201cR\u201d. Moreover, the representation of \u201cE\u201d at position 3 in \u201cEVER\u201d should be different from \u201cE\u201d at position 3 in \u201cCLEVER\u201d. Therefore, positional encoding is not a valid solution.    \u2022  When presented with multiple valid, future possibilities, the model should learn to represent each possibility separately yet stochastically sample a single valid possibility. Consider the two sequences \u201cTHAT\u201d and \u201cTHEY\u201d; after seeing \u201cTH\u201d, the model should learn to generate either \u201cA\u201d or \u201cE\u201d, but not an average\u00a0[33] or a union of both\u00a0[23].    \u2022  The model should be capable of incrementally learning each transition without seeing the whole sequence or revisiting older sequence transitions that are previously learned. This property falls under online learning constraints, also called stream learning\u00a0[40, 23].    \u2022  The learning algorithm should be tolerant and robust to significant input noise. A model should continuously clean the noisy inputs using learned priors and beliefs, thus performing future predictions based on the noise-free observations\u00a0[23].      We propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), which consists of a state prediction model and a generative attractor model. The predictor in PAM is inspired by the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)\u00a0[23] learning algorithm, where a group of neurons in the same cortical minicolumn share the same receptive feedforward connection from the sensory input on their proximal dendrites. The depolarization of the voltage of any neuron in a single minicolumn (i.e., on distal dendrites) primes this depolarized neuron to fire first while inhibiting all the other neurons in the same minicolumn from firing (i.e., competitive learning). The choice of which neurons fire within the same minicolumn is based on the previously active neurons and their trainable synaptic weights to the depolarized neurons, which gives rise to a unique context representation for every input.\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

They replace i.i.d. samples with a correlated ensemble, carefully constructed to be more \u2018diverse\u2019 and hence improve approximation quality.   Such methods have been widely adopted in the Euclidean setting. For example, when sampling from isotropic distributions, one popular approach is to condition that samples are orthogonal: a trick that has proved successful in applications including dimensionality reduction (Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2017), evolution strategy methods in reinforcement learning (Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2018; Rowland et\u00a0al., 2018) and estimating sliced Wasserstein distances (Rowland et\u00a0al., 2019). \u2018Orthogonal Monte Carlo\u2019 has also been used to improve the convergence of random feature maps for kernel approximation (Yu et\u00a0al., 2016), including recently in attention approximation for scalable Transformers (Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2020). Intuitively, conditioning that samples are orthogonal prevents them from clustering together and ensures that they \u2018explore\u2019 \u211ddsuperscript\u211d\ud835\udc51\\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT better. In specific applications it is sometimes possible to derive rigorous theoretical guarantees (Reid et\u00a0al., 2023b).   Less clear is how these powerful ideas generalise to discrete space. Of particular interest are random walks on graphs, which sample a sequence of nodes connected by edges with some stopping criterion. Random walks are ubiquitous in machine learning and statistics (Xia et\u00a0al., 2019), providing a simple mechanism for unbiased graph sampling that can be implemented in a distributed way. However, slow diffusion times (especially for challenging graph topologies) can lead to poor convergence and downstream performance.   Our key contribution is the first (to our knowledge) quasi-Monte Carlo scheme that correlates the directions of an ensemble of graph random walkers to improve estimator accuracy. By conditioning that walkers \u2018repel\u2019 in a particular way that leaves the marginal walk probabilities unmodified, we are able to provably suppress the variance of various estimators whilst preserving their unbiasedness. We derive strong theoretical guarantees and observe large performance gains for algorithms estimating three disparate quantities: graph kernels (Choromanski, 2023), the PageRank vector (Avrachenkov et\u00a0al., 2007) and graphlet concentrations (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016).   Related work: The poor mixing of random walkers on graphs is well-documented and various schemes exist to try to improve estimator convergence. Most directly modify the base Markov chain by changing the transition probabilities, but without altering the walker\u2019s stationary distribution and therefore leaving asymptotic estimators (e.g.\u00a0based on empirical node occupations) unmodified. The canonical example of such a scheme is non-backtracking walks which do not permit walkers to return to their most recently visited node (Alon et\u00a0al., 2007; Diaconis et\u00a0al., 2000; Lee et\u00a0al., 2012). More involved schemes allow walkers to interact with their entire history (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2015; Doshi et\u00a0al., 2023). Many of these strategies provide theoretical guarantees that the asymptotic variance of estimators is reduced, but crucially the marginal probabilities of sampling different walks are modified so they cannot be applied to non-asymptotic estimators that rely on particular known marginal transition probabilities.

Such methods have been widely adopted in the Euclidean setting. For example, when sampling from isotropic distributions, one popular approach is to condition that samples are orthogonal: a trick that has proved successful in applications including dimensionality reduction (Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2017), evolution strategy methods in reinforcement learning (Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2018; Rowland et\u00a0al., 2018) and estimating sliced Wasserstein distances (Rowland et\u00a0al., 2019). \u2018Orthogonal Monte Carlo\u2019 has also been used to improve the convergence of random feature maps for kernel approximation (Yu et\u00a0al., 2016), including recently in attention approximation for scalable Transformers (Choromanski et\u00a0al., 2020).

Of particular interest are random walks on graphs, which sample a sequence of nodes connected by edges with some stopping criterion. Random walks are ubiquitous in machine learning and statistics (Xia et\u00a0al., 2019), providing a simple mechanism for unbiased graph sampling that can be implemented in a distributed way. However, slow diffusion times (especially for challenging graph topologies) can lead to poor convergence and downstream performance.   Our key contribution is the first (to our knowledge) quasi-Monte Carlo scheme that correlates the directions of an ensemble of graph random walkers to improve estimator accuracy. By conditioning that walkers \u2018repel\u2019 in a particular way that leaves the marginal walk probabilities unmodified, we are able to provably suppress the variance of various estimators whilst preserving their unbiasedness. We derive strong theoretical guarantees and observe large performance gains for algorithms estimating three disparate quantities: graph kernels (Choromanski, 2023), the PageRank vector (Avrachenkov et\u00a0al., 2007) and graphlet concentrations (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016).   Related work: The poor mixing of random walkers on graphs is well-documented and various schemes exist to try to improve estimator convergence. Most directly modify the base Markov chain by changing the transition probabilities, but without altering the walker\u2019s stationary distribution and therefore leaving asymptotic estimators (e.g.\u00a0based on empirical node occupations) unmodified. The canonical example of such a scheme is non-backtracking walks which do not permit walkers to return to their most recently visited node (Alon et\u00a0al., 2007; Diaconis et\u00a0al., 2000; Lee et\u00a0al., 2012). More involved schemes allow walkers to interact with their entire history (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2015; Doshi et\u00a0al., 2023). Many of these strategies provide theoretical guarantees that the asymptotic variance of estimators is reduced, but crucially the marginal probabilities of sampling different walks are modified so they cannot be applied to non-asymptotic estimators that rely on particular known marginal transition probabilities.

Face swapping, also known as Deepfakes, is one of the most well-known techniques for generating forged facial images. It replaces the face of a target individual with that of a source person to create a seamless and realistic composite image\u00a0[43]. The widespread proliferation of Deepfakes content on social media platforms has raised significant security concerns, including the spread of disinformation, fraud, and impersonation. As a result, developing effective and generalizable face forgery detection methods to counter these malicious attacks has become a critical challenge in the field of computer vision.   The growing diversity of facial forgery techniques has spurred interest in the general face forgery detection task\u00a0[40, 37, 26], which aims to develop models that detect forgeries from unseen domains. Previous approaches primarily utilize forgery simulation\u00a0[22, 35, 3, 38] to augment data by simulating various forgery traces, or framework engineering to enhance generalization through specialized designs like contrastive learning, attention mechanisms, and reconstruction learning\u00a0[41, 50, 39, 2, 12]. However, their generalization capabilities remain limited due to the reliance on simulating specific forgery artifacts or designing specialized architectures tailored to certain manipulation techniques.   In this paper, we aim to identify the universal features common to all Deepfake faces by revisiting the generative process underlying forged face images. As depicted in Figure\u00a01 (a), this process can be distilled into two key steps: (1) a feature extractor module captures salient features from both the source and target images; (2) these features are seamlessly fused through a generalized feature blending module to synthesize a novel Deepfake image. While the specific implementation of feature extraction and fusion may vary across different forgery methods, ranging from learning-based to graphics-based approaches, they all adhere to this fundamental generative paradigm.   Through this analysis, we uncover a crucial insight: Deepfake images inherently amalgamate information from both source and target faces, whereas genuine images maintain a consistent identity throughout. This amalgamated information can manifest as low-level artifacts, such as injection noise patterns and spectral discrepancies, or as high-level attributes, including facial expressions and mouth movements, depending on the specific forgery method employed.   Building upon this insight, we raise a question: Can we invert the generative process to extract and leverage the amalgamated source and target features, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of existing forgery detectors?   To answer this question, we introduce DiffusionFake, a novel plug-and-play framework that harnesses the power of Stable Diffusion to guide the forgery detector in learning disentangled source and target features inherent in Deepfakes. The core idea behind DiffusionFake is to inject the features extracted by the detector into a frozen pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, compelling the detector to capture the amalgamated source and target information by optimizing the features to reconstruct the corresponding source and target images.

Face swapping, also known as Deepfakes, is one of the most well-known techniques for generating forged facial images. It replaces the face of a target individual with that of a source person to create a seamless and realistic composite image\u00a0[43]. The widespread proliferation of Deepfakes content on social media platforms has raised significant security concerns, including the spread of disinformation, fraud, and impersonation. As a result, developing effective and generalizable face forgery detection methods to counter these malicious attacks has become a critical challenge in the field of computer vision.   The growing diversity of facial forgery techniques has spurred interest in the general face forgery detection task\u00a0[40, 37, 26], which aims to develop models that detect forgeries from unseen domains. Previous approaches primarily utilize forgery simulation\u00a0[22, 35, 3, 38] to augment data by simulating various forgery traces, or framework engineering to enhance generalization through specialized designs like contrastive learning, attention mechanisms, and reconstruction learning\u00a0[41, 50, 39, 2, 12]. However, their generalization capabilities remain limited due to the reliance on simulating specific forgery artifacts or designing specialized architectures tailored to certain manipulation techniques.   In this paper, we aim to identify the universal features common to all Deepfake faces by revisiting the generative process underlying forged face images. As depicted in Figure\u00a01 (a), this process can be distilled into two key steps: (1) a feature extractor module captures salient features from both the source and target images; (2) these features are seamlessly fused through a generalized feature blending module to synthesize a novel Deepfake image. While the specific implementation of feature extraction and fusion may vary across different forgery methods, ranging from learning-based to graphics-based approaches, they all adhere to this fundamental generative paradigm.   Through this analysis, we uncover a crucial insight: Deepfake images inherently amalgamate information from both source and target faces, whereas genuine images maintain a consistent identity throughout. This amalgamated information can manifest as low-level artifacts, such as injection noise patterns and spectral discrepancies, or as high-level attributes, including facial expressions and mouth movements, depending on the specific forgery method employed.   Building upon this insight, we raise a question: Can we invert the generative process to extract and leverage the amalgamated source and target features, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of existing forgery detectors?   To answer this question, we introduce DiffusionFake, a novel plug-and-play framework that harnesses the power of Stable Diffusion to guide the forgery detector in learning disentangled source and target features inherent in Deepfakes.
