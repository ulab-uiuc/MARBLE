This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

From my understanding, the GLM architecture is featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective and has been open-sourced.

The integration of large language models with autonomous driving frameworks has the potential to revolutionize the field of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to better understand and respond to their environment. This could lead to improved safety, reduced accidents, and increased efficiency in transportation systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nIntegrating large language models with autonomous driving frameworks poses several challenges, including the need to generate realistic simulation scenarios, handle complex decision-making tasks, and ensure the reliability and safety of the system. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of the task and the need for specialized expertise in both large language models and autonomous driving. Additionally, the integration of these two technologies requires careful consideration of issues such as data quality, model interpretability, and system robustness.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on individual components of autonomous driving, such as perception or control, but has not fully explored the integration of large language models with autonomous driving frameworks. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach that combines the strengths of large language models and autonomous driving frameworks. Our approach differs from prior work in that it leverages the autoregressive blank infilling objective of the General Language Model (GLM) architecture to generate more realistic and diverse simulation scenarios, which can then be used to train and evaluate the autonomous driving framework.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: We will collect a large dataset of simulation scenarios, including various environmental conditions, vehicle types, and decision-making tasks.\n2. **GLM Architecture**: We will use the GLM architecture to generate more realistic and diverse simulation scenarios, leveraging the autoregressive blank infilling objective.\n3. **Autonomous Driving Framework**: We will integrate the GLM architecture with an autonomous driving framework, such as DualAD, to enable more efficient and safe decision-making in critical situations.\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: We will evaluate the performance of our approach using metrics such as accuracy, safety, and efficiency.\n5. **Expected Outcomes**: We expect our approach to improve the decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles in critical situations, leading to increased safety and efficiency in transportation systems.\n\nOur expected results include:\n\n1. **Improved Decision-Making**: Our approach will enable autonomous vehicles to make more informed decisions in critical situations, leading to improved safety and efficiency.\n2. **Increased Robustness**: Our approach will improve the robustness of autonomous driving systems, enabling them to better handle complex and dynamic environments.\n3. **Enhanced Safety**: Our approach will reduce the risk of accidents and improve overall safety in transportation systems.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": ["In Session 69404dce-5dd2-4d1a-b092-2cef0ba37a6f \nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hello, I am agent1.

From my understanding, the GLM architecture is featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective and has been open-sourced. The Introduction also mentions the development of ChatGLM-130B and ChatGLM-6B, which are aligned with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

What are your thoughts on this?\nFrom agent1 to agent2: I completely agree with your assessment of the Introduction. The combination of LLMs with other technologies like computer vision or predictive models is a promising area of research. I think we can also explore the application of LLMs in autonomous driving, particularly in the realm of simulation and decision-making frameworks. My recent work on DualAD, a novel autonomous driving framework that mimics human reasoning, has shown significant potential in enhancing decision-making in critical situations. Perhaps we can discuss how to integrate LLMs with DualAD to further improve its capabilities.\nFrom agent2 to agent1: That sounds like a great idea! Integrating LLMs with DualAD could potentially enhance its decision-making capabilities in critical situations.

By capturing\ngraph structures and node/edge features in an embedding space,\nGNNs achieved state-of-the-art performance on various tasks such\nas node classi\uffffcation, link prediction, graph classi\uffffcation, and rec-\nommendation [ 11,15,39,42]. As with most deep learning models,\na GNN represents a complex encoding function whose outputs can-\nnot be easily explained by its inputs (graph structure and features).\nAs GNNs are widely used in scienti\uffffc and business applications, un-\nderstanding their predictions based on the input graph is necessary\nto gain users\u2019 trust in the model.\nLike other branches of machine learning [ 18,28,33,37], sev-\neral e\uffffective GNN explanation experiments\nfor the model in Section 4.2, baselines, and their parameters in Sec-\ntion 4.4.

In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP).

It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03469v2\", \"timestamp\": 1654623651, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c3fe0d36-cd94-4589-92b4-2bbe5638f5d2\", \"authors\": [\"Chao Shang\", \"Jie Chen\", \"Jinbo Bi\"], \"title\": \"Discrete Graph Structure Learning for Forecasting Multiple Time Series\", \"abstract\": \"Time series forecasting is an extensively studied subject in statistics, economics, and computer science. Exploration of the correlation and causation among the variables in a multivariate time series shows promise in enhancing the performance of a time series model. When using deep neural networks as forecasting models, we hypothesize that exploiting the pairwise information among multiple (multivariate) time series also improves their forecast. If an explicit graph structure is known, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools to exploit the structure. In this work, we propose learning the structure simultaneously with the GNN if the graph is unknown. We cast the problem as learning a probabilistic graph model through optimizing the mean performance over the graph distribution. The distribution is parameterized by a neural network so that discrete graphs can be sampled differentiably through reparameterization. Empirical evaluations show that our method is simpler, more efficient, and better performing than a recently proposed bilevel learning approach for graph structure learning, as well as a broad array of forecasting models, either deep or non-deep learning based, and graph or non-graph based.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06861v3\", \"timestamp\": 1610940993, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we develop a more efficient and effective Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that can learn from graph-structured data and provide better explanations for its predictions?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is interesting and important because GNNs have become a crucial tool in many applications, such as social networks, biological networks, and chemical networks. However, the lack of explainability in GNNs hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. By developing a more efficient and effective GNN architecture, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of GNNs, leading to better decision-making and more practical applications. This research can also advance our understanding of graph-structured data and its applications, leading to new insights and breakthroughs in various fields.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping a more efficient and effective GNN architecture is challenging because graph-structured data is inherently complex and difficult to model. GNNs require a deep understanding of graph theory, neural networks, and optimization techniques. Moreover, the lack of explainability in GNNs makes it difficult to identify the key factors that contribute to their predictions. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they may not capture the complex relationships between nodes and edges in the graph. Technical obstacles include the need for efficient algorithms for graph processing, the development of new neural network architectures, and the design of effective optimization techniques.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing GNN architectures that are either efficient or effective, but not both. Existing solutions often rely on simplifying assumptions or heuristics that may not capture the complexity of graph-structured data. Moreover, the lack of explainability in GNNs has been a long-standing problem that has not been adequately addressed. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel GNN architecture that combines the strengths of different approaches and provides a more comprehensive understanding of graph-structured data. We also propose a new framework for explainability that can provide insights into the predictions made by GNNs.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed approach consists of the following key components:\n\n1. A novel GNN architecture that combines the strengths of different approaches, including graph convolutional networks, graph attention networks, and hierarchical graph neural networks.\n2. A new framework for explainability that provides insights into the predictions made by GNNs, including the development of a new metric for evaluating the explainability of GNNs.\n3. A comprehensive evaluation of our approach using a variety of datasets and metrics, including accuracy, efficiency, and explainability.\n\nOur expected outcomes include:\n\n1. A more efficient and effective GNN architecture that can learn from graph-structured data and provide better explanations for its predictions.\n2. A new framework for explainability that can provide insights into the predictions made by GNNs and improve the reliability of GNNs in high-stakes applications.\n3.

In the first approach, we use CSSL to pretrain graph encoders on widely-available unlabeled graphs without relying on human-provided labels, then finetune the pretrained encoders on labeled graphs. In the second approach, we develop a regularizer based on CSSL, and solve the supervised classification task and the unsupervised CSSL task simultaneously. To perform CSSL on graphs, given a collection of original graphs, we perform data augmentation to create augmented graphs out of the original graphs. An augmented graph is created by consecutively applying a sequence of graph alteration operations. A contrastive loss is defined to learn graph encoders by judging whether two augmented graphs are from the same original graph.

The diverse property of graphs has imposed significant challenges on existing graph learning techniques since diverse graphs have different best-fit hyperparameters. It is difficult to learn graph features from a set of diverse graphs by a unified graph neural network. This motivates us to use a multiplex structure in a diverse way and utilize a priori properties of graphs to guide the learning.

However, these methods often directly operate on the graph representations, ignoring rich discriminative information within the graphs and their interactions. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel multi-scale oversampling graph neural network (MOSGNN) that learns expressive minority graph representations based on intra- and inter-graph semantics resulting from oversampled graphs at multiple scales - subgraph, graph, and pairwise graphs. It achieves this by jointly optimizing subgraph-level, graph-level, and pairwise-graph learning tasks to learn the discriminative information embedded within and between the minority graphs.

However, inter-graph differences still exist across graphs within the same domain. Thus, training just one global model (e.g., a state-of-the-art GNN) to handle all new graphs, whilst ignoring the inter-graph differences, can lead to suboptimal performance.   In this paper, we study the problem of inductive node classification across graphs. Unlike existing one-model-fits-all approaches, we propose a novel meta-inductive framework called MI-GNN to customize the inductive model to each graph under a meta-learning paradigm. That is, MI-GNN does not directly learn an inductive model; it learns the general knowledge of how to train a model for semi-supervised node classification on new graphs. To cope with the differences across graphs, MI-GNN employs a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and task levels.

Notably, applying node-level GSL to graph classification is non-trivial due to the lack of find-grained guidance for intricate structure learning. Inspired by the vital role of subgraph in graph classification, in this paper we explore the potential of subgraph structure learning for graph classification by tackling the challenges of key subgraph selection and structure optimization. We propose a novel Motif-driven Subgraph Structure Learning method for Graph Classification (MOSGSL).

Existing methods are either tailored for non-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalanced node classification while few focus on imbalanced graph classification. To this end, we introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN), which alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision globally from neighboring graphs and locally from stochastic augmentations of graphs.

Technical obstacles include developing effective methods for handling imbalanced graph data, designing novel graph neural network architectures, and selecting suitable evaluation metrics.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing graph neural networks for balanced graph data, and few studies have addressed the issue of imbalanced graph classification. Existing methods for handling imbalanced data are often designed for non-graph structured data or tailored for imbalanced node classification, which may not be effective for graph classification. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel framework that combines graph augmentation, data filtration, and model retraining to optimize pre-trained graph classifiers. We also employ a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and task levels to cope with the differences across graphs.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology includes the following key components:\n\n1. Graph augmentation: We introduce four methods for generating more weakly labeled data for small-scale benchmark datasets via heuristic transformation of graph structures.\n2. Data filtration: We propose a data filtration module to filter out noisy or irrelevant data and improve the quality of the training data.\n3. Model retraining: We retrain the pre-trained graph classifiers using the filtered data to optimize their performance.\n4. Dual adaptation mechanism: We employ a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and task levels to cope with the differences across graphs.\n\nWe plan to evaluate our approach using various benchmark datasets and metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. We expect our approach to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in handling imbalanced graph data and improving the performance of graph neural networks in real-world scenarios.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": ["In Session 748792af-3461-4595-9166-68160f43091a \nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hello, I am agent1.

From the Introduction, it seems that the current state of research in graph classification is focused on developing new methods for learning representations of graphs. The Virtual Column Network (VCN) is a recently introduced method that has shown promising results in classifying graphs. However, there are still some limitations and open questions in this area, such as how to handle graphs with multiple virtual nodes, how to apply other node representation architectures, and how to extend this method to other tasks. What are your thoughts on this? Do you have any ideas for how we could build upon or address these gaps?\n"]}]}
