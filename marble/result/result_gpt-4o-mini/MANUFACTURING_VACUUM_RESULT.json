For example, the `suppliers` and `customers` tables have high sequential scans with no index scans, suggesting that queries on these tables may be inefficient due to the lack of appropriate indexes.\n\n2. **Agent 2** provided general statistics about user tables but did not highlight any specific issues related to performance or locking.\n\n3. **Agent 3** checked for active processes that might be causing **LOCK_CONTENTION** but found no blocking processes, indicating that lock contention may not be a significant issue at this time.\n\n4. **Agent 4** encountered an error while querying, which does not provide useful information for diagnosing the performance issues.\n\n5. **Agent 5** focused on large data retrieval operations and provided execution times for various queries. However, it did not directly indicate any specific issues related to the root causes listed.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely causes of the database anomaly appear to be:\n\n- **MISSING_INDEXES**: The high number of sequential scans with minimal index usage suggests that the database may benefit from additional indexes to improve query performance.\n\n- **FETCH_LARGE_DATA**: The execution times reported by Agent 5 indicate that some queries are taking a long time to execute, which could be related to fetching large amounts of data.\n\nTherefore, the decision is to focus on **MISSING_INDEXES** and **FETCH_LARGE_DATA** as the two most likely causes of the database performance issues. Further investigation into the specific queries and their execution plans may be warranted to confirm these hypotheses."}}
