LOCK_CONTENTION: Agent2 identified lock contention as a potential root cause, as there are locks in the database that may be causing contention and impacting performance.\n\n3. REDUNDANT_INDEX: Agent4 highlighted the presence of indexes with low or zero access counts, indicating potential redundancy. Redundant indexes can impact performance by slowing down write operations.\n\nTherefore, the most likely causes of the database anomaly are INSERT_LARGE_DATA, LOCK_CONTENTION, and REDUNDANT_INDEX.
