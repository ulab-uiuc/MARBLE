I will investigate how locks are affecting the database performance in the context of data inserts.\nFrom agent2 to agent1: Based on the previous query on the `pg_locks` table, you identified two lock types: 'AccessShareLock' and 'ExclusiveLock'. These locks can indicate potential lock contention issues during data inserts. AccessShareLock allows concurrent reads but prevents writes, while ExclusiveLock restricts both reads and writes. Analyze the distribution and frequency of these locks during large data inserts to determine if they are causing performance bottlenecks.
