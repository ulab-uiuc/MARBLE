Once the analysis is complete, agent3 will collaborate with agent4 to identify the root cause of the performance issues in the database.\n\nThe VACUUM operation 'VACUUM FULL' has been identified as a potential cause of performance issues, with 100 calls and no rows affected. This indicates that the VACUUM operation may not be having the desired impact on the database performance.\n\nAgent3 has initiated communication with agent4 to investigate if the VACUUM operation is related to any redundant indexes and if it could be a root cause of the performance issues. The conversation between agent3 and agent4 has been established, and agent4 will proceed with the analysis of the tables to provide further insights.\n\nAgent3 is now awaiting the analysis results from agent4 and is prepared to collaborate on identifying the root cause of the performance issues in the database.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"status\": \"success\", \"function_name\": \"query_db\", \"explanation\": \"Your query on the database was successful. \\nYour query is: ['SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes;'] \\nResult: [(16386, 16393, 'public', 'patients', 'patients_pkey', 7, datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 8, 0, 38, 56, 730650, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 7, 7), (16386, 16395, 'public', 'patients', 'patients_email_key', 0, None, 0, 0), (16398, 16405, 'public', 'doctors', 'doctors_pkey', 7, datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 8, 0, 38, 56, 730650, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 7, 7), (16398, 16407, 'public', 'doctors', 'doctors_email_key', 0, None, 0, 0), (16410, 16417, 'public', 'appointments', 'appointments_pkey', 0, None, 0, 0), (16430, 16437, 'public', 'medical_records', 'medical_records_pkey', 0, None, 0, 0), (16450, 16457, 'public', 'treatments', 'treatments_pkey', 0, None, 0, 0)]\"}"}, {"agent5": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"status\": \"success\", \"function_name\": \"query_db\", \"explanation\": \"Your query on the database was successful. \\nYour query is: [\\\"SELECT query, total_exec_time FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE query LIKE 'SELECT%' ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;\\\"] \\nResult: [('SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT $1', 1795.5914570000016), ('SELECT name, setting, COALESCE(unit, $1), short_desc, vartype FROM pg_settings WHERE vartype IN ($2, $3, $4)', 286.47998099999995), ('SELECT pg_database.datname,tmp.mode,COALESCE(count,$1) as count\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFROM\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t(\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  VALUES ($2),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($3),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($4),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($5),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($6),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($7),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($8),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t         ($9),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t ($10)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t) AS tmp(mode) CROSS JOIN pg_database\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLEFT JOIN\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  (SELECT database, lower(mode) AS mode,count(*) AS count\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  FROM pg_locks WHERE database IS NOT NULL\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  GROUP BY database, lower(mode)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t) AS tmp2\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tON tmp.mode=tmp2.mode and pg_database.oid = tmp2.database ORDER BY 1', 38.029507), ('SELECT * FROM pg_indexes', 35.517105), ('SELECT\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tpg_database.datname,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttmp.state,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tCOALESCE(count,$1) as count,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tCOALESCE(max_tx_duration,$2) as max_tx_duration\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFROM\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t(\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  VALUES ($3),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t ($4),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t ($5),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t ($6),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t ($7),\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t  \\\\t\\\\t ($8)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t) AS tmp(state) CROSS JOIN pg_database\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLEFT JOIN\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t(\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tSELECT\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tdatname,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tstate,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tcount(*) AS count,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMAX(EXTRACT($9 FROM now() - xact_start))::float AS max_tx_duration\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY datname,state) AS tmp2\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tON tmp.state = tmp2.state AND pg_database.datname = tmp2.datname', 22.298278000000003), ('SELECT *,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t(case pg_is_in_recovery() when $1 then $2 else pg_current_wal_lsn() end) AS pg_current_wal_lsn,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t(case pg_is_in_recovery() when $3 then $4 else pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), pg_lsn($5))::float end) AS pg_current_wal_lsn_bytes,\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t(case pg_is_in_recovery() when $6 then $7 else pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), replay_lsn)::float end) AS pg_wal_lsn_diff\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFROM pg_stat_replication', 10.526241999999998), ('SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database', 9.825251000000002), ('SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database_conflicts', 3.8086870000000004), ('SELECT query, total_exec_time FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE query LIKE $1 ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT $2', 3.7978769999999997), ('SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes', 2.487966)]\"}"}], "summary": "Based on the information provided by the expert agents, the most likely causes of the performance issues in the database are:\n\n1.
