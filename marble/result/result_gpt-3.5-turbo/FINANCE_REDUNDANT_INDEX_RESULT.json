The communication session has been successfully completed, and both agents have exchanged insights on potential lock contention problems during INSERT operations.\n\nMoving forward, agent1 should focus on optimizing INSERT operations and collaborating with other agents to gain a comprehensive understanding of the performance issues in the database.\n"}, {"agent2": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"status\": \"success\", \"function_name\": \"query_db\", \"explanation\": \"Your query on the database was successful. \\nYour query is: ['SELECT mode, granted, pid, relation::regclass, virtualxid, transactionid, classid, objid, objsubid, virtualtransaction, pid::regclass, granted, fastpath FROM pg_locks;'] \\nResult: [('AccessShareLock', True, 56, 'pg_locks', None, None, None, None, None, '19/2', '56', True, True), ('ExclusiveLock', True, 56, None, '19/2', None, None, None, None, '19/2', '56', True, True)]\"}"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"status\": \"success\", \"function_name\": \"query_db\", \"explanation\": \"Your query on the database was successful but no data was returned. \\nYour query is: [\\\"SELECT query, calls, total_plan_time, rows, mean_plan_time FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE query LIKE 'VACUUM%';\\\"] \\nResult: []\"}"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:Based on the information gathered from the `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_indexes` tables, it appears that there are no redundant indexes identified.
