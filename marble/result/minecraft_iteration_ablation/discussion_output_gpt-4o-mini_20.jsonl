Agent1 should look for other chests in the vicinity.\n\n2. **Consider Crafting a Pickaxe**: \n   - If Agent1 has access to any wood or stone materials, they should consider crafting a pickaxe.

If agent1 has any blocks available (like dirt or any other block), they should place it there first.\n\n3. **Retry Placing the Dirt Block**:\n   - After placing a supporting block, agent1 can attempt to place the dirt block at `[-9, -56, 0]` again.\n\n4. **Seek Help if Necessary**:\n   - If agent1 does not have any blocks to place as support, they can ask other team members for assistance in retrieving or placing the necessary blocks.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Check Surrounding Blocks**:\n   ```plaintext\n   // Assess the current blocks around the target position\n   ```\n\n2. **Place a Supporting Block** (if possible):\n   - If agent1 has any blocks available, place one at `[-9, -57, 0]`:\n   ```plaintext\n   placeBlock(\"dirt\", position=[-9, -57, 0], facing=\"y\") // Example if a block can be placed\n   ```\n\n3. **Retry Placing the Dirt Block**:\n   ```plaintext\n   placeBlock(\"dirt\", position=[-9, -56, 0], facing=\"y\")\n   ```\n\n### Example Action Steps:\n1. **Check Surrounding Blocks**:\n   ```plaintext\n   // Assess the current blocks around the target position\n   ```\n\n2. **Place a Supporting Block** (if applicable):\n   ```plaintext\n   placeBlock(\"dirt\", position=[-9, -57, 0], facing=\"y\") // Example if a block can be placed\n   ```\n\n3", "agent2": "Based on the current situation, agent2 is facing challenges in placing the dirt block at (-10, -57, 0) due to a lack of valid supporting blocks.
