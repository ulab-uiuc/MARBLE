The motivations behind these attacks involve protecting private data and commer- cial datasets from unauthorized use. For example, a ma- licious data collector may gather selfies from social me- dia apps into a facial image set. In this type of scenario, availability attacks provide tools to process user images be- fore release, preserving legibility but impeding subsequent training. In recent years, various availability attacks have been proposed (Feng et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2020; Fowl 1Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China2University of Chi- nese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.

Meanwhile, contrastive learning (CL) allows people to ex- tract meaningful features from unlabeled data in a self- supervised way. After subsequent linear probing or fine- tuning, CL algorithms have achieved comparable accuracy or even surpassed the performance of SL (Chen et al., 2020a;b; Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021). Thus, an unauthorized data collector can resort to contrastive learn- ing algorithms to train a usable model when supervised learning has failed. On one hand, most attacks designed for poisoning SL are ineffective against CL (refer to Table 1 and Section 3.2). It shed light on a potential issue of using availability attacks to protect data: a malicious data collec- tor can traverse both supervised and contrastive algorithms to effectively leverage collected data. On the other hand, the error minimization poisoning framework has been ex- tended to poison contrastive learning (He et al., 2022), and then components requiring label information have been in- corporated into contrastive error minimization to simul- taneously achieve supervised unlearnability besides con- trastive unlearnability (Ren et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a). Compared to SL-based ones, these CL-based Background and Related Works 2.1. Contrastive Learning Contrastive learning is self-supervised and does not require label information until linear probing or fine-tuning. In general, it first augments an input into two views using augmentations sampled from a strong augmentation distri- bution \u00b5. Then extracted features are trained to be aligned between positive pairs but distinct between negative pairs. Wang & Isola (2020) introduced two key properties for contrastive learning, alignment anduniformity . The former measures the similarity of features from positive pairs and the latter reflects the uniformity of feature distribution on the hypersphere. Let gbe a normalized feature extractor. Thealignment loss anduniformity loss on a dataset Dcare defined as the following: A(Dc) =E x\u223cDc \u03c0,\u03c4\u223c\u00b5\u0002 ||g(\u03c0(x))\u2212g(\u03c4(x))||2 2\u0003 , U(Dc) = log E x,z\u223cDc \u03c0,\u03c4\u223c\u00b5\u0002 e\u22122||g(\u03c0(x))\u2212g(\u03c4(z))||2 2\u0003 . LetD\u2032 cbe a poisoned version of a clean dataset Dc. The alignment gap anduniformity gap between clean and poi- soned datasets are defined as follows: AG=A(Dc)\u2212 A(D\u2032 c),UG=U(Dc)\u2212 U(D\u2032 c).(1) Intuitively, these gaps characterize the difference between clean features and poisoned features. We will check the re- lationship between these gaps and contrastive unlearnabil- ity in Section 3.2. 2.2.
