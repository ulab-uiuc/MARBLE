The game is set in various dynamic environments, and agents must communicate and coordinate their actions to succeed.\n\n**Solution Overview**\n\nThe solution consists of the following components:\n\n1.  **Game Environment**: The game environment is implemented in the `GameEnvironment` class, which generates objectives, adds agents, updates scores, and provides access to objectives, agents, and scores.\n2.  **AI Agents**: The AI agents are implemented in the `AI_Agent` class, which has different roles (e.g., attacker, defender, scout) and abilities (e.g., increased speed, healing, shielding). Agents can move, communicate, and receive messages.\n3.  **Communication System**: The communication system is implemented in the `CommunicationSystem` class, which allows agents to send and receive messages.\n4.  **Scoring System**: The scoring system is implemented in the `ScoringSystem` class, which rewards successful completion of objectives and penalizes failures or inefficient play.\n5.  **Team Tactics Game**: The Team Tactics game is implemented in the `TeamTactics` class, which creates a game environment, adds AI agents, starts the game, and provides access to the score.\n6.  **Test Cases**: The test cases are implemented in the `TestTeamTactics` class, which tests the game's functionality, including capturing the flag, defending the base, eliminating enemies, and edge cases.\n\n**Solution Code**\n\n```python\n# game_environment.py\nimport random\n\nclass GameEnvironment:\n    def __init__(self, level):\n        self.level = level\n        self.objectives = self.generate_objectives()\n        self.agents = []\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def generate_objectives(self):\n        objectives = []\n        if self.level == \"capture_the_flag\":\n            objectives.append({\"type\": \"capture_flag\", \"location\": (random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 100))})\n        elif self.level == \"defend_the_base\":\n            objectives.append({\"type\": \"defend_base\", \"location\": (random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 100))})\n        elif self.level == \"eliminate_enemies\":\n            objectives.append({\"type\": \"eliminate_enemies\", \"location\": (random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 100))})\n        return objectives\n\n    def add_agent(self, agent):\n        self.agents.append(agent)\n\n    def update_score(self, points):\n        self.score += points\n\n    def get_objectives(self):\n        return self.objectives\n\n    def get_agents(self):\n        return self.agents\n\n    def get_score(self):\n        return self.score\n\n\n# ai_agent.py\nclass AI_Agent:\n    def __init__(self, role, abilities):\n        self.role = role\n        self.abilities = abilities\n        self.location = (0, 0)\n        self.communication_system = CommunicationSystem()\n\n    def move(self, x, y):\n        self.location = (x, y)\n\n    def communicate(self, message):\n        self.communication_system.send_message(message)\n\n    def receive_message(self, message):\n        self.communication_system.receive_message(message)\n\n\n# communication_system.py\nclass CommunicationSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.messages = []\n\n    def send_message(self, message):\n        self.messages.append(message)\n\n    def receive_message(self, message):\n        self.messages.append(message)\n\n    def get_messages(self):\n        return self.messages\n\n\n# scoring_system.py\nclass ScoringSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def reward(self, points):\n        self.score += points\n\n    def penalize(self, points):\n        self.score -= points\n\n    def get_score(self):\n        return self.score\n\n\n# team_tactics.py\nclass TeamTactics:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.game_environment = None\n        self.ai_agents = []\n        self.scoring_system = ScoringSystem()\n\n    def create_game_environment(self, level):\n        self.game_environment = GameEnvironment(level)\n\n    def create_ai_agent(self, role, abilities):\n        ai_agent = AI_Agent(role, abilities)\n        self.ai_agents.append(ai_agent)\n        self.game_environment.add_agent(ai_agent)\n\n    def start_game(self):\n        objectives = self.game_environment.get_objectives()\n        for objective in objectives:\n            if objective[\"type\"] == \"capture_flag\":\n                self.capture_flag()\n            elif objective[\"type\"] == \"defend_base\":\n                self.defend_base()\n            elif objective[\"type\"] == \"eliminate_enemies\":\n                self.eliminate_enemies()\n\n    def capture_flag(self):\n        #

You will need to implement the `render_room`, `render_mashup`, and `handle_user_input` methods to create a functional frontend.\n\nAdditionally, the `Backend` class assumes that the user ID is always \"username\", which is not a valid assumption. You will need to modify the `create_room`, `create_mashup`, and `vote` methods to use the actual user ID.\n\nFinally, the `Database` class uses a SQLite database, which may not be suitable for a production environment.

FamilyAdventureQuest is a collaborative platform that creates interactive and educational quests for families to complete together. The application combines elements of storytelling, puzzles, and physical activities to encourage learning and bonding among family members. Each quest is designed to be completed in stages, with each stage building on the previous one to ensure a cohesive and engaging experience.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. **Quest Creation Module**: Develop a module where parents can create custom quests by selecting from a library of pre-defined storylines, puzzles, and physical challenges. The module should allow parents to set specific tasks, such as solving math problems, completing a scavenger hunt, or engaging in a physical activity. This module must be completed before any quests can be assigned to family members.\n   - 2. **Quest Assignment and Progress Tracking**: Implement a system for assigning quests to family members and tracking their progress. Each quest should have multiple stages, and completion of one stage should unlock the next. The system should notify family members when a new stage is available and provide real-time updates on their progress. This module depends on the completion of the Quest Creation Module.\n   - 3. **Interactive Storytelling**: Develop a feature that integrates an interactive storytelling component into each quest. The story should adapt based on the family's progress, providing feedback and encouragement. This feature should enhance the overall engagement and make the quest more immersive. The Interactive Storytelling feature depends on the Quest Assignment and Progress Tracking module being in place.\n   - 4. **Achievements and Rewards System**: Create a system that awards achievements and rewards to family members for completing quests and stages. Achievements can include badges, points, and virtual trophies. The system should also allow for the creation of leaderboards to foster a sense of competition and collaboration among family members. This module should be implemented after the Quest Assignment and Progress Tracking module is fully functional.\n   - 5. **Family Collaboration Tools**: Introduce tools that facilitate collaboration among family members, such as chat features, shared notes, and the ability to tag other family members in tasks. These tools should help family members communicate and coordinate their efforts effectively. This module depends on the Quest Assignment and Progress Tracking module being complete.\n\n\n2.

{"task": "Software Development Task:\n\nPlease write a graphics application called CollaborativeDesignSuite. CollaborativeDesignSuite is a multi-agent collaborative design tool that enables a team of designers to work together on a shared digital canvas, allowing them to create, edit, and manage graphic design projects in real-time. The application includes features for drawing shapes, applying textures, and organizing design elements, with a focus on seamless collaboration and dependency management.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Implement a user registration and authentication system to allow multiple designers to create accounts and log into the application. This must be completed before any collaborative features can be used.\n   - 2. **Real-Time Collaboration Canvas**: Develop a shared digital canvas where multiple designers can simultaneously draw, edit, and manipulate design elements. The canvas should support real-time updates, ensuring that all changes are visible to all participants. This feature depends on the completion of the user registration and authentication system.\n   - 3. **Shape and Texture Tools**: Integrate a set of tools for creating and editing geometric shapes and applying custom textures.

The application includes features for drawing shapes, applying textures, and organizing design elements, with a focus on seamless collaboration and dependency management.\n\n**Implementation Requirements**\n\nThe implementation requirements for the CollaborativeDesignSuite are as follows:\n\n1. **User Registration and Authentication**: A user registration and authentication system has been implemented to allow multiple designers to create accounts and log into the application.\n2. **Real-Time Collaboration Canvas**: A shared digital canvas has been developed where multiple designers can simultaneously draw, edit, and manipulate design elements.\n3. **Shape and Texture Tools**: A set of tools for creating and editing geometric shapes and applying custom textures has been integrated into the collaboration canvas.\n4. **Element Management and Organization**: Features for aligning, grouping, and arranging design elements within the canvas have been implemented.\n5. **Annotation and Commenting System**: A system for annotating and commenting on design elements has been developed.\n6. **Dependency Management**: Certain tasks within the application are dependent on the completion of others, ensuring that users cannot apply textures until shapes are created, and annotations are only available once the collaboration canvas is active.\n\n**Project Structure**\n\nThe project structure consists of a single file, `solution.py`, which contains all the implementation details.\n\n**Development Process**\n\nThe development process involved creating

ImageCanvasComposer is a graphics application that enables users to work with multiple image layers, apply filters, and blend them into a single, high-quality composite image, with features for layer management, effect application, and export options.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. Layer Management: Implement a system for creating, loading, and managing multiple image layers. Users should be able to add new layers, delete existing ones, and reorder layers within the canvas. This functionality must be completed before proceeding to the next step.\n   - 2. Graphical Effects and Filters: Develop a suite of graphical effects and filters that can be applied to individual layers or the entire canvas. Effects include but are not limited to brightness/contrast adjustments, color correction, blurring, and sharpening. This feature depends on the completion of the Layer Management system.\n   - 3. Blending and Composition: Introduce blending modes and composition tools that allow users to seamlessly combine layers. Users should be able to adjust the transparency, position, and size of each layer, as well as use alignment tools to ensure smooth transitions. This feature depends on the completion of both Layer Management and Graphical Effects and Filters.\n   - 4. Export and Save: Implement export and save functionalities that allow users to export the final composite image in various formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PSD).

Implementation requirements:\n   - The application should allow users to create and join teams, with each team having a unique name and description.\n   - Users should be able to set personal and team health and fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or endurance improvement. Goals should include a target value and a deadline.\n   - The application should provide a feature for creating and managing personal and team challenges. Challenges should include a title, description, start and end dates, and specific activities or exercises.\n   - Users should be able to log their daily activities and progress, which should be visible to other team members. The app should support logging of various metrics such as weight, distance, time, and calories burned.\n   - The application should include a communication feature that allows team members to send messages, share tips, and provide encouragement to one another.\n   - The application should generate notifications and reminders to keep users engaged and on track with their goals and challenges.\n   - The application should provide a dashboard that displays team progress, individual contributions, and overall performance metrics.\n   - Comprehensive test cases should be provided to validate the functionality of the application. Test cases should include scenarios for creating and joining teams, setting and tracking goals, logging activities, and using the communication features. Edge cases, such as invalid input and boundary conditions, should also be validated.\n\n\n2. Project structure:\n   - solution.py (main implementation)\n\n3.

If a task is delayed, players must reassign or adjust the project plan to keep the project on track. This step is dependent on the completion of the team management phase.\n   - 4. **Issue Resolution**: Players must identify and resolve issues that arise during the project.

The system provides features for event creation, task management, budgeting, communication, and dashboard analytics.\n\n**System Components**\n\n1. **Agent**: Represents an agent with a role and responsibilities.\n2. **Event**: Represents an event with details and tasks.\n3. **Task**: Represents a task with a deadline and status.\n4. **Budget**: Represents a budget with expenses and alerts.\n5. **Dashboard**: Represents a dashboard with event metrics.\n6. **CommunicationPlatform**: Represents a communication platform with chat, comments, and file sharing.\n\n**System Functionality**\n\n1. **Event Creation**: Agents can create events with details such as location, date, time, and guest list.\n2. **Task Management**: Agents can assign tasks to each other, set deadlines, and track progress.\n3. **Budgeting**: Agents can track expenses, set budgets, and receive alerts when costs exceed budget limits.\n4. **Communication**: Agents can communicate with each other through chat, comments, and file sharing.\n5. **Dashboard Analytics**: The system provides a dashboard with event metrics such as completion status, budget adherence, and guest satisfaction.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe system is implemented in Python and consists of a single file, `solution.py`.\n\n```python\n# event_organizer_collaborative.py\n\nclass Agent:\n

The program should allow multiple users to log in and manage their tasks, create new tasks, assign them to other team members, set deadlines and priorities, and monitor the progress of each task.\n\n**Agent Results**\n\nThree agents were involved in the task. Agent1 successfully created the solution file `solution.py` with the required implementation.

Vehicle Customization Module: Implement a vehicle customization module that enables AI agents to modify and upgrade their vehicles. This includes selecting vehicle types, adjusting performance parameters (speed, acceleration, handling), and adding special abilities (boosts, shields). The vehicle customization module should be completed after the track design module to ensure that vehicles are optimized for the specific tracks.\n   - 3. Racing Engine: Develop a racing engine that simulates the races on the custom tracks. The racing engine should handle real-time physics, collision detection, and scoring. AI agents must race against each other, and the engine should provide real-time feedback and performance metrics.

Implementation requirements:\n   - Develop a game environment with realistic physics and graphics to simulate the drifting mechanics.\n   - Implement a multiplayer system that allows multiple players to connect and race together in the same session.\n   - Design a coordination system where players can communicate and plan drifts to maximize the team's drift score. This includes a chat function and a visual indicator for optimal drift points on the track.\n   - Create a scoring system that rewards players for the duration, angle, and synchronization of their drifts, with bonus points for team coordination.\n   - Develop a track editor that allows players to create and share custom tracks with specific drift-friendly sections, ensuring that tracks are suitable for collaborative drifting.\n   - Implement a dependency system where the setup of the multiplayer environment (step 2) and the coordination system (step 3) must be completed before the scoring system (step 4) and track editor (step 5) can be fully functional.\n\n\n2.

However, it is just a starting point, and you will likely need to add additional features and functionality to make the application fully functional.\n\nTo run the application, save the code in a file named `solution.py` and run it using the command `python solution.py`. This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.\n\nNote that this code uses a SQLite database, which is a lightweight database that is suitable for small applications. However, for larger applications, you may want to consider using a more robust database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nAlso, this code does not include any error handling or security measures, which are important considerations for any web application. You should add these features as needed to make the application more robust and secure.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 26288, "agent_kpis": {"agent2": 1}, "total_milestones": 1, "code_quality": {"executability": 4, "instruction_following": 3, "quality": 3, "consistency": 4}}

Implementation requirements:\n   - The system should allow users to upload various types of sports match data, including video files, CSV files with performance metrics, and live data streams.\n   - Implement a user role system with different permissions for coaches, analysts, and players. Coaches should have full access to all features, analysts should be able to perform data analysis and share reports, and players should be able to view their performance metrics and receive feedback.\n   - The system should provide real-time collaboration features, such as shared notes, comments, and chat functionality, to facilitate communication among users during the analysis process.\n   - Develop a comprehensive suite of test cases to validate the system's functionality, including: \n- Uploading different file types and data formats \n- User role management and permission verification \n- Real-time collaboration features (e.g., shared notes, comments, and chat) \n- Performance metric calculations and report generation \n- Handling edge cases such as large file uploads, concurrent user edits, and network disruptions\n   - Ensure the system can handle large datasets efficiently and provide real-time updates without significant latency.\n   - The system should be scalable to support multiple teams and a large number of users, and it should include robust security measures to protect user data and privacy.\n\n\n2.

The program includes the following features:\n\n* Task definition: Users can define tasks, including specifying the task name, description, priority, and required resources.\n* Task assignment: The system supports the assignment of tasks to multiple agents, with the ability to dynamically reassign tasks based on agent availability and task urgency.\n* Real-time feedback: The application provides real-time feedback on task progress, including completion status, estimated time to completion, and any issues encountered.\n* Agent communication: The program includes a mechanism for agents to communicate and coordinate with each other.\n* Adaptability: The system can adapt to changing conditions, such as new tasks being added, tasks being completed ahead of schedule, or agents becoming unavailable.\n* User-friendly interface: The application includes a user-friendly interface for managing tasks and monitoring agent performance.\n\nThe program consists of the following classes:\n\n* Task: Represents a task with attributes such as name, description, priority, and required resources.\n* Agent: Represents an agent with attributes such as name, tasks, and availability.\n* TaskScheduler: Manages tasks and agents, including assigning tasks to agents, updating task status, and updating agent availability.\n\nThe program also includes a main function that demonstrates the usage of the TaskScheduler class.\n\nHere is the code for the MultiAgentTaskScheduler program:\n\n```python\n# task.py\nclass Task:\n    def __init__(self, name, description, priority,
