The application uses a dictionary to store notebooks and their corresponding code snippets, version control, and access control information.\n\nThe `CodeSync` class provides methods for creating, editing, getting, searching, and reverting notebooks. The `syntax_highlighting` and `code_completion` functions are placeholders for implementing syntax highlighting and code completion features for different programming languages.\n\nThe `test_real_time_collaboration`, `test_syntax_highlighting`, `test_code_completion`, `test_version_control`, `test_access_control`, and `test_search_functionality` functions are placeholders for implementing test cases for the corresponding features.\n\nThe `main` function provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the CodeSync application.\n\nNote that this is a basic implementation, and you may need to modify and extend it to meet the specific requirements of your project.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 33348, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 1, "agent2": 1}, "total_milestones": 2, "code_quality": {"instruction_following": 2, "quality": 3, "consistency": 3, "executability": 2}}

ProjectOrganizer is a project management tool that automates the creation, tracking, and completion of tasks, ensures that resources are allocated effectively, and provides real-time updates on project progress.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n   - 1. **Task Creation and Management**: Implement a module that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should include a description, due date, priority level, and assigned team members. This module must be completed before the Task Scheduling module can be developed.\n   - 2. **Task Scheduling**: Develop a module that schedules tasks based on dependencies and priority levels. The system should automatically adjust schedules when a task is completed or when changes are made to the project plan. This module depends on the completion of the Task Creation and Management module.\n   - 3. **Resource Allocation**: Create a module that allocates resources (e.g., personnel, equipment, budget) to tasks. The system should ensure that resources are not over-allocated and should provide alerts if a resource is at risk of being overused. This module depends on the completion of the Task Scheduling module.\n   - 4. **Real-Time Updates and Notifications**: Implement a module that provides real-time updates on the status of tasks and resources. Users should receive notifications when a task is completed, when a resource is over-allocated, or when a task is approaching its due date. This module depends on the completion of the Resource Allocation module.\n   - 5. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows project managers and team members to interact with the system.
