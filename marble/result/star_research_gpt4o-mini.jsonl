This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B.

Due to the high costs associated with human-subject experiments, various proxy metrics are often used to approximately quantify explanation quality. Generally, one possible interpretation of the quality of an explanation is its inherent value for teaching a related concept to a student. In this work, we extend artificial simulatability studies to the domain of graph neural networks. Instead of costly human trials, we use explanation-supervisable graph neural networks to perform simulatability studies to quantify the inherent usefulness of attributional graph explanations. We perform an extensive ablation study to investigate the conditions under which the proposed analyses are most meaningful. We additionally validate our methods applicability on real-world graph classification and regression datasets. We find that relevant explanations can significantly boost the sample efficiency of graph neural networks and analyze the robustness towards noise and bias in the explanations.

Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two prominent approaches towards explanations in GNNs, based on the concepts of mutual information (MI), and gradient-based explanations (GB). We discuss their suitability and empirically validate the properties of their explanations over different popular graph benchmarks. We find that unlike MI explanations, gradient-based explanations have three desirable properties. First, they are actionable: selecting inputs depending on them results in predictable changes in similarity scores. Second, they are consistent: the effect of selecting certain inputs overlaps very little with the effect of discarding them.

We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals.

This research could lead to the development of more transparent AI systems, ultimately advancing the field of explainable AI and influencing future research on model interpretability.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of GNNs arises from their intricate architectures and the high-dimensional nature of graph-structured data, making it challenging to trace how input features influence predictions. Naive approaches to interpretability often fail because they do not account for the unique properties of graphs, such as node and edge relationships. Additionally, existing explanation methods may be computationally expensive or provide unstable interpretations, which complicates their practical application in real-world scenarios.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on post-hoc explanation methods that do not integrate interpretability into the model design itself. These methods often struggle with providing stable and meaningful explanations, especially in complex graph structures. Barriers include a lack of standardized metrics for evaluating explanation quality and the computational challenges associated with analyzing large graphs. Our approach aims to incorporate interpretability directly into the GNN architecture, addressing these limitations by leveraging techniques such as causal learning and information bottlenecks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a novel GNN framework that integrates causal learning with information bottleneck theory to enhance interpretability.

To tackle this issue, meta-learning has been proposed to transfer structural knowledge from base classes with abundant labels to target novel classes. However, existing solutions become ineffective or inapplicable when base classes have no or limited labeled nodes. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method dubbed Virtual Node Tuning (VNT).

By leveraging multiple virtual nodes, we can capture more nuanced relationships and latent features within the graph, leading to improved classification accuracy. This advancement could pave the way for more effective applications in various fields, such as bioinformatics for drug discovery and cybersecurity for vulnerability detection, ultimately influencing future research directions in graph-based machine learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to effectively manage the interactions between multiple virtual nodes and the existing graph structure. Naive approaches may fail to capture the intricate dependencies and relationships among nodes, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge lies in optimizing the placement and representation of these virtual nodes to ensure they contribute meaningfully to the learning process without introducing noise or redundancy.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single virtual nodes or simplistic augmentations, which limits the depth of representation learning. Existing methods often overlook the potential of multiple virtual nodes to enhance feature extraction and classification. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive frameworks that can effectively integrate and optimize multiple virtual nodes within various graph architectures. Our approach aims to fill this gap by proposing a systematic method for incorporating multiple virtual nodes, thus enhancing the representation learning process.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components: \n1. **Method**: We will develop a framework that incorporates multiple virtual nodes into existing graph representation models, such as Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks.\n2. **Dataset**: We will utilize benchmark datasets from bioactivity prediction and software vulnerability detection, ensuring a diverse range of graph structures and label distributions.\n3. **Metrics**: Performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of our approach against baseline models.\n4. **Expected Outcomes**: We anticipate that our method will demonstrate superior performance in graph classification tasks, particularly in scenarios with sparse labels, thereby validating the utility of multiple virtual nodes in enhancing graph representation learning.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 72526, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 5, "agent3": 5, "agent4": 4}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Improved predictions of ionic conductivity and migration pathways can lead to the discovery of new materials with enhanced performance, ultimately impacting energy storage technologies and their applications in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. This research could pave the way for more efficient battery designs and contribute to the transition towards sustainable energy solutions.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of accurately modeling ionic motion in solid-state electrolytes arises from the need to account for various factors, including the material's atomic structure, temperature variations, and the influence of electric fields on ion migration. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate interactions between ions and the host lattice, which can lead to non-linear behaviors that are difficult to capture with simple models. Additionally, the computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, such as those based on density functional theory (DFT), poses significant challenges in exploring large parameter spaces.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on static properties of materials or has been limited to specific conditions, neglecting the dynamic behavior of ions under electric fields. Many studies have not integrated machine learning techniques effectively to predict ionic conductivity, leading to a lack of comprehensive models that can generalize across different materials. Our approach aims to bridge this gap by utilizing machine learning to analyze large datasets generated from DFT calculations, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of ionic migration in various conditions.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the development of a machine learning model trained on DFT-calculated data to predict ionic conductivities and migration pathways in solid-state electrolytes. We will use a dataset comprising various materials, focusing on their structural properties and ionic transport characteristics. Key metrics for evaluation will include root-mean-square errors (RMSE) for predicted ionic conductivities compared to experimental values.

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

However, grading open-ended questions can be time-consuming leading teachers to resort to simpler question formats or conduct fewer formative assessments. While there has been a longstanding interest in automating of short-answer grading (ASAG), but previous approaches have been technically complex, limiting their use in formative assessment contexts. The newest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially makes grading short answer questions more feasible. This paper investigates the potential for the newest version of LLMs to be used in ASAG, specifically in the grading of short answer questions for formative assessments, in two ways. First, it introduces a novel dataset of short answer reading comprehension questions, drawn from a set of reading assessments conducted with over 150 students in Ghana. This dataset allows for the evaluation of LLMs in a new context, as they are predominantly designed and trained on data from high-income North American countries. Second, the paper empirically evaluates how well various configurations of generative LLMs grade student short answer responses compared to expert human raters. The findings show that GPT-4, with minimal prompt engineering, performed extremely well on grading the novel dataset (QWK 0.92, F1 0.89), reaching near parity with expert human raters. To our knowledge this work is the first to empirically evaluate the performance of generative LLMs on short answer reading comprehension questions using real student data, with low technical hurdles to attaining this performance.

Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.

Each analytic dimension is assessed on a 6-point scale, to provide detailed feedback to students that can help them improve their science writing skills.

We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation and evaluation techniques.   Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages.   Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.   In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools' performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders.

With the advent of deep learning methods, automated GEC systems have become increasingly popular. For example, GEC systems are often used on speech transcriptions of English learners as a form of assessment and feedback - these powerful GEC systems can be used to automatically measure an aspect of a candidate's fluency. The count of \\\\textit{edits} from a candidate's input sentence (or essay) to a GEC system's grammatically corrected output sentence is indicative of a candidate's language ability, where fewer edits suggest better fluency. The count of edits can thus be viewed as a \\\\textit{fluency score} with zero implying perfect fluency. However, although deep learning based GEC systems are extremely powerful and accurate, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks: an adversary can introduce a small, specific change at the input of a system that causes a large, undesired change at the output. When considering the application of GEC systems to automated language assessment, the aim of an adversary could be to cheat by making a small change to a grammatically incorrect input sentence that conceals the errors from a GEC system, such that no edits are found and the candidate is unjustly awarded a perfect fluency score. This work examines a simple universal substitution adversarial attack that non-native speakers of English could realistically employ to deceive GEC systems used for assessment.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09466v1\", \"timestamp\": 1660931053, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent5", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"e65db9a3-2402-4abf-a9de-9eb756f29483\", \"authors\": [\"Rujun Gao\", \"Hillary E.

We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation and evaluation techniques.   Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages.   Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions.   However, these techniques' feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution.   Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness.   Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed.   In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools' performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders.   However, because the evaluation dataset is frequently unavailable, it is more difficult to reproduce results and compare tools to a collection of common assignments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11722v2\", \"timestamp\": 1687283690, \"domain\": \"cs.SE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c39820ba-417a-452e-9030-faa2063a2edf\", \"authors\": [\"Hunter McNichols\", \"Wanyong Feng\", \"Jaewook Lee\", \"Alexander Scarlatos\", \"Digory Smith\", \"Simon Woodhead\", \"Andrew Lan\"], \"title\": \"Automated Distractor and Feedback Generation for Math Multiple-choice Questions via In-context Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are ubiquitous in almost all levels of education since they are easy to administer, grade, and are a reliable form of assessment. An important aspect of MCQs is the distractors, i.e., incorrect options that are designed to target specific misconceptions or insufficient knowledge among students. To date, the task of crafting high-quality distractors has largely remained a labor-intensive process for teachers and learning content designers, which has limited scalability. In this work, we explore the task of automated distractor and corresponding feedback message generation in math MCQs using large language models. We establish a formulation of these two tasks and propose a simple, in-context learning-based solution. Moreover, we propose generative AI-based metrics for evaluating the quality of the feedback messages. We conduct extensive experiments on these tasks using a real-world MCQ dataset. Our findings suggest that there is a lot of room for improvement in automated distractor and feedback generation; based on these findings, we outline several directions for future work.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03234v2\", \"timestamp\": 1691370184, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the grading and feedback generation for formative assessments in K-12 STEM education, particularly in open-ended science questions?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the significant time burden teachers face in grading and providing feedback on formative assessments, which can hinder the learning process. By automating these tasks, we can enhance the quality and frequency of feedback students receive, thereby improving their conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. This research could lead to more efficient teaching practices, better student outcomes, and a deeper integration of technology in education, influencing future research on educational technology and assessment methodologies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the variability in student responses, which can be unstructured and diverse in vocabulary and expression. Naive approaches may fail to capture the nuances of student reasoning and understanding, leading to inaccurate assessments. Additionally, developing a reliable LLM-based system requires overcoming challenges related to prompt engineering, ensuring the model's interpretability, and maintaining alignment with educational standards and learning goals.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on more structured assessments or specific subjects, leaving a gap in automated grading for open-ended science questions. Existing solutions often lack the necessary adaptability to handle the variability in student responses effectively. Moreover, the integration of LLMs in educational contexts is still relatively new, and there has been limited exploration of their potential in formative assessment scenarios. Our approach aims to fill this gap by leveraging recent advancements in LLMs and human-in-the-loop methodologies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using GPT-4 for automated grading and feedback generation in middle school Earth Science assessments. We will employ a human-in-the-loop approach, combining few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the model's performance. The dataset will consist of real student responses to open-ended questions, and we will evaluate the model's effectiveness using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and qualitative feedback from educators.

The primary goal is to search the Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative game such that each player has no incentive to deviate from the equilibrium under its private objective. Meanwhile, the agents can coordinate to optimize the social cost within the set of Nash equilibria of the underlying game. Such an optimal Nash equilibrium problem can be modeled as a distributed optimization problem with variational inequality constraints. We consider the scenario where the objective functions of both the underlying game and social cost optimization problem have a special aggregation structure. Since each player only has access to its local objectives while cannot know all players' decisions, a distributed algorithm is highly desirable. By utilizing the Tikhonov regularization and dynamical averaging tracking technique, we propose a distributed coordination algorithm by introducing an incentive term in addition to the gradient-based Nash equilibrium seeking, so as to intervene players' decisions to improve the system efficiency.

By developing robust methods to handle these issues, we can enhance the reliability and efficiency of optimization algorithms, leading to better decision-making processes in complex systems. This research could pave the way for future studies on more intricate optimization scenarios, ultimately contributing to advancements in both theoretical and practical aspects of numerical analysis.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe primary challenges in addressing unboundedness and infeasibility stem from the complexity of the underlying mathematical structures and the potential for divergence in iterative algorithms. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricacies of embedding techniques and the need for careful selection of penalizing weights. Additionally, the presence of infinite or infinitesimal numbers complicates the analysis and convergence of solutions, requiring sophisticated mathematical tools and a deep understanding of optimization theory.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on specific classes of optimization problems without adequately addressing the general cases of unboundedness and infeasibility. Limitations in existing algorithms, such as their inability to adapt to varying problem structures or their reliance on strict feasibility conditions, have hindered progress. Our approach aims to integrate insights from recent advancements in interior-point methods and game theory, offering a more flexible framework that can adapt to a wider range of optimization challenges.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a novel methodology that combines advanced interior-point techniques with dynamic embedding strategies to tackle unbounded and infeasible optimization problems. The approach will involve the development of a new algorithm that utilizes adaptive penalizing weights and incorporates feedback mechanisms to ensure convergence. We will validate our methodology using benchmark datasets from existing literature and measure performance through metrics such as convergence speed and solution accuracy.

Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security\u00a0[27, 33] and privacy risks\u00a0[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d. Most LLMs are safety-aligned\u00a0[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks\u00a0[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\u00a0[27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered.

Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new task, knowledge-to-jailbreak, which aims to generate jailbreaks from domain knowledge to evaluate the safety of LLMs when applied to those domains.

Understanding and improving jailbreak techniques can lead to better security measures, enhancing the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world applications. This research could inform future studies on LLM defenses and contribute to the development of more robust models that can resist malicious exploitation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to navigate the intricate safety mechanisms of LLMs while crafting inputs that appear benign. Naive approaches may fail because they might trigger the model's safety filters or be too obvious, leading to detection. Additionally, the dynamic nature of LLM responses complicates the crafting of effective multi-turn interactions, requiring a deep understanding of model behavior and context management.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-turn jailbreaks or those that exploit explicit model vulnerabilities. The lack of exploration into multi-turn interactions and the use of benign inputs has left a gap in understanding how to effectively bypass safety measures without detection. Existing solutions often overlook the subtleties of conversational context and the model's response patterns, which are critical for successful multi-turn jailbreaks.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing a multi-turn interaction framework, Crescendo, that gradually guides LLMs to generate harmful content through seemingly innocuous prompts. The approach will utilize a dataset of benign and malicious prompts to train and evaluate the effectiveness of Crescendo against various LLMs, including open-source and closed-source models. Metrics for success will include the rate of successful jailbreaks and the ability to maintain the appearance of benign interactions. Expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and the development of strategies to enhance model defenses against such attacks.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

Additionally, the lack of frameworks that integrate continual learning mechanisms with temporal point processes has hindered progress. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing a hypernetwork-based framework that supports zero-shot learning and continual adaptation.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hypernetwork-based temporal point process model that incorporates mechanisms for zero-shot learning and continual learning. We will utilize real-world datasets from healthcare and social media to evaluate our model's performance. Key metrics will include prediction accuracy, generalization to unseen sequences, and the model's ability to retain knowledge from previous events. We expect our approach to demonstrate improved predictive capabilities and adaptability compared to existing models, thereby advancing the state of the art in temporal point process research.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 111178, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 2, "agent2": 2, "agent3": 2, "agent4": 4, "agent5": 4, "agent6": 4, "agent7": 2}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017; Esser et\u00a0al., 2021; Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE\u00a0(Van Den\u00a0Oord et\u00a0al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2022; Lee et\u00a0al., 2022; Sun et\u00a0al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et\u00a0al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\u00a0(Yu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\u00d7\\times\u00d7128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\u00a0(Deng et\u00a0al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods\u00a0(Chang et\u00a0al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce \u201cnext sub-token prediction\u201d to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2. We partially follow the scaling rule proposed in the previous works\u00a0(Sun et\u00a0al., 2024; Tian et\u00a0al., 2024).\n\n\n\nModel\nParameters\n\nInter-Blocks N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N\n\n\nIntra-Blocks L\ud835\udc3fLitalic_L\n\n\nWidths w\ud835\udc64witalic_w\n\n\nHeads h\u210ehitalic_h\n\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-B\n343M\n24\n2\n1024\n16\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-L\n804M\n36\n3\n1280\n20\n\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2-XL\n1.5B\n48\n4\n1536\n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Method\n\n\n2.1 Overview\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2 is composed of two significant stages. One is a powerful visual tokenizer that maps the input visual signal into the discrete token representations. Subsequently, the vector-quantized sequence will be fed into the auto-regressive transformer for intra- and inter-token relationship modeling, eventually for visual synthesis.\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of Open-MAGVIT2.

Current approaches straightforwardly convert video into language tokens and employ large language models for multi-modal tasks.

To address this problem, we propose Vista-LLaMA, a novel framework that maintains the consistent distance between all visual tokens and any language tokens, irrespective of the generated text length. Vista-LLaMA omits relative position encoding when determining attention weights between visual and text tokens, retaining the position encoding for text and text tokens. This amplifies the effect of visual tokens on text generation, especially when the relative distance is longer between visual and text tokens. The proposed attention mechanism significantly reduces the chance of producing irrelevant text related to the video content.

However, the visual modules introduces new challenges in terms of robustness for LVLMs, as attackers can craft adversarial images that are visually clean but may mislead the model to generate incorrect answers. In general, LVLMs rely on vision encoders to transform images into visual tokens, which are crucial for the language models to perceive image contents effectively. Therefore, we are curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when the encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information? To this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack (Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple perspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature representations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties of visual tokens output by image encoders. Using only access to the image encoder in the proposed attack, the generated adversarial examples exhibit transferability across diverse LVLMs utilizing the same image encoder and generality across different tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superior attack performance of the VT-Attack over baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in attacking LVLMs with image encoders, which in turn can provide guidance on the robustness of LVLMs, particularly in terms of the stability of the visual feature space.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06699v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728464816, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c257e171-60f3-4f3d-9646-0098384574fb\", \"authors\": [\"Chunjiang Ge\", \"Sijie Cheng\", \"Ziming Wang\", \"Jiale Yuan\", \"Yuan Gao\", \"Jun Song\", \"Shiji Song\", \"Gao Huang\", \"Bo Zheng\"], \"title\": \"ConvLLaVA: Hierarchical Backbones as Visual Encoder for Large Multimodal Models\", \"abstract\": \"High-resolution Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encounter the challenges of excessive visual tokens and quadratic visual complexity. Current high-resolution LMMs address the quadratic complexity while still generating excessive visual tokens. However, the redundancy in visual tokens is the key problem as it leads to more substantial compute. To mitigate this issue, we propose ConvLLaVA, which employs ConvNeXt, a hierarchical backbone, as the visual encoder of LMM to replace Vision Transformer (ViT). ConvLLaVA compresses high-resolution images into information-rich visual features, effectively preventing the generation of excessive visual tokens. To enhance the capabilities of ConvLLaVA, we propose two critical optimizations. Since the low-resolution pretrained ConvNeXt underperforms when directly applied on high resolution, we update it to bridge the gap. Moreover, since ConvNeXt's original compression ratio is inadequate for much higher resolution inputs, we train a successive stage to further compress the visual tokens, thereby reducing redundancy. These optimizations enable ConvLLaVA to support inputs of 1536x1536 resolution generating only 576 visual tokens, capable of handling images of arbitrary aspect ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on mainstream benchmarks.

However, these tokens are less discriminative as they are independent of the pre-trained tokens and fail to capture input-specific knowledge, such as class-aware textual or instance-aware visual knowledge. Leveraging the discriminative and generalization capabilities inherent in pre-trained tokens, we introduce a novel approach named Self-Enhanced Prompt Tuning (SEP). The core principle of SEP involves adapting the learnable prompt tokens at each encoder layer from the corresponding self-pretrained tokens, thereby explicitly incorporating discriminative prior knowledge to enhance both textual-level and visual-level embeddings. Furthermore, SEP's self-enhanced tokens not only boost discrimination but also mitigate domain shifts in unseen domains, enhancing generalization. In practice, SEP selects several representative tokens from all pre-trained tokens for each input data at every layer of the text/visual encoders. Subsequently, a Token Fusion Module (TFM) is introduced to generate a self-enhanced token by merging these representative tokens with the learnable tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. This self-enhanced token is then concatenated with all pre-trained tokens, serving as input for subsequent encoder layers to produce the relevant embeddings. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks and tasks confirm SEP's efficacy in prompt tuning.

There exists a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality regarding token length. In this paper, we investigate the impact of token length on both image reconstruction and generation and provide a flexible solution to the tradeoff. We propose ImageFolder, a semantic tokenizer that provides spatially aligned image tokens that can be folded during autoregressive modeling to improve both generation efficiency and quality.

Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple tokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion, enabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional next-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization strategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve the acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our proposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models, showing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual quality.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01699v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727885127, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0e3e7ed8-d698-40fc-b8be-05be4fcf9728\", \"authors\": [\"Zhuoyan Luo\", \"Fengyuan Shi\", \"Yixiao Ge\", \"Yujiu Yang\", \"Limin Wang\", \"Ying Shan\"], \"title\": \"Open-MAGVIT2: An Open-Source Project Toward Democratizing Auto-regressive Visual Generation\", \"abstract\": \"We present Open-MAGVIT2, a family of auto-regressive image generation models ranging from 300M to 1.5B.

While some attempts have been done, existing approaches typically treat them as separate tasks, failing to capture their interconnected nature. In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novel auto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and view prediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a single image and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging the gap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovative camera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of 2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in an auto-regressive manner. This unified training paradigm demonstrates that joint optimization of pose estimation and novel view synthesis leads to improved performance in both tasks, for the first time, highlighting the inherent relationship between spatial awareness and visual prediction.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18962v1\", \"timestamp\": 1729792685, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"96adac70-e7eb-49c5-a729-c38562dd5a15\", \"authors\": [\"Tianshuo Peng\", \"Zuchao Li\", \"Lefei Zhang\", \"Hai Zhao\", \"Ping Wang\", \"Bo Du\"], \"title\": \"Multi-modal Auto-regressive Modeling via Visual Words\", \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs), benefiting from the auto-regressive modelling approach performed on massive unannotated texts corpora, demonstrates powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities.

Current models often lag behind diffusion-based methods due to limitations in tokenizer performance. By addressing this issue, we can advance the state-of-the-art in visual generation, leading to more realistic and diverse image outputs. This research could pave the way for practical applications in fields such as computer graphics, virtual reality, and automated content creation, ultimately influencing future research directions in multi-modal AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent limitations of existing tokenizers, such as codebook size and reconstruction performance, which restrict the quality of generated images. Naive approaches may fail because they do not adequately address the complexities of integrating a super-large codebook with auto-regressive models. Additionally, achieving effective sub-token interaction and maintaining high generation quality while reducing computational overhead presents significant technical and theoretical obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either improving tokenizer performance or enhancing auto-regressive models separately, often overlooking the synergy between the two. The lack of access to advanced tokenizers like MAGVIT-v2 has also hindered progress. Our approach differs by proposing an open-source replication of the Lookup-Free Quantizer and integrating it with novel methods for sub-token prediction, thus addressing both tokenizer and model limitations simultaneously.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur methodology involves two main components: 1) replicating the Lookup-Free Quantizer to create a powerful visual tokenizer that maps visual signals into discrete tokens, and 2) integrating this tokenizer with an auto-regressive model using asymmetric token factorization and next sub-token prediction to enhance generation quality. We will evaluate our approach using the ImageNet dataset, measuring performance through metrics like rFID.

In contrast, data scientists typically collect as many features as possible into their datasets, and even engineer new features from existing ones. To prevent overfitting in subsequent downstream modeling, practitioners commonly use automated feature selection methods that identify a reduced subset of informative features. Existing benchmarks for tabular feature selection consider classical downstream models, toy synthetic datasets, or do not evaluate feature selectors on the basis of downstream performance. Motivated by the increasing popularity of tabular deep learning, we construct a challenging feature selection benchmark evaluated on downstream neural networks including transformers, using real datasets and multiple methods for generating extraneous features. We also propose an input-gradient-based analogue of Lasso for neural networks that outperforms classical feature selection methods on challenging problems such as selecting from corrupted or second-order features.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05877v1\", \"timestamp\": 1699593970, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c4736276-0f78-4d4f-8242-4ba22ba6b9c5\", \"authors\": [\"Xiaohan Huang\", \"Dongjie Wang\", \"Zhiyuan Ning\", \"Ziyue Qiao\", \"Qingqing Long\", \"Haowei Zhu\", \"Min Wu\", \"Yuanchun Zhou\", \"Meng Xiao\"], \"title\": \"Enhancing Tabular Data Optimization with a Flexible Graph-based Reinforced Exploration Strategy\", \"abstract\": \"Tabular data optimization methods aim to automatically find an optimal feature transformation process that generates high-value features and improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Current frameworks for automated feature transformation rely on iterative sequence generation tasks, optimizing decision strategies through performance feedback from downstream tasks. However, these approaches fail to effectively utilize historical decision-making experiences and overlook potential relationships among generated features, thus limiting the depth of knowledge extraction. Moreover, the granularity of the decision-making process lacks dynamic backtracking capabilities for individual features, leading to insufficient adaptability when encountering inefficient pathways, adversely affecting overall robustness and exploration efficiency. To address the limitations observed in current automatic feature engineering frameworks, we introduce a novel method that utilizes a feature-state transformation graph to effectively preserve the entire feature transformation journey, where each node represents a specific transformation state. During exploration, three cascading agents iteratively select nodes and idea mathematical operations to generate new transformation states. This strategy leverages the inherent properties of the graph structure, allowing for the preservation and reuse of valuable transformations. It also enables backtracking capabilities through graph pruning techniques, which can rectify inefficient transformation paths. To validate the efficacy and flexibility of our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments and detailed case studies, demonstrating superior performance in diverse scenarios.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07404v1\", \"timestamp\": 1718122237, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"05da5e13-1c9a-4fca-9d43-94debbb4b3d3\", \"authors\": [\"Meng Xiao\", \"Dongjie Wang\", \"Min Wu\", \"Ziyue Qiao\", \"Pengfei Wang\", \"Kunpeng Liu\", \"Yuanchun Zhou\", \"Yanjie Fu\"], \"title\": \"Traceable Automatic Feature Transformation via Cascading Actor-Critic Agents\", \"abstract\": \"Feature transformation for AI is an essential task to boost the effectiveness and interpretability of machine learning (ML).

To transform the way of feature selection, we regard a selected feature subset as a selection decision token sequence and reformulate feature selection as a deep sequential generative learning task that distills feature knowledge and generates decision sequences. Our method includes three steps: (1) We develop a deep variational transformer model over a joint of sequential reconstruction, variational, and performance evaluator losses. Our model can distill feature selection knowledge and learn a continuous embedding space to map feature selection decision sequences into embedding vectors associated with utility scores. (2) We leverage the trained feature subset utility evaluator as a gradient provider to guide the identification of the optimal feature subset embedding;(3) We decode the optimal feature subset embedding to autoregressively generate the best feature selection decision sequence with autostop.

A more effective feature transformation framework could lead to improved model performance, reduced reliance on domain expertise, and streamlined data preparation processes. This research could pave the way for future studies to explore more sophisticated automated methods, ultimately enhancing the interpretability and effectiveness of machine learning models in real-world applications.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of this problem arises from the high-dimensional nature of tabular data, where many features may be non-discriminative or irrelevant. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to capture intricate relationships among features or to adaptively refine the feature space based on historical performance. Additionally, the lack of dynamic backtracking capabilities in existing frameworks limits their adaptability when encountering inefficient transformation pathways, making it challenging to achieve optimal feature sets.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either empirical feature transformation methods or automated techniques that do not effectively leverage historical decision-making experiences.

Our approach differs by introducing a feature-state transformation graph that preserves the entire transformation journey, allowing for the reuse of valuable transformations and enabling backtracking to rectify inefficient paths.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a feature-state transformation graph where each node represents a specific transformation state. We will implement a cascading agent system that iteratively selects nodes and applies mathematical operations to generate new transformation states. The methodology will be validated using real datasets, such as the Housing Boston and Wine Quality datasets, and performance metrics like F1-score and 1-RAE will be employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated features.

This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness.

However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during the fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In the supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark including comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO eliminates the need for human prompting and annotation in LLM fine-tuning while achieving the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor, with less than 10% of the computational resources.

Furthermore, we give our hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk.

Our proposed TrafficSafetyGPT model and TrafficSafety-2K train dataset are accessible at https://github.com/ozheng1993/TrafficSafetyGPT.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15311v1\", \"timestamp\": 1690521431, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"972ab7d9-2834-4351-8ff5-87e302b575e0\", \"authors\": [\"Youliang Yuan\", \"Wenxiang Jiao\", \"Wenxuan Wang\", \"Jen-tse Huang\", \"Pinjia He\", \"Shuming Shi\", \"Zhaopeng Tu\"], \"title\": \"GPT-4 Is Too Smart To Be Safe: Stealthy Chat with LLMs via Cipher\", \"abstract\": \"Safety lies at the core of the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences, including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which are mainly conducted in natural languages. We propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across 11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time to bypass the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role play and several demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability. SelfCipher surprisingly outperforms existing human ciphers in almost all cases.

In this paper, we unveil a new vulnerability: the privacy backdoor attack. This black-box privacy attack aims to amplify the privacy leakage that arises when fine-tuning a model: when a victim fine-tunes a backdoored model, their training data will be leaked at a significantly higher rate than if they had fine-tuned a typical model. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and models, including both vision-language models (CLIP) and large language models, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of such an attack.

We present a privacy proof that satisfies dx-privacy where the privacy parameter epsilon provides guarantees with respect to a distance metric defined by the word embedding space. We demonstrate how epsilon can be selected by analyzing plausible deniability statistics backed up by large scale analysis on GloVe and fastText embeddings. We conduct privacy audit experiments against 2 baseline models and utility experiments on 3 datasets to demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and utility for varying values of epsilon on different task types.

In this paper, we discover that LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities, i.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness, based on the reliable MBTI-M scale. Meanwhile, the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits. According to such findings, we can edit LLMs' personality traits and improve their safety performance, e.g., inducing personality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of approximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance, respectively. Additionally, we find that LLMs with different personality traits are differentially susceptible to jailbreak.

Improving safety and helpfulness can lead to more responsible AI systems that align better with human values and ethics. This research could pave the way for future advancements in AI alignment techniques, ensuring that LLMs can be safely deployed across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent trade-offs between safety and helpfulness during the fine-tuning of LLMs. Naive approaches may fail because they often prioritize one aspect over the other, leading to models that are either overly cautious (thus less helpful) or too permissive (thus unsafe). Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated evaluation metrics that can accurately measure both safety and helpfulness, as well as the complexity of designing fine-tuning methodologies that can effectively balance these competing objectives.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either enhancing the performance of LLMs or improving their safety in isolation, often neglecting the interplay between the two. Existing solutions may lack comprehensive frameworks that address the dual objectives of safety and helpfulness simultaneously. Additionally, the reliance on human feedback in fine-tuning processes can introduce biases and inconsistencies, making it difficult to achieve a balanced outcome. Our approach aims to integrate these aspects more holistically, leveraging novel methodologies that have not been explored in depth.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a new fine-tuning framework that utilizes a dual-objective optimization strategy, balancing safety and helpfulness through a supervised learning approach. We will employ a diverse dataset that includes both safe and helpful interactions, along with metrics that evaluate performance across these dimensions. Expected outcomes include a set of refined LLMs that demonstrate improved safety and helpfulness metrics, along with a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs involved in the fine-tuning process.

A successful approach could lead to advancements in machine learning techniques, particularly in the area of few-shot learning, enabling researchers to develop more robust models that can generalize better from limited data. This could also pave the way for practical applications in real-time monitoring systems, enhancing their ability to detect and respond to anomalies promptly.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in detecting graph-level anomalies stem from the irregularity and diversity of anomalies, which complicates the learning process. Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of graph data and the potential for overfitting, especially when working with few labeled examples. Additionally, the dynamic nature of graphs introduces complexities in maintaining accurate representations over time, requiring sophisticated models that can adapt to changes in the graph structure and node attributes.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on node-level anomaly detection or has not adequately addressed the unique characteristics of graph-level anomalies. Many existing methods rely heavily on labeled data, which is often scarce and expensive to obtain. Additionally, there has been a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate both self-supervised and few-shot learning techniques to leverage limited labeled data effectively. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by proposing a meta-learning framework that adapts knowledge from self-supervised learning to enhance few-shot anomaly detection in graphs.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a two-stage framework: first, we will implement a self-supervised learning approach to pretrain models on unlabeled data, capturing normal patterns in the graph. In the second stage, we will adapt this knowledge to a few-shot learning scenario, where we will fine-tune the model using a limited number of labeled anomalies. We plan to use benchmark datasets that include both synthetic and real-world anomalies, evaluating our model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of multilingual sentence encoders is the trade-off between monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Training for cross-lingual alignment of sentence embeddings distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks. In this work, we address both issues by modular training of sentence encoders, i.e., by separating monolingual specialization from cross-lingual alignment. We first efficiently train language-specific sentence encoders to avoid negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English monolingual encoders to the English encoder by training a cross-lingual alignment adapter on top of each, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. In both steps, we resort to contrastive learning on machine-translated paraphrase data. Monolingual and cross-lingual evaluations on semantic text similarity/relatedness and multiple-choice QA render our modular solution more effective than multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14878v1\", \"timestamp\": 1721483799, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"770be719-345f-4faf-9228-18967b10dac1\", \"authors\": [\"Hanan Aldarmaki\", \"Mona Diab\"], \"title\": \"Context-Aware Cross-Lingual Mapping\", \"abstract\": \"Cross-lingual word vectors are typically obtained by fitting an orthogonal matrix that maps the entries of a bilingual dictionary from a source to a target vector space.

We incorporate context in the transformation matrix by directly mapping the averaged embeddings of aligned sentences in a parallel corpus. We also implement cross-lingual mapping of deep contextualized word embeddings using parallel sentences with word alignments.

A successful approach could lead to more effective multilingual applications such as document retrieval, question answering, and machine translation, thereby broadening access to information across language barriers. This research could also inspire future studies on unsupervised learning techniques and their applications in cross-lingual settings, potentially leading to significant advancements in the field.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of aligning sentence embeddings from different languages without relying on extensive parallel datasets. Naive approaches may fail due to the diverse linguistic structures and semantics across languages, which can lead to misalignment in the embedding space. Additionally, achieving a balance between monolingual accuracy and cross-lingual alignment is technically demanding, as it requires sophisticated models that can generalize well across languages while preserving the nuances of each language's semantics.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on supervised methods that require large amounts of parallel data, which is often unavailable for many languages. Existing solutions tend to either sacrifice monolingual performance for cross-lingual alignment or vice versa. Our approach aims to address these limitations by leveraging contrastive learning techniques on English data to create universal embeddings, thus reducing the dependency on parallel datasets and improving the overall performance of multilingual sentence embeddings.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a methodology that extends the SimCSE framework to a multilingual context (mSimCSE) by utilizing contrastive learning on English data to generate high-quality universal cross-lingual sentence embeddings. The dataset will include English Wikipedia and NLI training tuples, with performance metrics focusing on cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks.

Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot address the main space and computational bottleneck in GNNs, caused by the size and connectivity of the graph. To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification (UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale graphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular lottery ticket hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph lottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core sub-dataset and sparse sub-network, which can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full dense graph by iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural networks, GLT can be trained in isolation to match the performance of training with the full model and graph, and can be drawn from both randomly initialized and self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been experimentally verified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Specifically, for node classification, our found GLTs achieve the same accuracies with 20%~98% MACs saving on small graphs and 25%~85% MACs saving on large ones.

While end-to-end jointly optimizing GNNs and their accelerators is promising in boosting GNNs' inference efficiency and expediting the design process, it is still underexplored due to the vast and distinct design spaces of GNNs and their accelerators. In this work, we propose G-CoS, a GNN and accelerator co-search framework that can automatically search for matched GNN structures and accelerators to maximize both task accuracy and acceleration efficiency. Specifically, GCoS integrates two major enabling components: (1) a generic GNN accelerator search space which is applicable to various GNN structures and (2) a one-shot GNN and accelerator co-search algorithm that enables simultaneous and efficient search for optimal GNN structures and their matched accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, G-CoS is the first co-search framework for GNNs and their accelerators. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that the GNNs and accelerators generated by G-CoS consistently outperform SOTA GNNs and GNN accelerators in terms of both task accuracy and hardware efficiency, while only requiring a few hours for the end-to-end generation of the best matched GNNs and their accelerators.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08983v1\", \"timestamp\": 1631990164, \"domain\": \"cs.AR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b6854d2a-f20b-4b7e-8163-f7300cdeb2d6\", \"authors\": [\"Zhili Wang\", \"Shimin Di\", \"Lei Chen\", \"Xiaofang Zhou\"], \"title\": \"Search to Fine-tune Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Tasks\", \"abstract\": \"Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown its unprecedented success in many graph-related tasks. However, GNNs face the label scarcity issue as other neural networks do. Thus, recent efforts try to pre-train GNNs on a large-scale unlabeled graph and adapt the knowledge from the unlabeled graph to the target downstream task. The adaptation is generally achieved by fine-tuning the pre-trained GNNs with a limited number of labeled data. Despite the importance of fine-tuning, current GNNs pre-training works often ignore designing a good fine-tuning strategy to better leverage transferred knowledge and improve the performance on downstream tasks. Only few works start to investigate a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs. But their designs either have strong assumptions or overlook the data-aware issue for various downstream datasets. Therefore, we aim to design a better fine-tuning strategy for pre-trained GNNs to improve the model performance in this paper. Given a pre-trained GNN, we propose to search to fine-tune pre-trained graph neural networks for graph-level tasks (S2PGNN), which adaptively design a suitable fine-tuning framework for the given labeled data on the downstream task. To ensure the improvement brought by searching fine-tuning strategy, we carefully summarize a proper search space of fine-tuning framework that is suitable for GNNs. The empirical studies show that S2PGNN can be implemented on the top of 10 famous pre-trained GNNs and consistently improve their performance. Besides, S2PGNN achieves better performance than existing fine-tuning strategies within and outside the GNN area.

A comprehensive dataset will facilitate systematic evaluations of GNN architectures and their scalability, leading to improved performance in real-world applications such as fraud detection, recommendation systems, and molecular structure prediction. This research could also inspire new methodologies in data generation and labeling, ultimately enhancing the field of machine learning.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges include the difficulty in obtaining large-scale labeled datasets due to proprietary data restrictions and the inherent complexity of graph structures. Existing datasets often lack sufficient labeled data, which hampers the training of GNNs and makes it hard to discern whether low model accuracy is due to insufficient data or model limitations. Additionally, creating a dataset that maintains consistent homophily across varying graph sizes and supports diverse multi-class classification tasks adds to the complexity.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on small datasets or specific applications, leading to a lack of comprehensive datasets that cater to the diverse needs of GNN research. Existing datasets like OGBN and MAG provide limited labeled data, which restricts their utility for supervised learning tasks. Moreover, the absence of flexible datasets that allow for systematic evaluation of GNN models has hindered progress. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by providing a dataset that is not only large and labeled but also adaptable for various research needs.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose the Illinois Graph Benchmark (IGB), a dataset that includes both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs with a wide range of labeled data. The methodology involves collecting and curating diverse graph structures, ensuring a balance of labeled and unlabeled data, and implementing various embedding generation techniques. We will evaluate the dataset's effectiveness by measuring GNN performance across multiple tasks and graph sizes, using metrics such as accuracy, execution efficiency, and generalization capability.

By improving trainability, we can unlock the potential of QML to accelerate data analysis in various fields such as quantum materials, biochemistry, and high-energy physics. This research could lead to significant advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications, paving the way for more robust QML algorithms that can be implemented in real-world scenarios.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing the trainability of QML models stem from the inherent noise and errors present in NISQ devices, which complicate the optimization processes typically used in machine learning. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the unique characteristics of quantum data and the limitations of quantum hardware. Additionally, the theoretical frameworks for understanding the dynamics of QML are still developing, making it difficult to establish effective training methodologies that can adapt to the quantum environment.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on developing quantum algorithms without adequately addressing the specific challenges posed by NISQ devices, such as noise and limited qubit connectivity. Many existing solutions lack a comprehensive approach that integrates noise mitigation techniques with model training. Our approach will differ by combining advanced noise reduction strategies with innovative training algorithms tailored for quantum environments, thus providing a more holistic solution to the problem.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology will involve the development of a hybrid training framework that integrates classical optimization techniques with quantum error mitigation strategies. We will utilize a dataset of quantum states generated from NISQ devices and apply metrics such as accuracy and robustness to evaluate model performance.

TimeSeriesExam comprises of over 700 questions, procedurally generated using 104 carefully curated templates and iteratively refined to balance difficulty and their ability to discriminate good from bad models. We test 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on the TimeSeriesExam and provide the first comprehensive evaluation of their time series understanding abilities. Our results suggest that closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini understand simple time series concepts significantly better than their open-source counterparts, while all models struggle with complex concepts such as causality analysis. We believe that the ability to programatically generate questions is fundamental to assessing and improving LLM's ability to understand and reason about time series data.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14752v1\", \"timestamp\": 1729219034, \"domain\": \"cs.AI\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively model and forecast multivariate time series data by capturing varying inter-series correlations across different time scales?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for advancing the field of time series analysis, as it addresses the complex dependencies that exist in multivariate datasets across various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental science. A successful approach could lead to more accurate forecasting models, which would enhance decision-making processes in these fields. Furthermore, this research could pave the way for future studies on adaptive modeling techniques that leverage multi-scale correlations, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust machine learning frameworks.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the intricate nature of inter-series correlations that can vary significantly across different time scales. Naive approaches may fail to capture these dynamics due to their inability to adapt to the multi-scale nature of the data. Additionally, the complexity of designing models that can effectively learn and represent these correlations, while also maintaining computational efficiency, poses significant technical and theoretical obstacles. The need for advanced techniques, such as frequency domain analysis and adaptive graph convolution, adds to the complexity of the problem.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on either intra-series dependencies or has treated inter-series correlations uniformly, neglecting the varying nature of these relationships across time scales. Existing models may lack the flexibility to adapt to different correlation structures, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the computational demands of more sophisticated models have limited their practical application. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by introducing a model that explicitly captures multi-scale inter-series correlations through innovative techniques, thus improving upon prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a deep learning model, MSGNet, which utilizes frequency domain analysis to decompose time series data into distinct time scales. The model will incorporate an adaptive mixhop graph convolution layer to learn diverse inter-series correlations and a self-attention mechanism to capture intra-series dependencies. We will evaluate the model using real-world datasets, measuring performance through metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Improved data augmentation techniques can lead to better generalization of classifiers, which is essential for real-world applications across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. A paper addressing this question could pave the way for future research on automated augmentation methods, potentially leading to more robust models that require less manual tuning and can adapt to new datasets more efficiently.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to balance effective data augmentation with the preservation of label integrity. Naive approaches may fail because they could introduce noise or mislabel data, leading to degraded model performance.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, access to molecular forces has become an essential aspect in various applications such as geometry optimization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\u00a0(Jensen, 2010).\nHowever, the underlying quantum mechanical (QM) calculations required for these predictions are computationally demanding.\nIn order to reduce this computational burden, graph neural networks (GNNs) fitted to QM data have been proposed as a means to accelerate MD simulations\u00a0(Chmiela et\u00a0al., 2017; Sch\u00fctt et\u00a0al., 2018).\nWhile such surrogates have recently achieved exceptional reproduction of the dataset they have been trained on, they tend to perform poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) data (Li et\u00a0al., 2022). In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains.

Here, we performed a theoretical analysis to tackle this question. We show that in general AM-AFM measurements, the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope whereas the conventional equation is only valid for excitation exactly at the resonance frequency. We then derive a force conversion equation for an arbitrary excitation frequency and found that the conventional equation overestimates the actual force by about five times.

The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains.

However, when IFCs are applied on uncertain bimolecular (and hence most intracellular) networks, we show that preventing NECs generally becomes an intractable problem as the number of interacting molecular species increases.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10668v3\", \"timestamp\": 1613935723, \"domain\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"ccf1bae4-6ab9-491e-9cff-ed1d692b6f63\", \"authors\": [\"Seongok Ryu\", \"Yongchan Kwon\", \"Woo Youn Kim\"], \"title\": \"Uncertainty quantification of molecular property prediction using Bayesian neural network models\", \"abstract\": \"In chemistry, deep neural network models have been increasingly utilized in a variety of applications such as molecular property predictions, novel molecule designs, and planning chemical reactions. Despite the rapid increase in the use of state-of-the-art models and algorithms, deep neural network models often produce poor predictions in real applications because model performance is highly dependent on the quality of training data. In the field of molecular analysis, data are mostly obtained from either complicated chemical experiments or approximate mathematical equations, and then quality of data may be questioned.In this paper, we quantify uncertainties of prediction using Bayesian neural networks in molecular property predictions. We estimate both model-driven and data-driven uncertainties, demonstrating the usefulness of uncertainty quantification as both a quality checker and a confidence indicator with the three experiments.

Herein, we consider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end, introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular alignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole force. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the optical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole force, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could be based. We note that an analogous analysis of the forces acting on polar molecules subject to an inhomogeneous static electric field reveals a similarly strong dependence on molecular orientation.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00516v1\", \"timestamp\": 1464830262, \"domain\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"555366cd-67cf-4a2b-8913-31858c2a6931\", \"authors\": [\"Narendra Nath Patra\"], \"title\": \"Molecular scale height in spiral galaxies\", \"abstract\": \"Having to have low thermal energy, the molecular gas in galaxies is expected to settle in a thin disc near the midplane. However, contradicting this understanding, recent studies have revealed considerably thick molecular discs in nearby spiral galaxies. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we theoretically model the molecular discs in a sample of eight nearby spiral galaxies and estimate their molecular scale heights (Half Width at Half Maxima (HWHM)). We assume that the baryonic discs are in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under their mutual gravity in the external force field of the dark matter halo. We set up the joint Poisson's-Boltzman equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and numerically solve it to obtain the three-dimensional molecular gas distribution and determine the scale heights in our sample galaxies. We find that the scale heights follow a universal exponential law with a scale length of $0.46 \\\\pm 0.01 \\\\ r_{25}$. The molecular scale heights in our sample galaxies are found to vary between 50-200 pc depending on the galaxy and radius. Using the density solutions, we build dynamical models of the molecular discs and produce molecular column density maps. These model maps found to match to the observed ones reasonably well. We further incline the dynamical models to an inclination of 90$^o$ to estimate the expected observed thickness of the molecular discs. Interestingly it is found that at edge-on orientation, our sample galaxies under hydrostatic assumption can easily produce a few kpc thick observable molecular disc.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13053v1\", \"timestamp\": 1588010413, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"82a1fc92-4251-4abc-bbb8-b21db430402c\", \"authors\": [\"Dvira Segal\", \"Abraham Nitzan\", \"Peter Hanggi\"], \"title\": \"Thermal conductance through molecular wires\", \"abstract\": \"We consider phononic heat transport through molecular chains connecting two thermal reservoirs. For relatively short molecules at normal temperatures heat conduction is dominated by the harmonic part of the molecular force-field. We develop a general theory for the heat conduction through harmonic chains in 3-dimensions. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement with other recent studies. We use this formalism to study the heat conduction properties of alkanes. For relatively short (1-30 carbon atoms) chains the length and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction result from the balance of three factors: (i) The molecular frequency spectrum in relation to the frequency cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate dependence of the heat conduction on molecular length at different temperatures. For example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains at low temperatures. Similar considerations apply for isotopically substituted disordered chains. Finally, we compare the heat conduction obtained from this microscopic calculation to that estimated by considering the molecule as a cylinder characterized by a macroscopic heat conduction typical to organic solids. We find that this classical model overestimates the heat conduction of single alkane molecules by about an order of magnitude at room temperature.

Here, we performed a theoretical analysis to tackle this question. We show that in general AM-AFM measurements, the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope whereas the conventional equation is only valid for excitation exactly at the resonance frequency.

By addressing this problem, we can enhance the predictive power of machine learning models, leading to more accurate simulations and better decision-making in practical applications. This research could pave the way for advancements in understanding molecular interactions and dynamics, ultimately impacting the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of molecular systems and the limitations of existing models, which often fail to generalize to unseen data. Naive approaches may overlook the nuances of molecular interactions and the need for robust uncertainty quantification methods. Additionally, the integration of uncertainty estimation into existing frameworks without compromising predictive performance poses significant technical and theoretical obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on improving predictive accuracy without adequately addressing uncertainty quantification. Existing methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of uncertainties, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

On the\none hand, numerous old problems have been revisited with\ndeep neural networks and huge progress has been made in\nmany tasks previously seemed out of reach, such as machine\ntranslation and computer vision. On the other hand, new\ntechniques such as geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al.\n2017) are being developed to generalize deep neural models\nto new or non-traditional domains.\nIt is well known that training a deep neural model typi-\ncally requires a large amount of labeled data, which cannot\nbe satis\ufb01ed in many scenarios due to the high cost of labeling\ntraining data. To reduce the amount of data needed for train-\ning, a recent surge of research interest has focused on few-\nshot learning (Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum 2015;\nRezende et al. 2016) \u2013 to learn a classi\ufb01cation model with\nvery few examples from each class. Closely related to few-\nshot learning is semi-supervised learning, where a large\n\u0003Corresponding author.\nCopyright c\r2018, Association for the Advancement of Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

The key issue is\nto maximize the effective utilization of structural and fea-\nture information of unlabeled data. Due to the powerful fea-\nture extraction capability and recent success of deep neu-\nral networks, there have been some successful attempts to\nrevisit semi-supervised learning with neural-network-based\nmodels, including ladder network (Rasmus et al. 2015),\nsemi-supervised embedding (Weston et al. 2008), planetoid\n(Yang, Cohen, and Salakhutdinov 2016), and graph convo-\nlutional networks (Kipf and Welling 2017).\nThe recently developed graph convolutional neural net-\nworks (GCNNs) (Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst\n2016) is a successful attempt of generalizing the power-\nful convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in dealing with\nEuclidean data to modeling graph-structured data. In their\npilot work (Kipf and Welling 2017), Kipf and Welling pro-\nposed a simpli\ufb01ed type of GCNNs, called graph convolu-\ntional networks (GCNs), and applied it to semi-supervised\nclassi\ufb01cation. The GCN model naturally integrates the con-\nnectivity patterns and feature attributes of graph-structured\ndata, and outperforms many state-of-the-art results of other baselines are\ncopied from (Kipf and Welling 2017).

This paper con-\ntributes to the understanding of the GCN model and its appli-\ncation in semi-supervised classi\ufb01cation. Our analysis not\nonly reveals the mechanisms and limitations of the GCN\nmodel, but also leads to new solutions overcoming its limits.\nIn future work, we plan to develop new convolutional \ufb01lters\nwhich are compatible with deep architectures, and exploit\nadvanced deep learning techniques to improve the perfor-\nmance of GCNs for more graph-based applications.

GraphHeat achieves state-of-the-art results in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification across three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16002v1\", \"timestamp\": 1595850832, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we develop a more effective graph convolutional network (GCN) that dynamically learns optimal graph structures for semi-supervised learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses the limitations of existing GCNs that rely on fixed graph structures, which may not be optimal for all datasets. By improving the adaptability of GCNs, this research could significantly enhance the performance of semi-supervised learning across various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. This work could pave the way for future research into more flexible and efficient learning algorithms that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data effectively.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of dynamically learning graph structures that accurately represent the underlying data relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. Naive approaches may fail due to the high dimensionality of graph data and the need for real-time adaptability. Additionally, there are theoretical obstacles in ensuring that the learned graph structures generalize well to unseen data, as well as practical issues related to the scalability of the proposed methods to large datasets.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on static graph structures, which limits their applicability in diverse scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to balance the trade-off between model complexity and performance, leading to suboptimal results. Additionally, the lack of effective frameworks that integrate graph learning with convolutional operations has hindered progress. Our approach aims to unify these aspects, allowing for simultaneous graph structure learning and feature extraction, thus overcoming the limitations of prior work.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a novel Adaptive Neighborhood Graph Propagation Network (ANGPN) that integrates graph learning and convolutional operations in a unified framework. The methodology involves constructing an optimal neighborhood graph based on both labeled and unlabeled data, using a combination of graph filtering techniques and adaptive feature propagation. We will evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed, using metrics like classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in semi-supervised learning performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our adaptive graph learning strategy.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 53485, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 5}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

While recent advancements in text-to-avatar generation have yielded diverse human avatars from text prompts, these methods typically combine all elements-clothes, hair, and body-into a single 3D representation. Such an entangled approach poses challenges for downstream tasks like editing or animation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel disentangled 3D avatar representation named Sequentially Offset-SMPL (SO-SMPL), building upon the SMPL model. SO-SMPL represents the human body and clothes with two separate meshes but associates them with offsets to ensure the physical alignment between the body and the clothes. Then, we design a Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based distillation framework to generate the proposed SO-SMPL representation from text prompts. Our approach not only achieves higher texture and geometry quality and better semantic alignment with text prompts, but also significantly improves the visual quality of character animation, virtual try-on, and avatar editing.

Text2Avatar leverages a discrete codebook as an intermediate feature to establish a connection between text and avatars, enabling the disentanglement of features. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of realistic style 3D human avatar data, we utilize a pre-trained unconditional 3D human avatar generation model to obtain a large amount of 3D avatar pseudo data, which allows Text2Avatar to achieve realistic style generation.

To address these limitations, we propose AvatarStudio, a coarse-to-fine generative model that generates explicit textured 3D meshes for animatable human avatars. Specifically, AvatarStudio begins with a low-resolution NeRF-based representation for coarse generation, followed by incorporating SMPL-guided articulation into the explicit mesh representation to support avatar animation and high resolution rendering. To ensure view consistency and pose controllability of the resulting avatars, we introduce a 2D diffusion model conditioned on DensePose for Score Distillation Sampling supervision. By effectively leveraging the synergy between the articulated mesh representation and the DensePose-conditional diffusion model, AvatarStudio can create high-quality avatars from text that are ready for animation, significantly outperforming previous methods.

In this work, we propose ParDy-Human (Parameterized Dynamic Human Avatar), a fully explicit approach to construct a digital avatar from as little as a single monocular sequence. ParDy-Human introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method is composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians according to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their designed joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with dynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a rasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic human avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our avatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be trained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images efficiently even on consumer hardware.

Black\"], \"title\": \"ICON: Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\", \"abstract\": \"Current methods for learning realistic and animatable 3D clothed avatars need either posed 3D scans or 2D images with carefully controlled user poses. In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\\\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\\\"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from in-the-wild images.

Secondly, CLIP only provides optimization direction for the overall appearance, resulting in less impressive results. To address these limitations, we propose AvatarFusion, the first framework to use a latent diffusion model to provide pixel-level guidance for generating human-realistic avatars while simultaneously segmenting clothing from the avatar's body. AvatarFusion includes the first clothing-decoupled neural implicit avatar model that employs a novel Dual Volume Rendering strategy to render the decoupled skin and clothing sub-models in one space.

Our key contribution is the precise avatar generation control by using dual fine-tuned diffusion models separately for the human face and body.

A user-friendly method is proposed to automatically generate triplets for a system allowing users to easily and efficiently annotate the correspondences.

We design ExAvatar as a combination of the whole-body parametric mesh model (SMPL-X) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The main challenges are 1) a limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD images. The limited diversity in the video makes animations with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial. In addition, the absence of 3D observations could cause significant ambiguity in human parts that are not observed in the video, which can result in noticeable artifacts under novel motions. To address them, we introduce our hybrid representation of the mesh and 3D Gaussians. Our hybrid representation treats each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface with pre-defined connectivity information (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology of SMPL-X.

ParDy-Human introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar.

In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\\\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\\\"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping.

Additionally, the absence of 3D observations, such as scans or depth data, introduces ambiguities in occluded body parts, leading to artifacts in the generated avatars. Naive approaches may fail due to their inability to handle these complexities, as they often rely on extensive training data or controlled environments that are not representative of real-world scenarios.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either static avatar generation or required extensive 3D data, which is impractical for everyday video inputs.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28]. However, the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

In addition, we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real environments.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09133v1\", \"timestamp\": 1540196459, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve the detection of anomalous sounds in industrial machinery using unsupervised learning techniques that account for the variability in normal sound distributions across different machines?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for enhancing predictive maintenance in industrial settings, which can lead to reduced downtime and maintenance costs. By improving anomalous sound detection, we can advance the field of machine learning in acoustic signal processing, leading to more robust systems that can operate effectively in diverse environments. This research could pave the way for more automated monitoring systems, ultimately contributing to the development of smart factories and Industry 4.0.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the high variability of normal sounds across different machines, which can obscure the distinction between normal and anomalous sounds. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for this variability, leading to high false positive rates. Additionally, the lack of labeled anomalous sound data makes it difficult to train effective supervised models, necessitating the development of sophisticated unsupervised methods that can generalize well across different operational contexts.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on supervised learning methods that require extensive labeled datasets, which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised methods may not adequately address the variability in normal sound distributions, leading to poor detection performance. Our approach aims to integrate machine identity information into the anomaly detection process, allowing for tailored models that can better differentiate between normal and anomalous sounds across different machines.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a novel unsupervised learning framework that incorporates machine identity as a condition in the latent feature space of an autoencoder. This method will utilize a diverse dataset of normal sounds from various machines to train the model, focusing on minimizing reconstruction errors while maximizing the distinction between normal and anomalous sounds. We will evaluate our approach using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) and false positive rates on benchmark datasets like DCASE2021. The expected outcome is a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance, particularly in environments with high variability in normal sound profiles.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 50310, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 5, "agent2": 5, "agent3": 3}, "total_milestones": 5, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022).

The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures.

Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

For example, if word embeddings of similar words contain similar values, word similarity can be readily assessed, whereas judging that from their spelling is often impossible (e.g. cat /feline) and to predetermine and store similarities between all words is prohibitively time-consuming, memory intensive and subjective. We focus on word embeddings learned from text corpora and knowledge graphs. Several well-known algorithms learn word embeddings from text on an unsupervised basis by learning to predict those words that occur around each word, e.g. word2vec and GloVe. Parameters of such word embeddings are known to reflect word co-occurrence statistics, but how they capture semantic meaning has been unclear. Knowledge graph representation models learn representations both of entities (words, people, places, etc.) and relations between them, typically by training a model to predict known facts in a supervised manner. Despite steady improvements in fact prediction accuracy, little is understood of the latent structure that enables this.   The limited understanding of how latent semantic structure is encoded in the geometry of word embeddings and knowledge graph representations makes a principled means of improving their performance, reliability or interpretability unclear. To address this:   1. we theoretically justify the empirical observation that particular geometric relationships between word embeddings learned by algorithms such as word2vec and GloVe correspond to semantic relations between words; and   2. we extend this correspondence between semantics and geometry to the entities and relations of knowledge graphs, providing a model for the latent structure of knowledge graph representation linked to that of word embeddings.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00486v1\", \"timestamp\": 1643729698, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c6d67380-0ff2-4e3e-a35d-b47dc2631554\", \"authors\": [\"Rajat Patel\", \"Francis Ferraro\"], \"title\": \"On the Complementary Nature of Knowledge Graph Embedding, Fine Grain Entity Types, and Language Modeling\", \"abstract\": \"We demonstrate the complementary natures of neural knowledge graph embedding, fine-grain entity type prediction, and neural language modeling.

To handle heterogeneous relations in KGs, we introduce a novel way of representing heterogeneous neighborhood by introducing transformation assumptions on the relationship between the subject, the relation, and the object of a triple. Specifically, a relation is treated as a transformation operator transforming a head entity to a tail entity. Both translation assumption in TransE and rotation assumption in RotatE are explored in our framework. Additionally, instead of only learning entity embeddings in the convolution-based encoder while learning relation embeddings in the decoder as done by the state-of-art models, e.g., R-GCN, the TransGCN framework trains relation embeddings and entity embeddings simultaneously during the graph convolution operation, thus having fewer parameters compared with R-GCN.

Nonetheless, the high costs associated with training and deploying LLMs present substantial obstacles to transparent, accessible academic research. While several large language models, such as LLaMA, have been open-sourced by the community, these predominantly focus on English corpora, limiting their usefulness for other languages. In this paper, we propose a method to augment LLaMA with capabilities for understanding and generating Chinese text and its ability to follow instructions. We achieve this by extending LLaMA's existing vocabulary with an additional 20,000 Chinese tokens, thereby improving its encoding efficiency and semantic understanding of Chinese. We further incorporate secondary pre-training using Chinese data and fine-tune the model with Chinese instruction datasets, significantly enhancing the model's ability to comprehend and execute instructions. Our experimental results indicate that the newly proposed model markedly enhances the original LLaMA's proficiency in understanding and generating Chinese content. Additionally, the results on the C-Eval dataset yield competitive performance among the models with several times the size of ours.

This research could lead to more robust AI systems that perform well in real-world scenarios, where data distributions can vary significantly. By addressing this problem, we can advance the understanding of model architectures and training methodologies, potentially leading to breakthroughs in AI applications such as translation, content generation, and cross-modal understanding.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing model complexity with efficiency. As models grow in size and capability, they often require exponentially more data and computational resources, which can lead to diminishing returns in performance. Naive approaches, such as simply increasing model size or training data, may not yield better generalization and can result in overfitting or increased inference costs. Additionally, the integration of diverse data types (text, images, etc.) introduces complexities in training and evaluation, necessitating sophisticated methodologies to ensure effective learning.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on optimizing models for specific tasks or modalities, leading to a lack of comprehensive approaches that address the interplay between different types of data and tasks. Limitations in computational resources and the availability of diverse datasets have also hindered progress. Many existing models are designed with a one-size-fits-all mentality, which does not account for the unique challenges posed by multilingual and multimodal contexts. Our approach aims to integrate insights from recent advancements in model architectures and training techniques to create a more unified framework.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose a hybrid training methodology that combines diffusion sampling techniques with adaptive fine-tuning strategies to enhance model generalization. The methodology will involve training on a diverse dataset that includes multilingual text and multimodal inputs, utilizing metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and generalization error to evaluate performance. Expected outcomes include improved model performance across various tasks, demonstrating the ability to generalize effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.

Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores.

We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of age stereotypes as a voice disguise strategy, as a follow up to our recent work where 60 native Finnish speakers attempted to sound like an elderly and like a child. In that study, we presented evidence that both ASV and human observers could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable the presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The interesting cases would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV system, and which a typical listener cannot detect as being a disguise. We carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) crowd-workers.

In addition to the targeted information, these representations usually contain sensitive information about the speaker, like the age, sex, physical state, education level or ethnicity. In order to allow the user to choose which information to protect, we introduce in this paper the concept of attribute-driven privacy preservation in speaker voice representation. It allows a person to hide one or more personal aspects to a potential malicious interceptor and to the application provider.

However, there is little research on cross-age speaker verification (CASV) due to insufficient relevant data. In this paper, we mine cross-age test sets based on the VoxCeleb dataset and propose our age-invariant speaker representation(AISR) learning method. Since the VoxCeleb is collected from the YouTube platform, the dataset consists of cross-age data inherently. However, the meta-data does not contain the speaker age label. Therefore, we adopt the face age estimation method to predict the speaker age value from the associated visual data, then label the audio recording with the estimated age. We construct multiple Cross-Age test sets on VoxCeleb (Vox-CA), which deliberately select the positive trials with large age-gap. Also, the effect of nationality and gender is considered in selecting negative pairs to align with Vox-H cases. The baseline system performance drops from 1.939\\\\% EER on the Vox-H test set to 10.419\\\\% on the Vox-CA20 test set, which indicates how difficult the cross-age scenario is. Consequently, we propose an age-decoupling adversarial learning (ADAL) method to alleviate the negative effect of the age gap and reduce intra-class variance. Our method outperforms the baseline system by over 10\\\\% related EER reduction on the Vox-CA20 test set.

This research could lead to advancements in speaker recognition technology, enabling systems to better handle variations in voice due to aging. It may also inform the development of more robust models that can adapt to changes in speaker characteristics over time, thus enhancing user experience and trust in voice-based systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complex interplay between aging effects and the variability in voice characteristics across different languages and genders. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the nuanced ways in which aging impacts voice features, which can vary significantly between individuals. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive datasets that capture a wide range of ages and conditions complicates the modeling process, making it difficult to generalize findings across diverse populations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on single languages or limited datasets, neglecting the broader implications of aging across different demographics. There has been a lack of comprehensive studies that analyze the aging effect in a multi-lingual and gender-diverse context. Additionally, existing models may not adequately address the variability introduced by aging, leading to gaps in understanding how to effectively mitigate these effects in ASV systems.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves using linear mixed effect (LME) models to analyze ASV scores across different age groups, genders, and languages using datasets like VoxCeleb and LCFSH. The study will focus on the relationship between age differences in enrollment and verification recordings and their impact on ASV performance. Metrics such as Equal Error Rate (EER) will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the models. Expected outcomes include a clearer understanding of how aging affects ASV systems and the development of strategies to improve their robustness against age-related variations in voice.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 4], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 109368, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 6, "agent3": 6, "agent4": 6, "agent5": 3, "agent6": 5}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 4, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies.

By leveraging LLMs, this research could lead to more robust and accurate graph representations, enhancing various downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. This advancement could significantly impact the fields of social network analysis, recommender systems, and any domain that utilizes graph-structured data, paving the way for future research on integrating LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs).\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to effectively integrate LLMs with GNNs while ensuring that the model can accurately discern relevant information from potentially noisy or incomplete graph structures. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate dependencies within graphs that are not easily captured by standard learning techniques. Additionally, the challenge lies in developing a methodology that can adaptively learn from the rich textual data associated with nodes while maintaining the integrity of the graph structure, which requires overcoming technical hurdles related to data representation and model training.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on explicit graph structures and often overlooked the potential of LLMs in refining these structures. Limitations include a lack of methodologies that effectively combine textual data with graph learning and the challenges of dealing with data noise and sparsity. Existing solutions may not adequately address the dynamic nature of graph structures or the implicit relationships between nodes. Our approach aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel model that integrates LLMs with GNNs, focusing on refining graph structures through a dual objective of noise reduction and dependency discovery.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves developing a model called GraphEdit, which will utilize LLMs to analyze the textual data associated with graph nodes. The model will be trained on datasets that include social networks and recommender systems, focusing on metrics such as accuracy in node classification and the quality of graph structure refinement. Expected outcomes include improved identification of relevant connections and enhanced understanding of node-wise dependencies, leading to more accurate graph representations and better performance in downstream tasks.

The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\u00a0al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et\u00a0al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\u00a0al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\u00a0al., 2021, Brown et\u00a0al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et\u00a0al., 2019, Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\u00a0al., 2015].

However, the model-based approach for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres relies on Solar System data, resulting in our limited inventory being both foundational and critical atmospheric laboratories.

We find that precipitation is weaker when atmospheric mass is larger for a given surface temperature. Furthermore, the increasing rate of precipitation with increasing surface temperature under a larger atmospheric mass is smaller than that under a smaller atmospheric mass.

Many rocky exoplanets are born with thick (> 10 kbar) H$_2$-dominated atmospheres but subsequently lose their H$_2$; this process has no known Solar System analog. We study the consequences of early loss of a thick H$_2$ atmosphere for subsequent occurrence of a high-molecular-weight atmosphere using a simple model of atmosphere evolution (including atmosphere loss to space, magma ocean crystallization, and volcanic outgassing). We also calculate atmosphere survival for rocky worlds that start with no H$_2$. Our results imply that most rocky exoplanets orbiting closer to their star than the Habitable Zone that were formed with thick H$_2$-dominated atmospheres lack high-molecular-weight atmospheres today. During early magma ocean crystallization, high-molecular-weight species usually do not form long-lived high-molecular-weight atmospheres; instead they are lost to space alongside H$_2$. This early volatile depletion also makes it more difficult for later volcanic outgassing to revive the atmosphere. However, atmospheres should persist on worlds that start with abundant volatiles (for example, waterworlds). Our results imply that in order to find high-molecular-weight atmospheres on warm exoplanets orbiting M-stars, we should target worlds that formed H$_2$-poor, that have anomalously large radii, or which orbit less active stars.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02589v2\", \"timestamp\": 1591228647, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent2", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"8fd873fc-d4ad-4366-8d46-9a6e49916639\", \"authors\": [\"Lujia Zhang\", \"Hanzhe Cui\", \"Yurong Song\", \"Chenyue Li\", \"Binhang Yuan\", \"Mengqian Lu\"], \"title\": \"On the Opportunities of (Re)-Exploring Atmospheric Science by Foundation Models: A Case Study\", \"abstract\": \"Most state-of-the-art AI applications in atmospheric science are based on classic deep learning approaches.

It is particularly\nneeded where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\nversary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop arti\ufb01cial intelli-\ngence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\nrobotics, ACO is affected by the \u2018reality gap\u2019 [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021 ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could be critical to an agent\u2019s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\nwhich is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment, precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the \u2018reality gap\u2019, used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\nin a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated systems. Successful agents are trans-\nferred to the real system to \ufb01rstly validate their effectiveness,\nand secondly to re\ufb01ne the simulation.\nWe believe that AI Gyms, that can be validated and re-\n\ufb01ned throughexperiments, the requirements of ACO motivate an in-\ntegrated design comprising emulation and simulation modes\nto support large scale RL across diverse scenarios.\nWe have made progress towards implementing this design,\nwith the ability to spawn and play games either in simula-\ntion mode or emulation mode with cloud infrastructure.

Cybersecurity is a notable application area, where defending networks against sophisticated adversaries remains a challenging task typically performed by teams of security operators. In this work, we explore novel MARL strategies for building autonomous cyber network defenses that address challenges such as large policy spaces, partial observability, and stealthy, deceptive adversarial strategies. To facilitate efficient and generalized learning, we propose a hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture that decomposes the cyber defense task into specific sub-tasks like network investigation and host recovery. Our approach involves training sub-policies for each sub-task using PPO enhanced with domain expertise. These sub-policies are then leveraged by a master defense policy that coordinates their selection to solve complex network defense tasks. Furthermore, the sub-policies can be fine-tuned and transferred with minimal cost to defend against shifts in adversarial behavior or changes in network settings. We conduct extensive experiments using CybORG Cage 4, the state-of-the-art MARL environment for cyber defense. Comparisons with multiple baselines across different adversaries show that our hierarchical learning approach achieves top performance in terms of convergence speed, episodic return, and several interpretable metrics relevant to cybersecurity, including the fraction of clean machines on the network, precision, and false positives on recoveries.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17351v2\", \"timestamp\": 1729622105, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"21243877-d745-4de0-8c64-1aa3e95e14c0\", \"authors\": [\"Tao Li\", \"Quanyan Zhu\"], \"title\": \"Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare\", \"abstract\": \"We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools.

By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570v2\", \"timestamp\": 1710447477, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"64638118-40dd-4748-8c9b-64eca34c7f0f\", \"authors\": [\"Lampis Alevizos\", \"Lalit Bhakuni\", \"Stefan Jaschke\"], \"title\": \"A Value Driven Framework for Cybersecurity Innovation in Transportation & Infrastructure\", \"abstract\": \"This paper introduces a value-driven cybersecurity innovation framework for the transportation and infrastructure sectors, as opposed to the traditional market-centric approaches that have dominated the field.

This workshop was organized to share research that explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as foundational capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably and effectively defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats.   Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the adoption of AI and ML techniques to both cyber and non-cyber settings. Bridging critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural shifts in user behavior over time.   The Workshop (held on August 19th and 20th 2021 in Montreal-themed virtual reality) was comprised of technical presentations and a panel discussion focused on open problems and potential research solutions.

By improving the adaptability and generalization of these agents, we can significantly enhance the resilience of cybersecurity systems, leading to more robust defenses against attacks. This research could pave the way for future studies on multi-agent systems and their applications in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, ultimately contributing to the development of intelligent, self-learning defense strategies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity of this problem arises from the need for agents to operate effectively in environments with varying network topologies and configurations. Standard reinforcement learning approaches often rely on fixed observation and action spaces, which limits their ability to generalize across different scenarios. Naive methods may fail due to the dynamic nature of cyber environments, where the number of devices and their configurations can change rapidly. Overcoming these challenges requires innovative approaches to policy parameterization and the development of robust training environments that accurately simulate real-world conditions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on static environments or specific network configurations, leading to limitations in the generalizability of the developed agents.

Our approach differs by employing entity-based reinforcement learning, which decomposes the observation and action spaces into discrete entities, allowing for better adaptability and generalization across various network topologies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using entity-based reinforcement learning to train agents in a simulated environment that mimics real-world cyber operations. We will utilize the Yawning Titan cyber-security simulation environment to develop and test our agents, focusing on their ability to generalize across different network configurations.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION Neural networks are mathematical models that simulate the way neurons operate in the brain. The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning.

Due to the large data scale in histology, deep learning methods play an increasingly significant role as feature extractors. Existing solutions heavily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for global pixel-level analysis, leaving the underlying local geometric structure such as the interaction between cells in the tumor microenvironment unexplored. The topological structure in medical images, as proven to be closely related to tumor evolution, can be well characterized by graphs. To obtain a more comprehensive representation for downstream oncology tasks, we propose a fusion framework for enhancing the global image-level representation captured by CNNs with the geometry of cell-level spatial information learned by graph neural networks (GNN). The fusion layer optimizes an integration between collaborative features of global images and cell graphs. Two fusion strategies have been developed: one with MLP which is simple but turns out efficient through fine-tuning, and the other with Transformer gains a champion in fusing multiple networks. We evaluate our fusion strategies on histology datasets curated from large patient cohorts of colorectal and gastric cancers for three biomarker prediction tasks. Both two models outperform plain CNNs or GNNs, reaching a consistent AUC improvement of more than 5% on various network backbones. The experimental results yield the necessity for combining image-level morphological features with cell spatial relations in medical image analysis.

Edges and boundaries encode shape information, while textures manifest the appearance of regions. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision and medical image analysis applications, predominantly only texture abstractions are learned, which often leads to imprecise boundary delineations. In medical imaging, expert manual segmentation often relies on organ boundaries; for example, to manually segment a liver, a medical practitioner usually identifies edges first and subsequently fills in the segmentation mask. Motivated by these observations, we propose a plug-and-play module, dubbed Edge-Gated CNNs (EG-CNNs), that can be used with existing encoder-decoder architectures to process both edge and texture information. The EG-CNN learns to emphasize the edges in the encoder, to predict crisp boundaries by an auxiliary edge supervision, and to fuse its output with the original CNN output. We evaluate the effectiveness of the EG-CNN with various mainstream CNNs on two publicly available datasets, BraTS 19 and KiTS 19 for brain tumor and kidney semantic segmentation.

In this paper, we mine and harvest one major type of clinical annotation data - lesion diameters annotated on bookmarked images - to learn an effective multi-class lesion detector via unsupervised and supervised deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our dataset is composed of 33,688 bookmarked radiology images from 10,825 studies of 4,477 unique patients. For every bookmarked image, a bounding box is created to cover the target lesion based on its measured diameters. We categorize the collection of lesions using an unsupervised deep mining scheme to generate clustered pseudo lesion labels. Next, we adopt a regional-CNN method to detect lesions of multiple categories, regardless of missing annotations (normally only one lesion is annotated, despite the presence of multiple co-existing findings). Our integrated mining, categorization and detection framework is validated with promising empirical results, as a scalable, universal or multi-purpose CAD paradigm built upon abundant retrospective medical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that detection accuracy can be significantly improved by incorporating pseudo lesion labels (e.g., Liver lesion/tumor, Lung nodule/tumor, Abdomen lesions, Chest lymph node and others).

However, the performance of the state-of-the-art models decreases sharply when they are deployed in the real world. We find that the main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text outputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with errors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of the ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key sentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words, which makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of multimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the sentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically refine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues. Specifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to obtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then utilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine the sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual inputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets including MOSI-Speechbrain, MOSI-IBM, and MOSI-iFlytek and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art models on three datasets.

Contrary to previous works in multimodal sentiment analysis which focus on holistic information in speech segments such as bag of words representations and average facial expression intensity, we develop a novel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs modality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated Multimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is composed of 2 modules. The Gated Multimodal Embedding alleviates the difficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal Attention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input modalities and attends to the most important time steps. As a result, the GME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through time and perform better sentiment comprehension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the publicly-available Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis (CMU-MOSI) dataset by achieving state-of-the-art sentiment classification and regression results. Qualitative analysis on our model emphasizes the importance of the Temporal Attention Layer in sentiment prediction because the additional acoustic and visual modalities are noisy.

This paper proposes a novel multimodal sensor fusion method for real-time location-dependent defect detection in the robotic L-DED process. The multimodal fusion sources include a microphone sensor capturing the laser-material interaction sound and a visible spectrum CCD camera capturing the coaxial melt pool images. A hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to fuse acoustic and visual data. The key novelty in this study is that the traditional manual feature extraction procedures are no longer required, and the raw melt pool images and acoustic signals are fused directly by the hybrid CNN model, which achieved the highest defect prediction accuracy (98.5 %) without the thermal sensing modality. Moreover, unlike previous region-based quality prediction, the proposed hybrid CNN can detect the onset of defect occurrences.

Our method is based on an order-preserving pairwise loss adapted to ranking that allows us to improve Mean Averaged Precision measure while taking into account the diversity of the voters that we want to fuse. We provide evidence that this method is naturally adapted to late fusion procedures and confirm the good behavior of our approach on the challenging PASCAL VOC'07 benchmark.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7796v2\", \"timestamp\": 1398876900, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b47c6af3-2725-4156-8aff-f4ddaf9f146c\", \"authors\": [\"Zhenhong Zou\", \"Xinyu Zhang\", \"Huaping Liu\", \"Zhiwei Li\", \"Amir Hussain\", \"Jun Li\"], \"title\": \"A novel multimodal fusion network based on a joint coding model for lane line segmentation\", \"abstract\": \"There has recently been growing interest in utilizing multimodal sensors to achieve robust lane line segmentation.

The forward propagation is thus equal to the information transmission in the channels. Then, we can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the effect of different fusion approaches. We argue the optimal fusion architecture is related to the essential capacity and its allocation based on the source and channel. To test this multimodal fusion hypothesis, we progressively determine a series of multimodal models based on the proposed fusion methods and evaluate them on the KITTI and the A2D2 datasets.

By advancing multimodal fusion techniques, the findings could influence future research in human-centered computing, healthcare AI, and behavioral analysis, ultimately contributing to more effective clinical decision-making and personalized healthcare strategies.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to effectively integrate diverse data modalities (e.g., motion, electromyography, and emotional states) while ensuring that the statistical weighting accurately reflects the importance of each modality. Naive approaches may fail due to the intricate relationships between modalities and the potential for noise in the data. Additionally, achieving high accuracy in real-time applications poses technical challenges, such as computational efficiency and the need for robust models that can generalize across different patient populations.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often focused on single-modality approaches or simplistic fusion techniques that do not account for the nuanced interactions between different data types. Limitations in computational resources and the lack of comprehensive datasets that capture the complexity of pain-related behaviors have also hindered progress. Our approach improves upon prior work by employing a sophisticated statistical weighting strategy and a human-centered design that emphasizes the importance of modality-specific characteristics in the fusion process.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe proposed methodology involves utilizing the EmoPain dataset, which includes multimodal data from chronic pain sufferers and healthy controls. We will implement a hybrid model that combines CNN-Attention mechanisms with statistical weighting strategies to enhance feature extraction and decision-making processes. The evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, and recall in detecting protective behaviors.

rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity\u00a0[15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\u00a0[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling

In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions.

Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9].

In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries.

To tackle unsupervised lifelong ReID, we conduct a contrastive rehearsal on a small number of stored old samples while sequentially adapting to new domains.

A successful approach could lead to more robust models that maintain performance across diverse environments, thereby enhancing the reliability of AI systems in critical applications. This research could pave the way for future studies on continuous domain adaptation, potentially leading to practical solutions that reduce the need for extensive labeled datasets in new domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the significant distributional divergence between source and target domains, which can severely limit the effectiveness of UDA techniques. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the complexities of domain shifts, such as variations in data distributions and the absence of explicit metadata. Additionally, determining the optimal transfer order of intermediate domains without continuous metadata complicates the adaptation process, leading to cumulative errors that degrade model performance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either adapting to specific domains or generalizing to unseen domains, often neglecting the need for a comprehensive approach that addresses both aspects simultaneously. Limitations in existing methodologies, such as reliance on complete target domain data during adaptation, have hindered progress. Our approach aims to integrate domain adaptation and generalization in a complementary manner, addressing the gaps in prior work by leveraging generative replay techniques and selective sample management strategies.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a novel framework that combines Complementary Domain Adaptation and Generalization (CoDAG) with Generative Appearance Replay (GarDA). We will utilize benchmark datasets that reflect real-world domain shifts and evaluate our model's performance using metrics such as classification accuracy and generalization capability across multiple domains.

(2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples.

The effectiveness of the proposed unlearning inversion attacks is evaluated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets across various model architectures and on both exact and approximate representative unlearning approaches.

Traditionally, the development of unlearning algorithms runs parallel with that of membership inference attacks (MIA), a type of privacy threat to determine whether a data instance was used for training. However, the two strands are intimately connected: one can view machine unlearning through the lens of MIA success with respect to removed data. Recognizing this connection, we propose a game-theoretic framework that integrates MIAs into the design of unlearning algorithms. Specifically, we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs to detect the traces of the ostensibly removed data. Adopting this adversarial perspective allows the utilization of new attack advancements, facilitating the design of unlearning algorithms. Our framework stands out in two ways. First, it takes an adversarial approach and proactively incorporates the attacks into the design of unlearning algorithms. Secondly, it uses implicit differentiation to obtain the gradients that limit the attacker's success, thus benefiting the process of unlearning.

These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their \\\"U-MIA\\\" counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into \\\"population U-MIAs\\\", where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and \\\"per-example U-MIAs\\\", where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples.

Traditionally, the development of unlearning algorithms runs parallel with that of membership inference attacks (MIA), a type of privacy threat to determine whether a data instance was used for training. However, the two strands are intimately connected: one can view machine unlearning through the lens of MIA success with respect to removed data. Recognizing this connection, we propose a game-theoretic framework that integrates MIAs into the design of unlearning algorithms. Specifically, we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs to detect the traces of the ostensibly removed data. Adopting this adversarial perspective allows the utilization of new attack advancements, facilitating the design of unlearning algorithms. Our framework stands out in two ways. First, it takes an adversarial approach and proactively incorporates the attacks into the design of unlearning algorithms.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nText-to-image generative models have witnessed significant advancements in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\n\nRobot learning has made inspiring progress in recent years, resulting in robots that can cook\u00a0[1], clean up\u00a0[2], or even perform backflips\u00a0[3]. While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis \u2013 a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent\u2019s side\u00a0[5], hitting to a target position\u00a0[6], smashing\u00a0[7], cooperative rallying\u00a0[8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis\u00a0[9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure\u00a01. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e.\u00a0angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient \u2014 each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings.

With this ball launcher, we enable long-duration training of robot table tennis approaches where the complexity of the ball trajectory can be automatically adjusted, enabling large-scale real-world online reinforcement learning for table tennis robots.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06048v3\", \"timestamp\": 1665567460, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9a85a9de-2f96-4582-85f1-2ebb0c85b74a\", \"authors\": [\"Andreas Ziegler\", \"Thomas Gossard\", \"Karl Vetter\", \"Jonas Tebbe\", \"Andreas Zell\"], \"title\": \"A multi-modal table tennis robot system\", \"abstract\": \"In recent years, robotic table tennis has become a popular research challenge for perception and robot control.

Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15528v1\", \"timestamp\": 1727123211, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"92def8fc-841a-4ef4-b2e8-3e337156decc\", \"authors\": [\"Dieter B\\u00fcchler\", \"Simon Guist\", \"Roberto Calandra\", \"Vincent Berenz\", \"Bernhard Sch\\u00f6lkopf\", \"Jan Peters\"], \"title\": \"Learning to Play Table Tennis From Scratch using Muscular Robots\", \"abstract\": \"Dynamic tasks like table tennis are relatively easy to learn for humans but pose significant challenges to robots. Such tasks require accurate control of fast movements and precise timing in the presence of imprecise state estimation of the flying ball and the robot. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in learning of complex control tasks from data. However, applying step-based RL to dynamic tasks on real systems is safety-critical as RL requires exploring and failing safely for millions of time steps in high-speed regimes. In this paper, we demonstrate that safe learning of table tennis using model-free Reinforcement Learning can be achieved by using robot arms driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). Softness and back-drivability properties of PAMs prevent the system from leaving the safe region of its state space. In this manner, RL empowers the robot to return and smash real balls with 5 m\\\\s and 12m\\\\s on average to a desired landing point. Our setup allows the agent to learn this safety-critical task (i) without safety constraints in the algorithm, (ii) while maximizing the speed of returned balls directly in the reward function (iii) using a stochastic policy that acts directly on the low-level controls of the real system and (iv) trains for thousands of trials (v) from scratch without any prior knowledge. Additionally, we present HYSR, a practical hybrid sim and real training that avoids playing real balls during training by randomly replaying recorded ball trajectories in simulation and applying actions to the real robot. This work is the first to (a) fail-safe learn of a safety-critical dynamic task using anthropomorphic robot arms, (b) learn a precision-demanding problem with a PAM-driven system despite the control challenges and (c) train robots to play table tennis without real balls.

Most of these successes are based on having large numbers of episodes from which the agent can learn. In typical robotic applications, however, the number of feasible attempts is very limited. In this paper we present a sample-efficient RL algorithm applied to the example of a table tennis robot. In table tennis every stroke is different, with varying placement, speed and spin. An accurate return therefore has to be found depending on a high-dimensional continuous state space. To make learning in few trials possible the method is embedded into our robot system. In this way we can use a one-step environment. The state space depends on the ball at hitting time (position, velocity, spin) and the action is the racket state (orientation, velocity) at hitting. An actor-critic based deterministic policy gradient algorithm was developed for accelerated learning. Our approach performs competitively both in a simulation and on the real robot in a number of challenging scenarios.

Achieving human-level performance in a physically demanding sport like table tennis can lead to advancements in robotic control, real-time decision-making, and adaptive strategies. This research could inspire future studies in other complex sports and tasks, enhancing the applicability of robotic systems in various fields, including sports training, rehabilitation, and entertainment.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in this problem stem from the need for high-speed motion, precise control, and real-time decision-making in a dynamic and unpredictable environment. Unlike static or purely strategic games, table tennis requires the robot to not only make strategic decisions but also execute them with high accuracy under varying conditions (e.g., ball speed, spin, and placement). Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of the task, the need for rapid adaptation to different opponents, and the limitations of current learning algorithms in handling such high-dimensional continuous state spaces.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on specific aspects of table tennis, such as ball return or targeted hitting, rather than the full competitive game against human players. Limitations in existing solutions include a lack of comprehensive training environments that simulate real match conditions and the inability to adapt to unseen opponents effectively. Our approach differs by proposing a hierarchical and modular policy architecture that combines low-level skill policies with a high-level controller, enabling the robot to adapt its strategies in real-time based on opponent behavior.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a hierarchical policy architecture that includes multiple low-level skill policies (e.g., forehand topspin, backhand targeting) and a high-level controller that selects the appropriate skill based on the game context. We will utilize a dataset of recorded matches for training and evaluation, focusing on metrics such as win rate against human opponents and the robot's ability to adapt to different playing styles.

The usual unsupervised anomaly detection approach is to train a model for each object class using a dataset of normal samples. However, a more realistic problem is zero-/few-shot anomaly detection where zero or only a few normal samples are available. This makes the training of object-specific models challenging. Recently, large foundation vision-language models have shown strong zero-shot performance in various downstream tasks. While these models have learned complex relationships between vision and language, they are not specifically designed for the tasks of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose the Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine (FADE) which leverages the vision-language CLIP model and adjusts it for the purpose of industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, we improve language-guided anomaly segmentation 1) by adapting CLIP to extract multi-scale image patch embeddings that are better aligned with language and 2) by automatically generating an ensemble of text prompts related to industrial anomaly detection. 3) We use additional vision-based guidance from the query and reference images to further improve both zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection. On the MVTec-AD (and VisA) dataset, FADE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in anomaly segmentation with pixel-AUROC of 89.6% (91.5%) in zero-shot and 95.4% (97.5%) in 1-normal-shot.

The translation from noninvasive brain signals into readable natural language has the potential to promote the application scenario as well as the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as a whole. The critical problem in brain signal decoding or brain-to-language translation is the acquisition of semantically appropriate and discriminative EEG representation from a dataset of limited scale and quality. The proposed BELT method is a generic and efficient framework that bootstraps EEG representation learning using off-the-shelf large-scale pretrained language models (LMs). With a large LM's capacity for understanding semantic information and zero-shot generalization, BELT utilizes large LMs trained on Internet-scale datasets to bring significant improvements to the understanding of EEG signals.   In particular, the BELT model is composed of a deep conformer encoder and a vector quantization encoder. Semantical EEG representation is achieved by a contrastive learning step that provides natural language supervision. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two featuring brain decoding tasks including the brain-to-language translation and zero-shot sentiment classification.

Those techniques can give us prominent results by using only a few training sets reducing the required amounts of data and improving the generalization.

SL-HyDE leverages large language models (LLMs) as generators to generate hypothetical documents based on a given query. These generated documents encapsulate key medical context, guiding a dense retriever in identifying the most relevant documents.

By benchmarking ten models on CMIRB, we establish a rigorous standard for evaluating medical information retrieval systems.

In this paper, we evaluate the \\\"implicit\\\" retrieval robustness of various large language models, instructing them to directly output the final answer without explicitly judging the relevance of the retrieved context. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning on a mix of gold and distracting context significantly enhances the model's robustness to retrieval inaccuracies, while still maintaining its ability to extract correct answers when retrieval is accurate.

This is a limitation, as semantic search, the widely adopted tool retrieval method, can fail when the query is incomplete or lacks context. To address this limitation, we propose Context Tuning for RAG, which employs a smart context retrieval system to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan generation. Our lightweight context retrieval model uses numerical, categorical, and habitual usage signals to retrieve and rank context items. Our empirical results demonstrate that context tuning significantly enhances semantic search, achieving a 3.5-fold and 1.5-fold improvement in Recall@K for context retrieval and tool retrieval tasks respectively, and resulting in an 11.6% increase in LLM-based planner accuracy.

Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can be inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for each query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddings from Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF proposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation task, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest neighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs domain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant. Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single token, thereby improving search latency.

To evaluate our different integration strategies, we transform four existing information retrieval datasets into the relevance feedback scenario.

Our experiments on three public verification datasets show that ProToCo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot fact verification baselines. With a small number of unlabeled instances, ProToCo also outperforms the strong zero-shot learner T0 on zero-shot verification.

This research could lead to advancements in various applications, such as medical information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and fact verification, ultimately making LLMs more accessible and effective across diverse fields. By addressing this question, we can pave the way for more robust AI systems that require less data to perform effectively, thus reducing the cost and time associated with data annotation.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in enhancing few-shot learning capabilities stem from the inherent limitations of LLMs in understanding context and generalizing from minimal examples. Naive approaches may fail due to overfitting on the few examples provided or misinterpretation of the context, leading to poor performance. Additionally, the complexity of integrating various learning paradigms, such as in-context learning and data generation, poses significant technical hurdles. There is also the challenge of ensuring that the model can effectively leverage the limited data without compromising its performance on unseen tasks.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on traditional supervised learning methods, which require large datasets for training, leaving a gap in exploring few-shot learning techniques. Existing solutions often lack the flexibility to adapt to new tasks without extensive retraining. Moreover, the integration of different learning paradigms, such as in-context learning and task-specific data generation, has not been thoroughly investigated. Our approach aims to bridge these gaps by combining in-context learning distillation with innovative data generation techniques, thus providing a more comprehensive framework for few-shot learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components: \n1. **Method**: We will implement in-context learning distillation to transfer the few-shot learning abilities of large models to smaller models, combining in-context learning objectives with language modeling objectives.\n2. **Dataset**: We will utilize benchmark datasets such as LAMA and CrossFit for evaluation.\n3. **Metrics**: Performance will be measured using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics across various NLP tasks.\n4. **Expected Outcomes**: We anticipate that our approach will yield significant improvements in few-shot learning performance, enabling smaller models to achieve results comparable to larger models while maintaining efficiency and scalability. This could lead to broader applications of LLMs in real-world scenarios where data is limited.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [4, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 85866, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 4, "agent2": 4, "agent3": 4, "agent4": 5, "agent5": 4}, "total_milestones": 6, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 3}}

Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems.

Cascade architecture, composed of retrieval, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, is usually adopted to reduce the computational cost. Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and calculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs. The multi-stage ranking strategy causes a new problem - the ranked lists of the ranking stage and previous stages may be inconsistent. For example, items that should be ranked at the top of the ranking stage may be ranked at the bottom of previous stages. In this paper, we focus on the \\\\textbf{ranking consistency} between the pre-ranking and ranking stages. Specifically, we formally define the problem of ranking consistency and propose the Ranking Consistency Score (RCS) metric for evaluation. We demonstrate that ranking consistency has a direct impact on online performance. Compared with the traditional evaluation manner that mainly focuses on the individual ranking quality of every objective, RCS considers the ranking consistency of the fused final objective, which is more proper for evaluation. Finally, to improve the ranking consistency, we propose several methods from the perspective of sample selection and learning algorithms.

To deal with the massive web contents, DRS employs a two-stage workflow: retrieval and ranking, to generate its recommendation results. The retriever aims to select a small set of relevant candidates from the entire items with high efficiency; while the ranker, usually more precise but time-consuming, is supposed to further refine the best items from the retrieved candidates.

A key challenge in RS is efficiently processing vast item pools to deliver highly personalized recommendations under strict latency constraints. Multi-stage cascade ranking addresses this by employing computationally efficient retrieval methods to cover diverse user interests, followed by more precise ranking models to refine the results. In the retrieval stage, multi-channel retrieval is often used to generate distinct item subsets from different candidate generators, leveraging the complementary strengths of these methods to maximize coverage. However, forwarding all retrieved items overwhelms downstream rankers, necessitating truncation. Despite advancements in individual retrieval methods, multi-channel fusion, the process of efficiently merging multi-channel retrieval results, remains underexplored. We are the first to identify and systematically investigate multi-channel fusion in the retrieval stage. Current industry practices often rely on heuristic approaches and manual designs, which often lead to suboptimal performance.

As the early and final stage ranking use different features and model architectures because of system constraints, a serious ranking consistency issue arises where the early stage has a low ads recall, i.e., top ads in the final stage are ranked low in the early stage. In order to pass better ads from the early to the final stage ranking, we propose a multi-task learning framework for early stage ranking to capture multiple final stage ranking components (i.e. ads clicks and ads quality events) and their task relations. With our multi-task learning framework, we can not only achieve serving cost saving from the model consolidation, but also improve the ads recall and ranking consistency.

However, two major challenges in pre-ranking system still exist: (i) without explicitly modeling the performance gain versus computation cost, the predefined latency constraint in the pre-ranking stage inevitably leads to suboptimal solutions; (ii) transferring the ranking teacher's knowledge to a pre-ranking student with a predetermined handcrafted architecture still suffers from the loss of model performance. In this work, a novel framework AutoFAS is proposed which jointly optimizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-ranking model: (i) AutoFAS for the first time simultaneously selects the most valuable features and network architectures using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique; (ii) equipped with ranking model guided reward during NAS procedure, AutoFAS can select the best pre-ranking architecture for a given ranking teacher without any computation overhead.

We propose a hybrid contextual bandit approach, called CascadeHybrid, for solving this problem. CascadeHybrid models item relevance and topical diversity using two independent functions and simultaneously learns those functions from user click feedback. We conduct experiments to evaluate CascadeHybrid on two real-world recommendation datasets: MovieLens and Yahoo music datasets. Our experimental results show that CascadeHybrid outperforms the baselines. In addition, we prove theoretical guarantees on the $n$-step performance demonstrating the soundness of CascadeHybrid.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00508v3\", \"timestamp\": 1575237798, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we improve the ranking consistency between the pre-ranking and ranking stages in multi-stage recommender systems to enhance overall recommendation accuracy?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nImproving ranking consistency is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and engagement in recommender systems, as inconsistencies can lead to poor user experiences. Addressing this problem could lead to more effective algorithms that better align the outputs of different stages in the recommendation process, ultimately advancing the field of information retrieval and recommender systems. This research could also have practical applications in various industries, such as e-commerce and online advertising, where accurate recommendations are essential for driving conversions and user retention.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent differences in the objectives and features used in the pre-ranking and ranking stages, which can lead to inconsistencies in the ranked lists produced by each stage. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the complex interactions between the stages or the need for a unified evaluation metric that considers both stages' outputs. Additionally, technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated models that can effectively bridge the gap between the two stages while maintaining efficiency and accuracy.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either the ranking or retrieval stages, often neglecting the critical interactions between them. Existing solutions may lack a comprehensive framework that addresses the entire cascade process, leading to suboptimal performance. Barriers include the complexity of designing models that can effectively learn from the outputs of both stages and the absence of metrics that evaluate ranking consistency across stages. Our approach aims to fill this gap by proposing a multi-task learning framework that captures the relationships between the stages.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously optimizes the pre-ranking and ranking stages by capturing their interdependencies. We will utilize real-world datasets from e-commerce platforms to evaluate our approach, focusing on metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) to measure performance improvements. The expected outcomes include enhanced ranking consistency, improved user engagement, and a more efficient recommendation process that can be deployed in real-time systems.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}]}

Deep image classifiers often leverage them for predictions, leading to poor generalization on the data where the correlations do not hold. Mitigating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial towards robust model generalization, but it often requires annotations of the spurious correlations in data -- a strong assumption in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework based on meta-learning, termed SPUME -- SPUriousness-aware MEta-learning, to train an image classifier to be robust to spurious correlations. We design the framework to iteratively detect and mitigate the spurious correlations that the classifier excessively relies on for predictions. To achieve this, we first propose to utilize a pre-trained vision-language model to extract text-format attributes from images. These attributes enable us to curate data with various class-attribute correlations, and we formulate a novel metric to measure the degree of these correlations' spuriousness. Then, to mitigate the reliance on spurious correlations, we propose a meta-learning strategy in which the support (training) sets and query (test) sets in tasks are curated with different spurious correlations that have high degrees of spuriousness. By meta-training the classifier on these spuriousness-aware meta-learning tasks, our classifier can learn to be invariant to the spurious correlations.

Training classifiers robust to spurious correlations typically relies on annotations of spurious correlations in data, which are often expensive to get. In this paper, we tackle an annotation-free setting and propose a self-guided spurious correlation mitigation framework. Our framework automatically constructs fine-grained training labels tailored for a classifier obtained with empirical risk minimization to improve its robustness against spurious correlations. The fine-grained training labels are formulated with different prediction behaviors of the classifier identified in a novel spuriousness embedding space. We construct the space with automatically detected conceptual attributes and a novel spuriousness metric which measures how likely a class-attribute correlation is exploited for predictions. We demonstrate that training the classifier to distinguish different prediction behaviors reduces its reliance on spurious correlations without knowing them a priori and outperforms prior methods on five real-world datasets.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03649v1\", \"timestamp\": 1715015541, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"1f1c3a19-2161-4bec-9040-7a2d8cd21a4e\", \"authors\": [\"Soumya Suvra Ghosal\", \"Yifei Ming\", \"Yixuan Li\"], \"title\": \"Are Vision Transformers Robust to Spurious Correlations?\", \"abstract\": \"Deep neural networks may be susceptible to learning spurious correlations that hold on average but not in atypical test samples.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of vision transformers to spurious correlations on three challenging benchmark datasets and compare their performance with popular CNNs. Our study reveals that when pre-trained on a sufficiently large dataset, ViT models are more robust to spurious correlations than CNNs. Key to their success is the ability to generalize better from the examples where spurious correlations do not hold.

However, most models developed under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical correlations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable correlation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training distribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution data by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE could successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable contribution of historical records for predictions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01321v1\", \"timestamp\": 1662178245, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"8733d158-bc03-4c2f-9e01-581af1663f25\", \"authors\": [\"Nilesh Kumar\", \"Ruby Shrestha\", \"Zhiyuan Li\", \"Linwei Wang\"], \"title\": \"Distributionally Robust Optimization and Invariant Representation Learning for Addressing Subgroup Underrepresentation: Mechanisms and Limitations\", \"abstract\": \"Spurious correlation caused by subgroup underrepresentation has received increasing attention as a source of bias that can be perpetuated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Distributionally robust optimization has shown success in addressing this bias, although the underlying working mechanism mostly relies on upweighting under-performing samples as surrogates for those underrepresented in data. At the same time, while invariant representation learning has been a powerful choice for removing nuisance-sensitive features, it has been little considered in settings where spurious correlations are caused by significant underrepresentation of subgroups. In this paper, we take the first step to better understand and improve the mechanisms for debiasing spurious correlation due to subgroup underrepresentation in medical image classification.

Mitigating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial towards robust model generalization, but it often requires annotations of the spurious correlations in data -- a strong assumption in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework based on meta-learning, termed SPUME -- SPUriousness-aware MEta-learning, to train an image classifier to be robust to spurious correlations. We design the framework to iteratively detect and mitigate the spurious correlations that the classifier excessively relies on for predictions. To achieve this, we first propose to utilize a pre-trained vision-language model to extract text-format attributes from images. These attributes enable us to curate data with various class-attribute correlations, and we formulate a novel metric to measure the degree of these correlations' spuriousness. Then, to mitigate the reliance on spurious correlations, we propose a meta-learning strategy in which the support (training) sets and query (test) sets in tasks are curated with different spurious correlations that have high degrees of spuriousness. By meta-training the classifier on these spuriousness-aware meta-learning tasks, our classifier can learn to be invariant to the spurious correlations.

However, most models developed under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical correlations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable correlation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training distribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution data by a large margin.

By solving this issue, we can advance the field of machine learning by providing methods that do not require extensive human annotation, thus making robust model training more accessible. This research could lead to practical applications in various domains, such as healthcare and autonomous systems, where reliable predictions are essential.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of identifying and mitigating spurious correlations without explicit annotations. Naive approaches may fail because they might not adequately differentiate between genuine features and spurious correlations, leading to overfitting. Additionally, the lack of a clear understanding of how these correlations manifest in different datasets complicates the development of effective solutions. Technical obstacles include the need for sophisticated representation learning techniques and the integration of self-supervised learning methods to avoid representation collapse.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research often relies on annotated data to identify spurious correlations, which is not feasible in many practical scenarios. Existing solutions may not adequately address the variability of spurious correlations across different datasets or fail to generalize well.

Second, we will employ a meta-learning strategy to train the model on tasks curated with varying degrees of spuriousness.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

This variability\nnecessitates a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with \u03b7= 1,9dB is shown in Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed \u03bb, the bpp values of the random initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different \u03b7values which\nmatches the analysis of the empirical distribution, \u02c6P\u02dcx\u03b7shown\nin Fig. 7. Thus, we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\noutput distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\nMoreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe that the pre-trained model yields more\n\u2018distinct\u2019 output distribution w.r.t different SNR values.\nC.

Our model incorporates the nonlinear transform as a strong prior to effectively extract the source semantic features and provide side information for source-channel coding. Unlike existing conventional deep joint source-channel coding methods, the proposed NTSCC essentially learns both the source latent representation and an entropy model as the prior on the latent representation.

Nonetheless, the majority of existing DL-based JSCC methods are tailored for scenarios featuring stable channel conditions, notably a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This specialization poses a limitation, as their performance tends to wane in practical scenarios marked by highly dynamic channels, given that a fixed SNR inadequately represents the dynamic nature of such channels. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel solution, namely deep refinement-based JSCC (DRJSCC). This innovative method is designed to seamlessly adapt to channels exhibiting temporal variations. By leveraging instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we dynamically optimize the encoding strategy through re-encoding the channel symbols. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the encoding strategy consistently aligns with the varying channel conditions during the transmission process. Specifically, our approach begins with the division of encoded symbols into multiple blocks, which are transmitted progressively to the receiver. In the event of changing channel conditions, we propose a mechanism to re-encode the remaining blocks, allowing them to adapt to the current channel conditions.

The numerical results indicate that the average data rate increases nearly an order of magnitude for an optimized number of fog nodes in case of shadowing and fading.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet\u00a0[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

A unified framework could lead to significant improvements in the quality of restored images across diverse applications, such as old photo restoration, medical imaging, and surveillance. This research could pave the way for future studies that explore more complex degradation scenarios and enhance the robustness of image restoration techniques, ultimately benefiting both academic research and practical applications in various industries.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent complexity of real-world image degradations, which can vary widely and are often unknown. Naive approaches may fail because they typically assume a specific degradation model, limiting their applicability. Additionally, the need for a model that can adapt to multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge introduces significant technical and theoretical obstacles, such as the design of effective algorithms that can generalize well across different scenarios and the computational resources required for training such models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on specific degradation types, leading to methods that lack generalization capabilities. Many existing solutions are either too sensitive to variations in degradation models or require extensive training on large datasets with known degradations. Barriers include the difficulty in creating robust models that can dynamically adapt to unknown conditions and the lack of comprehensive datasets that encompass a wide range of degradation scenarios. Our approach aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging generative diffusion models and adaptive techniques that can handle multiple degradation types in a unified manner.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a two-stage framework for BIR: (1) degradation removal, which focuses on eliminating image-independent content, and (2) information regeneration, which aims to reconstruct lost image details. We will utilize generative diffusion models to enhance the restoration process, allowing for dynamic adaptation to various degradation types. The methodology will be evaluated using diverse datasets that include both synthetic and real-world images, with metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to assess restoration quality.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning.

For humans, languages with more compositional and transparent structures are typically easier to learn than those with opaque and irregular structures.

Here, we directly test how neural networks compare to humans in learning and generalizing different languages that vary in their degree of compositional structure. We evaluate the memorization and generalization capabilities of a large language model and recurrent neural networks, and show that both deep neural networks exhibit a learnability advantage for more structured linguistic input: neural networks exposed to more compositional languages show more systematic generalization, greater agreement between different agents, and greater similarity to human learners.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12239v4\", \"timestamp\": 1677178654, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"fe697277-4c28-42af-b1de-2da572fcf765\", \"authors\": [\"Soham Dan\", \"Osbert Bastani\", \"Dan Roth\"], \"title\": \"Understanding Robust Generalization in Learning Regular Languages\", \"abstract\": \"A key feature of human intelligence is the ability to generalize beyond the training distribution, for instance, parsing longer sentences than seen in the past. Currently, deep neural networks struggle to generalize robustly to such shifts in the data distribution. We study robust generalization in the context of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn regular languages. We hypothesize that standard end-to-end modeling strategies cannot generalize well to systematic distribution shifts and propose a compositional strategy to address this. We compare an end-to-end strategy that maps strings to labels with a compositional strategy that predicts the structure of the deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) that accepts the regular language. We theoretically prove that the compositional strategy generalizes significantly better than the end-to-end strategy. In our experiments, we implement the compositional strategy via an auxiliary task where the goal is to predict the intermediate states visited by the DFA when parsing a string. Our empirical results support our hypothesis, showing that auxiliary tasks can enable robust generalization. Interestingly, the end-to-end RNN generalizes significantly better than the theoretical lower bound, suggesting that it is able to achieve at least some degree of robust generalization.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09717v1\", \"timestamp\": 1645325409, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f1e634df-19d2-4242-b2c8-7654e175abe4\", \"authors\": [\"Sungjun Han\", \"Sebastian Pad\\u00f3\"], \"title\": \"Towards Understanding the Relationship between In-context Learning and Compositional Generalization\", \"abstract\": \"According to the principle of compositional generalization, the meaning of a complex expression can be understood as a function of the meaning of its parts and of how they are combined. This principle is crucial for human language processing and also, arguably, for NLP models in the face of out-of-distribution data. However, many neural network models, including Transformers, have been shown to struggle with compositional generalization. In this paper, we hypothesize that forcing models to in-context learn can provide an inductive bias to promote compositional generalization. To test this hypothesis, we train a causal Transformer in a setting that renders ordinary learning very difficult: we present it with different orderings of the training instance and shuffle instance labels. This corresponds to training the model on all possible few-shot learning problems attainable from the dataset. The model can solve the task, however, by utilizing earlier examples to generalize to later ones (i.e. in-context learning). In evaluations on the datasets, SCAN, COGS, and GeoQuery, models trained in this manner indeed show improved compositional generalization.

The application of the law of large numbers [2, 3, 6] and the application of mathematical inductions make the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis self-contained and complete to make sure that the whole complex plane is covered as conjectured in Riemann Hypothesis.

In this study, we find that such $1/f$ noise is also found in deep neural networks trained on natural language, resembling that of their biological counterparts. Specifically, we trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on the `IMDb' AI benchmark dataset, then measured the neuron activations. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on the time series of the different neurons demonstrate clear $1/f$ patterns, which is absent in the time series of the inputs to the LSTM. Interestingly, when the neural network is at overcapacity, having more than enough neurons to achieve the learning task, the activation patterns deviate from $1/f$ noise and shifts towards white noise. This is because many of the neurons are not effectively used, showing little fluctuations when fed with input data. We further examine the exponent values in the $1/f$ noise in ``internal\\\" and ``external\\\" activations in the LSTM cell, finding some resemblance in the variations of the exponents in fMRI signals of the human brain. Our findings further supports the hypothesis that $1/f$ noise is a signature of optimal learning.

It could lead to the development of neural networks that exhibit more human-like understanding and reasoning capabilities, enhancing applications in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and machine learning. This research could pave the way for more effective models in tasks requiring compositional reasoning and generalization, ultimately impacting fields such as robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent differences between linguistic and non-linguistic data. While language models can leverage the structured nature of language, translating this structure to visual or sensory data is complex. Naive approaches may fail due to the lack of explicit compositionality in non-linguistic data, making it difficult to capture hierarchical relationships and semantic meanings. Additionally, the need for unsupervised learning adds another layer of complexity, as it requires the model to derive meaningful representations without labeled data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either linguistic data or specific types of visual representations, often neglecting the integration of compositional structures from non-linguistic observations. Existing models may lack the necessary architecture to effectively learn and generate structured representations from diverse data types.

(2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead.

Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort.

(2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort.

Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job creation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its transformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can adopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering the causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way, entrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and analysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies causal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative innovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the entrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious gap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the entrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity, proactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour influence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we analysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities in southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation methodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results show, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship learning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in the field of entrepreneurial intentions.

A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver cancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to other treatment sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRL-based automatic treatment planning model capable of achieving human-level performance for H&N cancers.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11576v1\", \"timestamp\": 1726610516, \"domain\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent4", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"0d3db447-f94f-465b-af20-c2925b270201\", \"authors\": [\"Ryan Yang\", \"Tom Silver\", \"Aidan Curtis\", \"Tomas Lozano-Perez\", \"Leslie Pack Kaelbling\"], \"title\": \"PG3: Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generation\", \"abstract\": \"A longstanding objective in classical planning is to synthesize policies that generalize across multiple problems from the same domain. In this work, we study generalized policy search-based methods with a focus on the score function used to guide the search over policies. We demonstrate limitations of two score functions and propose a new approach that overcomes these limitations. The main idea behind our approach, Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generation (PG3), is that a candidate policy should be used to guide planning on training problems as a mechanism for evaluating that candidate. Theoretical results in a simplified setting give conditions under which PG3 is optimal or admissible. We then study a specific instantiation of policy search where planning problems are PDDL-based and policies are lifted decision lists. Empirical results in six domains confirm that PG3 learns generalized policies more efficiently and effectively than several baselines.

We tackle this planning issue by extending the policy gradient theory to policy updates with respect to any state density. Under these generalized policy updates, we show convergence to optimality under a necessary and sufficient condition on the updates' state densities, and thereby solve the aforementioned planning issue. We also prove asymptotic convergence rates that significantly improve those in the policy gradient literature.   To implement the principles prescribed by our theory, we propose an agent, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde (JH), with a double personality: Dr Jekyll purely exploits while Mr Hyde purely explores. JH's independent policies allow to record two separate replay buffers: one on-policy (Dr Jekyll's) and one off-policy (Mr Hyde's), and therefore to update JH's models with a mixture of on-policy and off-policy updates. More than an algorithm, JH defines principles for actor-critic algorithms to satisfy the requirements we identify in our analysis. We extensively test on finite MDPs where JH demonstrates a superior ability to recover from converging to a suboptimal policy without impairing its speed of convergence.

In addition to sequential composition, we introduce a composition of policies based on generalized logic composition: Given sub-policies for sub-tasks and a new task expressed as logic compositions of subtasks, a semi-optimal policy, which is optimal in planning with only sub-policies, can be obtained by simply composing sub-polices. Thus, a synthesis algorithm is developed to compute optimal policies efficiently by planning with primitive actions, policies for sub-tasks, and the compositions of sub-policies, for maximizing the probability of satisfying temporal logic specifications.

We use policy equivalences to prune part of the policy search space, making AND* substantially more effective in solving FOND tasks. We also study the impact of taking into account structural state-space symmetries to strengthen the detection of equivalence policies and the impact of performing the search with satisficing techniques. We apply a recent technique from the group theory literature to better compute structural state-space symmetries. Finally, we present a solution compressor that, given a policy defined over complete states, finds a policy that unambiguously represents it using the minimum number of partial states.

This research could significantly impact future studies by providing new methodologies for policy learning that can be applied across various domains, including robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. By improving the expressiveness of learned policies, we can enable agents to perform more sophisticated tasks, ultimately leading to practical applications that require higher levels of reasoning and adaptability.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the inherent limitations of existing feature selection methods, which often fail to capture the complexity of state transitions and actions in planning problems. Naive approaches may overlook the necessity of incorporating richer logical features, leading to suboptimal policy learning. Additionally, the computational complexity associated with scaling up expressive models, such as k-GNNs, poses significant obstacles. The need for efficient message passing and embedding techniques that can handle triplet relationships without excessive computational costs complicates the development of effective solutions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either combinatorial approaches or deep learning methods, both of which are constrained by their expressive power. The limitations of C2 logic in description logics and the inability of GNNs to effectively process triplet relationships have hindered progress. Additionally, the lack of awareness regarding the importance of complex logical features in policy learning has contributed to this gap. Our approach aims to integrate richer grammars and advanced GNN architectures to address these limitations, providing a more comprehensive framework for policy learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a parameterized version of Relational GNNs (R-GNNs) that accepts transformed sets of atoms to enhance expressiveness. We will utilize a combination of simulation environments and real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our model. Key metrics will include policy accuracy, computational efficiency, and the ability to generalize across different planning domains.

It has emerged as one of the most convenient and natural methods to interact with the web and is especially desirable in voice-controlled environments. Despite being one of the oldest research areas, the current QA system faces the critical challenge of handling multilingual queries. To build an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent that can serve multilingual end users, a QA system is required to be language versatile and tailored to suit the multilingual environment. Recent advances in QA models have enabled surpassing human performance primarily due to the availability of a sizable amount of high-quality datasets. However, the majority of such annotated datasets are expensive to create and are only confined to the English language, making it challenging to acknowledge progress in foreign languages. Therefore, to measure a similar improvement in the multilingual QA system, it is necessary to invest in high-quality multilingual evaluation benchmarks. In this dissertation, we focus on advancing QA techniques for handling end-user queries in multilingual environments. This dissertation consists of two parts. In the first part, we explore multilingualism and a new dimension of multilingualism referred to as code-mixing.

However, existing multilingual training overlooks the language-specific information which is crucial for modeling source code across different programming languages, while only focusing on learning a unified model with shared parameters among different languages for language-agnostic information modeling. To address this problem, we propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual code representation learning.

Most benchmarks for multilinguality focus on classic NLP tasks, or cover a minimal number of languages. We introduce MEXA, a method for assessing the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained English-centric LLMs using parallel sentences, which are available for more languages than existing downstream tasks. MEXA leverages the fact that English-centric LLMs use English as a kind of pivot language in their intermediate layers. It computes the alignment between English and non-English languages using parallel sentences to evaluate the transfer of language understanding from English to other languages. This alignment can be used to estimate model performance in other languages. We conduct studies using various parallel datasets (FLORES-200 and Bible), models (Llama family, Gemma family, Mistral, and OLMo), and established downstream tasks (Belebele, m-MMLU, and m-ARC). We explore different methods to compute embeddings in decoder-only models. Our results show that MEXA, in its default settings, achieves a statistically significant average Pearson correlation of 0.90 with three established downstream tasks across nine models and two parallel datasets. This suggests that MEXA is a reliable method for estimating the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs, providing a clearer understanding of their multilingual potential and the inner workings of LLMs. Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/cis-lmu/Mexa, Code: https://github.com/cisnlp/Mexa.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05873v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728381563, \"domain\": \"cs.CL\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0444931d-4315-45e5-a28e-35cf9f121fed\", \"authors\": [\"Jiacheng Ye\", \"Xijia Tao\", \"Lingpeng Kong\"], \"title\": \"Language Versatilists vs. Specialists: An Empirical Revisiting on Multilingual Transfer Ability\", \"abstract\": \"Multilingual transfer ability, which reflects how well the models fine-tuned on one source language can be applied to other languages, has been well studied in multilingual pre-trained models (e.g., BLOOM).

This research could lead to significant advancements in natural language processing, enabling more inclusive AI applications across diverse linguistic communities. By improving multilingual capabilities, we can enhance user experience in global applications, foster cross-cultural communication, and support language preservation efforts.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges include the scarcity of high-quality training data for low-resource languages, the complexity of aligning model performance across multiple languages, and the need for effective transfer learning techniques. Naive approaches may fail due to the inherent differences in linguistic structures and cultural contexts, which can lead to biased or inaccurate outputs. Additionally, ensuring that models maintain performance across a wide range of languages while avoiding overfitting to high-resource languages presents a significant technical obstacle.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on high-resource languages, leaving a gap in understanding and developing effective multilingual models for low-resource languages. Limitations in available datasets, lack of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and insufficient attention to the unique challenges posed by low-resource languages have hindered progress. Our approach will leverage recent advancements in data augmentation, cross-lingual feedback, and multilingual instruction tuning to address these gaps and improve upon existing models.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the following key components: \n1. **Method**: We will implement a multilingual instruction tuning framework that incorporates diverse datasets, including low-resource language corpora and cross-lingual human feedback.\n2. **Dataset**: We will curate a comprehensive multilingual dataset that includes high-quality examples from both high-resource and low-resource languages.\n3. **Metrics**: Performance will be evaluated using multilingual benchmarks, focusing on translation accuracy, language understanding, and user satisfaction.\n4. **Expected Outcomes**: We anticipate that our enhanced model will demonstrate improved performance in low-resource languages, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual tasks and providing a robust foundation for future research in inclusive AI applications.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": []}], "planning_scores": [5, 5], "communication_scores": [-1, -1], "token_usage": 89486, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 3, "agent2": 4, "agent4": 4, "agent3": 3, "agent5": 4}, "total_milestones": 7, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 5, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance.

Then, we use DARE as a versatile plug-in to sparsify delta parameters of multiple SFT homologous models for mitigating parameter interference and merge them into a single model by parameter fusing.

Notably, this phenomenon is more pronounced in large-scale LMs, where the merged LM reveals the potential to surpass the performance of any source LM, providing a new discovery.

A successful merging technique could lead to the development of more compact and versatile models that retain high performance across various tasks. This advancement could significantly reduce computational costs and memory usage, making machine learning more accessible and efficient. Furthermore, it could pave the way for new applications in areas where resource constraints are critical, such as mobile devices and edge computing.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of parameter interactions within and across models. Naive approaches, such as random parameter dropping or simple magnitude-based selection, may overlook important task-specific information, leading to degraded performance. Additionally, the theoretical understanding of how different models' parameters interact is still limited, making it difficult to devise a robust merging strategy. Overcoming these obstacles requires sophisticated methods to assess parameter importance and manage the trade-offs between model compactness and performance.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on individual model fine-tuning rather than on the merging of multiple models. Existing solutions often fail to consider the nuanced interactions between parameters from different models, leading to suboptimal performance. Barriers include a lack of comprehensive methodologies for evaluating parameter significance and the computational complexity involved in merging models effectively. Our approach aims to fill these gaps by introducing a systematic method for parameter selection and merging that leverages insights from recent advancements in model compression and transfer learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a three-step process: (1) Implementing a novel pruning technique, MAGPRUNE, to selectively drop delta parameters based on their magnitudes; (2) Utilizing sign-based selection to further refine the parameter set; and (3) Merging the selected parameters into a single model. We will evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets (e.g., AlpacaEval, GSM8K, MBPP) and compare performance metrics against existing methods like DARE.

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.

This finding further emphasizes the effectiveness of our proposed regularization Related Work\nLatent Graph Inference. Given only the node features of data, latent graph inference (LGI) aims to\nsimultaneously learn the underlying graph structure and discriminative node representations from the\nfeatures of data [10, 24, 39]. For example, Jiang et al. [15] propose to infer the graph structure by\ncombining graph learning and graph convolution in a unified framework. Yang et al. [45] model the\ntopology refinement as a label propagation process. Jin et al. [16] explore some intrinsic properties of\nthe latent graph and propose a robust LGI framework to defend adversarial attacks on graphs.

Latent graph inference allows models to dynamically learn the intrinsic graph structure of problems where the connectivity patterns of data may not be directly accessible. In this work, we generalize the discrete Differentiable Graph Module (dDGM) for latent graph learning. The original dDGM architecture used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static embedding space. Our novel approach is tested on a wide range of datasets, and outperforms the original dDGM model.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16199v3\", \"timestamp\": 1669500786, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"b2ad0d19-9fa3-4466-a78e-15f305b8db61\", \"authors\": [\"Haitz S\\u00e1ez de Oc\\u00e1riz Borde\", \"Anastasis Kratsios\"], \"title\": \"Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries\", \"abstract\": \"The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003v1\", \"timestamp\": 1698073046, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"976ec62f-b9a6-464f-8343-bbb0c29de0a6\", \"authors\": [\"Jedidiah Harwood\", \"Debashis Paul\", \"Jie Peng\"], \"title\": \"Inferring Latent Graphs from Stationary Signals Using a Graphical Autoregressive Model\", \"abstract\": \"Graphs are an intuitive way to represent relationships between variables in fields such as finance and neuroscience. However, these graphs often need to be inferred from data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to infer a latent graph by treating the observed multidimensional data as graph-referenced stationary signals. Specifically, we introduce the graphical autoregressive model (GAR), where the inverse covariance matrix of the observed signals is expressed as a second-order polynomial of the normalized graph Laplacian of the latent graph. The GAR model extends the autoregressive model from time series analysis to general undirected graphs, offering a new approach to graph inference. To estimate the latent graph, we develop a three-step procedure based on penalized maximum likelihood, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Simulation studies and an application to S&P 500 stock price data show that the GAR model can outperform Gaussian graphical models when it fits the observed data well. Our results suggest that the GAR model offers a promising new direction for inferring latent graphs across diverse applications.

Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to operate on point cloud data, dynamically learning the necessary graph structure. These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework, a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal embedding space.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to infer a latent graph by treating the observed multidimensional data as graph-referenced stationary signals. Specifically, we introduce the graphical autoregressive model (GAR), where the inverse covariance matrix of the observed signals is expressed as a second-order polynomial of the normalized graph Laplacian of the latent graph. The GAR model extends the autoregressive model from time series analysis to general undirected graphs, offering a new approach to graph inference. To estimate the latent graph, we develop a three-step procedure based on penalized maximum likelihood, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Simulation studies and an application to S&P 500 stock price data show that the GAR model can outperform Gaussian graphical models when it fits the observed data well.

Hybrid recommender systems combine multiple recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit from their complementary advantages. Some hybrid recommender systems have combined collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to build systems that are more robust. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system, which combines Alternating Least Squares (ALS) based collaborative filtering with deep learning to enhance recommendation performance as well as overcome the limitations associated with the collaborative filtering approach, especially concerning its cold start problem. In essence, we use the outputs from ALS (collaborative filtering) to influence the recommendations from a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which combines characteristic, contextual, structural and sequential information, in a big data processing framework. We have conducted several experiments in testing the efficacy of the proposed hybrid architecture in recommending smartphones to prospective customers and compared its performance with other open-source recommenders. The results have shown that the proposed system has outperformed several existing hybrid recommender systems.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12876v2\", \"timestamp\": 1622070651, \"domain\": \"cs.IR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"6ffa6f44-7564-4f99-bc06-aadb26cf23ce\", \"authors\": [\"Xiang Yan\", \"Benjamin Van Roy\"], \"title\": \"Manipulation Robustness of Collaborative Filtering Systems\", \"abstract\": \"A collaborative filtering system recommends to users products that similar users like.

This research could lead to more personalized user experiences, reduce information overload, and increase the efficiency of recommendation systems. Furthermore, advancements in this area could inspire new methodologies in machine learning and data science, influencing future research directions and practical applications across multiple domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in this research stem from the complexity of accurately modeling user-item interactions in high-dimensional spaces and the inherent sparsity of interaction data. Naive approaches may fail to capture the nuanced relationships between users and items, leading to suboptimal recommendations. Additionally, existing graph convolutional networks often operate as low-pass filters, which may overlook critical high-frequency information necessary for effective recommendations. Overcoming these technical and theoretical obstacles requires innovative methodologies that can adaptively filter and represent data.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on traditional collaborative filtering methods and basic graph convolutional networks, which often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying data distributions and user preferences. Limitations in existing models, such as their reliance on fixed bandwidth filters and inability to capture complex relationships, have hindered progress. Our approach aims to address these gaps by introducing adaptive filtering techniques and causal modeling, which have not been extensively explored in the context of collaborative filtering.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing an advanced graph convolutional network that incorporates adaptive filtering mechanisms to enhance the representation of user-item interactions.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2023; Liu et\u00a0al., 2023; Kamata et\u00a0al., 2023; Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et\u00a0al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201dInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201d (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2. Related Work\n\n\n2.1. Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\u00a0al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the \u201dnerfacto\u201d model implemented by Nerfstudio (Tancik et\u00a0al., 2023), which is a combination of modular features from multiple papers (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021; Barron et\u00a0al., 2022; M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et\u00a0al., 2021; Verbin et\u00a0al., 2022)\n, designed to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.

We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face.

In this work, we overcome the limitations of existing methods by rendering stylized novel views from a NeRF without the need for per-scene or per-style optimization. To this end, we take advantage of a generalizable NeRF model to facilitate style transfer in 3D, thereby enabling the use of a single learned model across various scenes. By incorporating a hypernetwork into a generalizable NeRF, our approach enables on-the-fly generation of stylized novel views. Moreover, we introduce a novel flow-based multi-view consistency loss to preserve consistency across multiple views. We evaluate our method across various scenes and artistic styles and show its performance in generating high-quality and multi-view consistent stylized images without the need for a scene-specific implicit model.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13168v1\", \"timestamp\": 1700630675, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"63c40499-022d-487e-a421-59a18e55d098\", \"authors\": [\"Tang Tao\", \"Longfei Gao\", \"Guangrun Wang\", \"Yixing Lao\", \"Peng Chen\", \"Hengshuang Zhao\", \"Dayang Hao\", \"Xiaodan Liang\", \"Mathieu Salzmann\", \"Kaicheng Yu\"], \"title\": \"LiDAR-NeRF: Novel LiDAR View Synthesis via Neural Radiance Fields\", \"abstract\": \"We introduce a new task, novel view synthesis for LiDAR sensors. While traditional model-based LiDAR simulators with style-transfer neural networks can be applied to render novel views, they fall short of producing accurate and realistic LiDAR patterns because the renderers rely on explicit 3D reconstruction and exploit game engines, that ignore important attributes of LiDAR points. We address this challenge by formulating, to the best of our knowledge, the first differentiable end-to-end LiDAR rendering framework, LiDAR-NeRF, leveraging a neural radiance field (NeRF) to facilitate the joint learning of geometry and the attributes of 3D points. However, simply employing NeRF cannot achieve satisfactory results, as it only focuses on learning individual pixels while ignoring local information, especially at low texture areas, resulting in poor geometry. To this end, we have taken steps to address this issue by introducing a structural regularization method to preserve local structural details. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we establish an object-centric multi-view LiDAR dataset, dubbed NeRF-MVL. It contains observations of objects from 9 categories seen from 360-degree viewpoints captured with multiple LiDAR sensors. Our extensive experiments on the scene-level KITTI-360 dataset, and on our object-level NeRF-MVL show that our LiDAR-NeRF surpasses the model-based algorithms significantly.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10406v2\", \"timestamp\": 1682005477, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"96dbf304-a844-4d7e-a6bf-a5957eb1a03a\", \"authors\": [\"Zijiang Yang\", \"Zhongwei Qiu\", \"Chang Xu\", \"Dongmei Fu\"], \"title\": \"MM-NeRF: Multimodal-Guided 3D Multi-Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Field\", \"abstract\": \"3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, and keeps multi-view consistency and style consistency between multimodal guidance.

Obtaining 3D meshes from neural radiance fields still remains an open challenge since NeRFs are optimized for view synthesis, not enforcing an accurate underlying geometry on the radiance field. We thus propose a novel compact and flexible architecture that enables easy 3D surface reconstruction from any NeRF-driven approach.

Although neural radiance field-based techniques are robust for scene reconstruction, their ability to add or remove objects remains limited. This paper proposes a new language-driven approach for object manipulation with neural radiance fields through dataset updates. Specifically, to insert a new foreground object represented by a set of multi-view images into a background radiance field, we use a text-to-image diffusion model to learn and generate combined images that fuse the object of interest into the given background across views. These combined images are then used for refining the background radiance field so that we can render view-consistent images containing both the object and the background. To ensure view consistency, we propose a dataset updates strategy that prioritizes radiance field training with camera views close to the already-trained views prior to propagating the training to remaining views. We show that under the same dataset updates strategy, we can easily adapt our method for object insertion using data from text-to-3D models as well as object removal.

This research could lead to more intuitive tools for artists and designers, enabling rapid prototyping and exploration of artistic ideas. Furthermore, it could bridge the gap between 2D and 3D content generation, fostering innovation in areas such as gaming, virtual reality, and film production.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenges in this area stem from the inherent complexity of 3D representations and the need for consistency across multiple views. Naive approaches may fail due to the difficulty in maintaining texture details and avoiding artifacts during the style transfer process. Additionally, existing methods often require extensive per-scene optimization, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. Overcoming these obstacles requires sophisticated algorithms that can effectively integrate style information while preserving the geometric integrity of the 3D scene.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either 2D style transfer or 3D reconstruction without adequately addressing the unique challenges posed by 3D style transfer.

It can travel through the \npatient's cough or sneeze droplets fro m person to person in close contact. It can even contaminate humans with \neating food in infected copper, plastic, and stainless steel dishes . It should be mentioned out  the COVID\u2010 19 can \nbe live in aforementioned utensils  for several hours  [3]. \nSeveral diagnostic tasks  such as  viral throat swab testing , blood, and serologic tests are conducted for this \ndisease . Also, Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR) is a yardstick from Nasopharyngeal \nSwabs (NS) and Or -pharyngeal Swabs (OS) samples. Nevertheless, these recognition measures do  not only require \nmanual intervention but also are time -consuming process es [2, 9] . Therefore, using  the X-ray or Computed \nTomography (CT) data  is more preferable [10, 11] . These scanning images conspicuously indicate COVID -19 \nviral infections  with higher confidence .

This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample, recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1). Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n\u00a9 S. Hanneke, S. Moran & T. Waknine.arXiv:2403.10889v1  [cs.LG]  16 Mar 2024HANNEKE MORAN WAKNINE\nFigure 1: Amazon recommendation system gives their users a short list of books based on their past reading,\naiming that one of those books will capture their interest.\nbetween finite Daniely-Shwartz (DS) dimension and multiclass learnability. Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1.

We investigate classical principles related to generalization within the context of list learning. Our primary goal is to determine whether classical principles in the PAC setting retain their applicability in the domain of list PAC learning. We focus on uniform convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam's Razor). In classical PAC learning, both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of `completeness': whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres to these principles. We ask whether the same completeness holds true in the list learning setting.   We show that uniform convergence remains equivalent to learnability in the list PAC learning setting. In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\\\\{0,1,2\\\\}$, then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986). We prove an even stronger impossibility result, showing that there are $2$-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed even when the reconstructed function can work with lists of arbitrarily large size. We prove a similar result for (1-list) PAC learnable classes when the label space is unbounded.

In adversarial PAC-learning, an adversary is allowed to replace a test point $x$ with an arbitrary point in a closed ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$. In the tolerant version, the error of the learner is compared with the best achievable error with respect to a slightly larger perturbation radius $(1+\\\\gamma)r$. This simple tweak helps us bridge the gap between theory and practice and obtain the first PAC-type guarantees for algorithmic techniques that are popular in practice.   Our first result concerns the widely-used ``perturb-and-smooth'' approach for adversarial learning.

This research could lead to improved algorithms that better handle label ambiguity and enhance the performance of recommendation systems and other applications that rely on multiple label outputs. By clarifying the applicability of established principles in list learning, this work could inspire new methodologies and frameworks, influencing future research directions and practical implementations in various domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in the complexity of adapting classical PAC learning principles to the list learning framework, where the learner outputs multiple labels instead of a single one. Naive approaches may fail because they do not account for the unique characteristics of list learning, such as the need to manage multiple hypotheses simultaneously and the potential for increased computational complexity. Additionally, proving the equivalence of classical principles in this new context requires rigorous theoretical work and may involve overcoming significant mathematical obstacles.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on traditional PAC learning without systematically exploring its extension to list learning. The lack of a comprehensive framework for list PAC learning has created barriers to understanding how classical principles apply in this context. Existing studies have not fully addressed the nuances of list learning, such as the implications of label ambiguity and the need for multiple outputs. Our approach aims to fill this gap by providing a structured analysis of how these foundational principles can be adapted and applied to list learning.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves a theoretical analysis of list PAC learning, focusing on the adaptation of Empirical Risk Minimization and Occam\u2019s Razor principles. We will conduct experiments using synthetic datasets that simulate various list learning scenarios, measuring performance through metrics such as accuracy and computational efficiency.

Of vast\nand steadily growing importance, the market for RDB management\nsystems alone is expected to exceed $133 billion USD by 2028 [ 56].\nEven so, while the machine learning community has devoted con-\nsiderable attention to predictive tasks involving single tables, or\nso-called tabular modeling tasks [ 21,49,58], thus far efforts to\nwiden the scope to handle multiple tables and RDBs still lags be-\nhind, despite the seemingly enormous potential of doing so.

This reality is an unsurprising\nconsequence of privacy concerns and the typical storage of RDBs\non servers with heavily restrictive access and/or licensing protec-\ntions. With few exceptions (that will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\nspecifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\non the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to produce the provided graphs and features. As for the\nsecond branch, emphasis is placed on tabular model evaluations\nthat preserve the original format of single table data, possibly with\naugmentations collected from auxiliary tables. But here feature\nengineering and table flattening are typically prioritized over ex-\nploiting rich network effects as with GNNs [ 9,14,47,48]. Critically\nthough, currently-available head-to-head comparisons involving\ndiverse candidate approaches representative of both branches on\nun-filtered RDB/multi-table data are insufficient for drawing clear-\ncut conclusions regarding which might be preferable and under\nwhat particular circumstances.\nTo address the aforementioned limitations and help advance\npredictive modeling over RDB data, in Section 2 we first introduce\na generic supervised learning formulation across both inductive\nand transductive settings covering dynamic RDBs as commonly-\nencountered in practice.

We propose a probabilistic generative model called vGraph to learn community membership and node representation collaboratively. Specifically, we assume that each node can be represented as a mixture of communities, and each community is defined as a multinomial distribution over nodes. Both the mixing coefficients and the community distribution are parameterized by the low-dimensional representations of the nodes and communities. We designed an effective variational inference algorithm which regularizes the community membership of neighboring nodes to be similar in the latent space.

To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy and modularity of the detected communities.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273v1\", \"timestamp\": 1728968064, \"domain\": \"cs.SI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"cf0b0025-a450-4aec-b7a8-6a430d125442\", \"authors\": [\"Yunpeng Zhao\"], \"title\": \"A Survey on Theoretical Advances of Community Detection in Networks\", \"abstract\": \"Real-world networks usually have community structure, that is, nodes are grouped into densely connected communities. Community detection is one of the most popular and best-studied research topics in network science and has attracted attention in many different fields, including computer science, statistics, social sciences, among others. Numerous approaches for community detection have been proposed in literature, from ad-hoc algorithms to systematic model-based approaches. The large number of available methods leads to a fundamental question: whether a certain method can provide consistent estimates of community labels. The stochastic blockmodel (SBM) and its variants provide a convenient framework for the study of such problems. This article is a survey on the recent theoretical advances of community detection. The authors review a number of community detection methods and their theoretical properties, including graph cut methods, profile likelihoods, the pseudo-likelihood method, the variational method, belief propagation, spectral clustering, and semidefinite relaxations of the SBM. The authors also briefly discuss other research topics in community detection such as robust community detection, community detection with nodal covariates and model selection, as well as suggest a few possible directions for future research.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07691v1\", \"timestamp\": 1535255539, \"domain\": \"cs.SI\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}], "summary": "**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we effectively develop and evaluate machine learning models that leverage the relational structure of multi-table relational databases (RDBs) for predictive tasks?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial as it addresses a significant gap in the current machine learning landscape, where most research focuses on single-table data. By advancing the ability to model and predict using multi-table RDBs, we can unlock new applications in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and social networks, where data is inherently relational. This research could lead to the development of new benchmarks and methodologies that enhance the understanding of relational data, ultimately influencing future research directions and practical applications in data science and analytics.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to accurately capture and utilize the intricate relationships between multiple tables in RDBs, which often involves high-dimensional data and non-linear interactions. Naive approaches may fail due to the challenges of feature engineering and the risk of losing relational information when flattening data into a single table. Additionally, the lack of established benchmarks for evaluating models on RDBs complicates the development process, as researchers may struggle to assess the effectiveness of their approaches against a standard.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has primarily focused on single-table data or has approached relational data through surrogate benchmarks that do not fully capture the complexities of RDBs. Barriers include privacy concerns that limit access to real-world RDB datasets and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics for multi-table predictive modeling. Our approach aims to fill this gap by proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates relational information directly into the modeling process, thus improving upon existing methods that rely on simplified representations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves developing a generic supervised learning framework that accommodates both inductive and transductive settings for dynamic RDBs. We will utilize a combination of graph neural networks (GNNs) and advanced feature extraction techniques to capture relational information effectively. The dataset will consist of real-world multi-table RDBs, and we will evaluate our models using metrics such as prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against various relational structures.

The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information. The proposed approach\nachieves not only enhanced accuracy in identifying malicious\npayloads, but also pushes the boundaries of current methodolo-\ngies that help distinguish malicious payload types by employing\ntwo different classification heads.\nII.

The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information. The proposed approach\nachieves not only enhanced accuracy in identifying malicious\npayloads, but also pushes the boundaries of current methodolo-\ngies that help distinguish malicious payload types by employing\ntwo different classification heads.\nII. D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata. Similarly, we randomly select an equal number of benign\npayload entries as malicious entries to balance the final dataset.\nThe benign entries are labeled as 0.

DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. The integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection. However, the challenge with the state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches is that they prevent the generalization to unseen attacks embedded in the payloads, prohibiting them from accurately detecting new attacks and transferring knowledge learned from previous attacks to the new attacks with small labeled sample sizes. This paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning and few-shot learning. Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer to learn the embedding of the payloads from a vast amount of unlabeled datasets by masking portions of payloads, leading to a learnt representation that well generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from payloads, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm.

In this paper, we propose Mal2GCN, a robust malware detection model that uses Function Call Graph (FCG) representation of executable files combined with Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to detect Windows malware.

Generating such adversarial variants by the defender is crucial to improving the resistance of DL-based malware detectors against them.

Within AMG research, black-box method has gained more attention than white-box methods. However, most black-box AMG methods require numerous interactions with the malware detectors to generate adversarial malware examples.

Experimental results using 1.2 million Android applications across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families, shows that self-supervised learning can achieve an accuracy of 97% for the binary classification of malware which is higher than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our proposed model is also able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class malware classification of types and family with macro-F1 score of .497 and .491 respectively.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07049v1\", \"timestamp\": 1660549798, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2739c4e6-ec0d-4e9f-a33e-6a7b853f1c5a\", \"authors\": [\"James Lee Hu\", \"Mohammadreza Ebrahimi\", \"Hsinchun Chen\"], \"title\": \"Single-Shot Black-Box Adversarial Attacks Against Malware Detectors: A Causal Language Model Approach\", \"abstract\": \"Deep Learning (DL)-based malware detectors are increasingly adopted for early detection of malicious behavior in cybersecurity.

By converting binary code into images, researchers have shown satisfactory results in applying machine learning to extract features that are difficult to discover manually. Such visualization-based malware detection methods can capture malware patterns from many different malware families and improve malware detection speed. On the other hand, recent research has also shown adversarial attacks against such visualization-based malware detection. Attackers can generate adversarial examples by perturbing the malware binary in non-reachable regions, such as padding at the end of the binary. Alternatively, attackers can perturb the malware image embedding and then verify the executability of the malware post-transformation. One major limitation of the first attack scenario is that a simple pre-processing step can remove the perturbations before classification. For the second attack scenario, it is hard to maintain the original malware's executability and functionality. In this work, we provide literature review on existing malware visualization techniques and attacks against them. We summarize the limitation of the previous work, and design a new adversarial example attack against visualization-based malware detection that can evade pre-processing filtering and maintain the original malware functionality.

Due to its popularity, it attracts many malware attacks. In fact, people have discovered around one million new malware samples per quarter, and it was reported that over 98% of these new malware samples are in fact \\\"derivatives\\\" (or variants) from existing malware families. In this paper, we first show that runtime behaviors of malware's core functionalities are in fact similar within a malware family. Hence, we propose a framework to combine \\\"runtime behavior\\\" with \\\"static structures\\\" to detect malware variants. We present the design and implementation of MONET, which has a client and a backend server module. The client module is a lightweight, in-device app for behavior monitoring and signature generation, and we realize this using two novel interception techniques. The backend server is responsible for large scale malware detection. We collect 3723 malware samples and top 500 benign apps to carry out extensive experiments of detecting malware variants and defending against malware transformation. Our experiments show that MONET can achieve around 99% accuracy in detecting malware variants. Furthermore, it can defend against 10 different obfuscation and transformation techniques, while only incurs around 7% performance overhead and about 3% battery overhead. More importantly, MONET will automatically alert users with intrusion details so to prevent further malicious behaviors.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03312v1\", \"timestamp\": 1481386821, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"424726d2-cdaf-4500-a9b2-97ba97706c0a\", \"authors\": [\"Sachith Seneviratne\", \"Ridwan Shariffdeen\", \"Sanka Rasnayaka\", \"Nuran Kasthuriarachchi\"], \"title\": \"Self-Supervised Vision Transformers for Malware Detection\", \"abstract\": \"Malware detection plays a crucial role in cyber-security with the increase in malware growth and advancements in cyber-attacks.

Improving malware detection systems can significantly enhance cybersecurity measures, leading to better protection against attacks. This research could pave the way for future studies on self-supervised and few-shot learning techniques in cybersecurity, potentially leading to practical applications in real-time threat detection and response.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe complexity arises from the need to accurately identify and classify malware that has not been previously encountered, which requires robust models that can generalize well from limited data. Naive approaches may fail due to the high variability in malware signatures and the potential for adversarial attacks that can evade detection. Additionally, the challenge of balancing model complexity with computational efficiency and the need for extensive pre-processing of data adds to the difficulty.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has often relied on traditional supervised learning methods that require large amounts of labeled data, which is not always available for new malware types. Additionally, many existing solutions do not effectively address the problem of generalization to unseen attacks. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning and few-shot learning, which have not been widely applied in this context, allowing for better adaptation to novel malware types.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves using a transformer-based model trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets, specifically focusing on the payloads of network packets.
