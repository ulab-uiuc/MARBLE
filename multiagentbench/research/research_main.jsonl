A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never, with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\nRecently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three categories of pFL Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate.\nInICLR .\nMcMahan, B.; Moore, E.; Ramage, D.; Hampson, S.; and\ny Arcas, B.

They lack cognitive abilities to assess the\nsemantics of situations, states, and actions of both themselves\nand others, or engage in meaning-oriented, human-level\ndialog. They also struggle to deal with disturbances and\nnovel situations, which limits their adaptability in dynamic\nenvironments. Finally, they fall short of being trusted because\nthey are unable to generate causal explanations of their\nreasoning and action.\nTo serve as trusted partners, robots must be able to:\nreliably collaborate on complex and novel tasks and mis-\nsions; interpret and anticipate teammates’ actions and needs;\ncommunicate with teammates in natural language; learn\nnew skills on the job from language and demonstration;\nexplain their own and others’ decisions and actions; and\nteach teammates through language and demonstration.\nThe HARMONIC framework we present aims to meet\nthese challenges by facilitating the implementation of em-\nbodied robots that can remember, plan, reason, explain, ne-\ngotiate, learn, and teach. Specifically, the architecture enables\nrobots to perform:\n1) physical actions, such as repairing, cleaning and gofer-\ning;\n2) the mental actions needed to emulate human-like be-\nhavior, such as meaning-oriented language processing;\nreasoning about plans, goals, and attitudes; explaining\nthe reasons for their own and others’ actions; and\naccessing and archiving institutional memory (which\nis key to operating in complex environments); and\n3) hybrid actions, such as teaching and learning physical\nand mental actions through natural language and visual\ndemonstration.\n1Authors are with the Cognitive Science Department at\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY , USA. e-mail:\nsanjayovs@ieee.org\nFig. 1.

In HARMONIC, by contrast, the strategic and tactical\nlayer components function independently and interactively.\nMoreover, while we implemented HARMONIC using spe-\ncific cognitive and robotic control systems, this framework\nwas designed to facilitate implementation using any state-\nof-the-art cognitive and robotic system that supports all the\nrequired functionalities.\nWhile basic strategic layer functionality can be imple-\nmented using generalist models [7], including Large Lan-\nguage Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA)\nmodels [8], these cannot support human-level explainability,\nwhich is crucial for establishing trust with humans [9].\nTo ensure explainability, VLAs and LLMs are limited to\nspecific modules and functionalities within the HARMONIC\nframework.

Of vast\nand steadily growing importance, the market for RDB management\nsystems alone is expected to exceed $133 billion USD by 2028 [ 56].\nEven so, while the machine learning community has devoted con-\nsiderable attention to predictive tasks involving single tables, or\nso-called tabular modeling tasks [ 21,49,58], thus far efforts to\nwiden the scope to handle multiple tables and RDBs still lags be-\nhind, despite the seemingly enormous potential of doing so. With\n∗Equal contribution.

This reality is an unsurprising\nconsequence of privacy concerns and the typical storage of RDBs\non servers with heavily restrictive access and/or licensing protec-\ntions. With few exceptions (that will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\nspecifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\non the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to produce the provided graphs and features. As for the\nsecond branch, emphasis is placed on tabular model evaluations\nthat preserve the original format of single table data, possibly with\naugmentations collected from auxiliary tables. But here feature\nengineering and table flattening are typically prioritized over ex-\nploiting rich network effects as with GNNs [ 9,14,47,48]. Critically\nthough, currently-available head-to-head comparisons involving\ndiverse candidate approaches representative of both branches on\nun-filtered RDB/multi-table data are insufficient for drawing clear-\ncut conclusions regarding which might be preferable and under\nwhat particular circumstances.\nTo address the aforementioned limitations and help advance\npredictive modeling over RDB data, in Section 2 we first introduce\na generic supervised learning formulation across both inductive\nand transductive settings covering dynamic RDBs as commonly-\nencountered in practice.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jiménez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); Ståhlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n×n𝑛𝑛n\\times nitalic_n × italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt⁢(c)At𝑐\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj⁢(c,c′)Adj𝑐superscript𝑐′\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At⁢(x,y)At𝑥𝑦\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1⁢(x,x′)subscriptAdj1𝑥superscript𝑥′\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2⁢(y,y′)subscriptAdj2𝑦superscript𝑦′\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [Ståhlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript𝐶2C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k𝑘kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3𝑘3k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript𝐶3C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript𝐶2C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t𝑡titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S𝑆Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t𝑡titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At⁢(S)subscript𝐴𝑡𝑆A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0𝑡0t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t𝑡titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=∞𝑡t=\\inftyitalic_t = ∞, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t𝑡titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort. Crucially, for\nlower values of t𝑡titalic_t,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

A lack of diversity in datasets and models can\nhinder the usefulness of ml in many critical applications, e.g. scientiﬁc discovery. It\nis therefore important to be able to measure diversity.\nMany diversity metrics have been proposed in ML, but these metrics are often\ndomain-speciﬁc and limited in ﬂexibility. These include metrics that deﬁne diversity\nin terms of a reference dataset (Heusel et al., 2017; Sajjadi et al., 2018), a pre-\n1Code for calculating the Vendi Score is available at https://github.com/vertaix/Vendi-Score .\n2trained classiﬁer (Salimans et al., 2016; Srivastava et al., 2017), or discrete features,\nlike n-grams (Li et al., 2016). In this paper, we propose a general, reference-free\napproach that deﬁnes diversity in terms of a user-speciﬁed similarity function.\nOur approach is based on work in ecology, where biological diversity has been\ndeﬁned as the exponential of the entropy of the distribution of species within a\npopulation (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006; Leinster, 2021). This value can be interpreted\nas the effective number of species in the population. To adapt this approach to ML,\nwe deﬁne the diversity of a collection of elements x1, . . . , xnas the exponential of\nthe entropy of the eigenvalues of the n\u0002nsimilarity matrix K, whose entries are\nequal to the similarity scores between each pair of elements. This entropy can be\nseen as the von Neumann entropy associated with K(Bengtsson and ˙Zyczkowski,\n2017), so we call our metric the Vendi Score , for the von Neumann diversity.\nContributions. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n•We extend ecological diversity to ML, and propose the Vendi Score, a metric for\nevaluating diversity in ML. We study the properties of the Vendi Score, which\nprovides us with a more formal understanding of desiderata for diversity.\n•We showcase the ﬂexibility and wide applicability of the Vendi Score, char-\nacteristics that stem from its sole reliance on the sample to be evaluated for\ndiversity and a user-deﬁned similarity function, and highlight the shortcom-\nings of existing metrics used to measure diversity in different domains.\n2 Are We Measuring Diversity Correctly in ML?\nSeveral existing metrics for diversity rely on a reference distribution or dataset.\nThese reference-based metrics deﬁne diversity in terms of coverage of the reference.\nThey assume access to an embedding function–such as a pretrained Inception\nmodel (Szegedy et al., 2016)–that maps samples to real-valued vectors. One example\nof a reference-based metric is Fréchet Inception distance (ﬁd) (Heusel et al., 2017),\nwhich measures the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian distributions, one\nGaussian ﬁt to the embeddings of the reference sample and another one ﬁt to the\nembeddings of the sample to be evaluated for diversity. ﬁd was originally proposed\nfor evaluating image generative adversarial networks (gans) but has since been\napplied to text (Cífka et al., 2018) and molecules (Preuer et al., 2018) using domain-\nspeciﬁc neural network encoders. Sajjadi et al. (2018) proposed a two-metric\nevaluation paradigm using precision and recall, with precision measuring quality\nand recall measuring diversity in terms of coverage of the reference distribution.\nSeveral other variations of precision and recall have been proposed (Kynkäänniemi\net al., 2019; Simon et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020).

While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as “Mentalese”.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental “sentences” is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n“words” and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n∗Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor ✘ Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)✘ ✓ (Patch Concept) ✘ ✘ ✓ (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)✓ ✓\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Table 4 presents the Top-10 most important features\ngenerated by the original dataset, our proposed method, and its feature-centric variants (i.e., TCTO−g).\nWe can first observe that TCTO has reused many high-value sub-transformations, such as node v17\nin Housing Boston and node v30in Wine Quality White. Compared to TCTO−g, the graph-based\nmodel tends to reuse important intermediate nodes, transforming them to generate more significant\nfeatures.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozière et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model’s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model’s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal.

To foster students’ developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students’ difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students’ developing knowledge (Wiley et al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students’ responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et al. 2023; Wilson et al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

With visual understanding as the foundation, it should further be able\nto map natural language instructions to corresponding actions within a given\nUI, execute advanced reasoning, and provide exhaustive details concerning the\nscreens it interacts with. These requirements necessitate the development of a\nvision-language model adept at both referring and grounding in relation to UI\nscreens. Here, referring requires the system to utilize particular regional image\ninformation in the screen input, while grounding involves the model’s capacity\nto identify and denote precise locations on the screen in its outputs.\nExisting approaches are insufficient in fully addressing these key capabilities.\nOn one hand, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like Fer-\nret[53],Shikra[8],andKosmos2[41]demonstratestrongreferringandgrounding\ncapabilities, their scope is mainly restricted to natural images.

Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Modern intrusion detection systems leverage Machine Learning (ML) to correlate net-work features, identify patterns in data and highlight anomalies corresponding to at-tacks. Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a ‘guess password’ and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 – it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment. Thus, at every stage in ML pipeline these explanations make it easier to design and deploy best network intrusion detection system. Figure 2 shows how we can generate explanations for every type of user.

The increasing demand for dermatological care is exacerbated by the low\nperformance of general practitioners when diagnosing skin conditions [Federman et al., 1999], and by the global scarcity\nof expert dermatologists [Feng et al., 2018, Kringos et al., 2015].\nAutomation may help alleviate this problem. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al., 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et al., 2019, Topol, 2019]. A good explanation is\nexpected to be both plausible , i.e. as similar as possible to a human explanation, and faithful , i.e. to accurately represent\nthe inner workings of the network [Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020].\nDifferent mechanisms for explaining ConvNet decisions have been proposed [Simonyan et al., 2014, Selvaraju et al.,\n2017, Ribeiro et al., 2016]. Within the medical imaging literature, the most common explainability Related work\nMachine learning-based dermatological diagnosis systems have been widely investigated, achieving experiments, we use an EfﬁcientNet-B2 [Tan and Le, 2019] ConvNet pre-trained on\nthe ImageNet image recognition dataset [Deng et al., 2009] for feature extraction, with all layers ﬁne-tuned on the\nDermXDB data. Both models were trained for 93 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018],\nthe cosine annealing with warm restarts learning rate scheduler [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016], and a starting learning\nrate of 0.0005. Within the dense block we use linear layers with 64 neurons, dropout layers with 0.2 probability, and\nReLU activations. DermX is trained with \u0015D= 1,\u0015C= 1, while DermX+ uses \u0015D= 1,\u0015C= 1, and\u0015A= 10 .\nFurther information about the hyper-parameters used for training and other implementation details can be found in introduction of a structured ontology for\nthe diagnosis explanations to avoid manual processing of typos and synonyms.\nDiagnosis and explanation ontology Preliminary investigations also highlighted the importance of having a con-\nsistent explanation ontology. After analyzing free-text explanations, they were formalized as an extended list of skin\nlesion characteristics [Nast et al., 2016]. The characteristics set was selected to sufﬁciently explain the six target\ndiseases [Oakley, 2017]. With the help of two senior dermatologists, several other relevant characteristics were added.\nThe resulting set of characteristics was split into non-localizable characteristics (e.g. age or sex), localizable charac-\nteristics (e.g. plaque or open comedo), and additional descriptive terms (e.g. red or well-circumscribed), according\nto the International League of Dermatological Societies’ classiﬁcation [Nast et al., 2016]. Figure 3 illustrates the\nﬁnal DermXDB explanation taxonomy, while more information about the other two types of labels is available in Appendix Tables 18, 19, 20, and 21. DermX performs adequately well on all characteristics. DermX+\nis better at localizing large characteristics, e.g. patches or scales, but performs poorly on smaller characteristics, e.g.\nopen and closed comedones.\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

(2020); Fatemi et al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification Zhao et al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data Garg et al. (2020); Buterez et al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning Zhou et al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et al. (2022), and GT Shi et al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL Zou et al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let’s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability Dai et al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links Lin et al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data Wang et al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model’s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

However, these developments have also raised concerns\namong artists, record companies, and publishing houses. The\npotential for unauthorized synthetic reproductions that closely\nimitate a singer’s voice threatens the commercial value of the\noriginal artists. As society becomes increasingly aware of these\nissues, there is a pressing need to develop accurate methods consider capturing the musical in-\nformation, such as pitch, rhythms, and so on.\n3. SingGraph detection training framework\nThe SingGraph detection training framework, as shown in Fig-\nure 1, consists of two key components: singing voice augmen-\ntation techniques, including RawBoost and Beat matching, and\nthe core SingGraph model. We use Demucs1to separate a\nmixed singing song xinto instrumental xinsand vocal xvoc\ncomponents. Following separation, we apply data augmenta-\ntion to create augmented instrumental x′insand vocal x′voc\ntracks. The SingGraph model then processes these augmented\ninputs to verify whether the input is a genuine singing perfor-\nmance or a fake singing recording.\n3.1. Singing voice augmentation\nTo boost performance, we leverage RawBoost for vocal aug-\nmentation and beat matching for instrumental augmentation.\n3.1.1. Beat matching for instrumental.\nIn this part, we will introduce a data augmentation method\nbased on music domain knowledge. Musical compositions con-\nsist of various elements, including chord progressions, timbre,\nand beats, with beats being essential for setting the musical\nstructure and alignment. In the audio domain, mixup [17] is\na favored augmentation technique that blends pairs of audio\ntracks to expand the training dataset. However, mixing in-\nstrumental and vocal tracks with differing tempos can lead to\na disordered and unattractive outcome. We propose the beat\nmatching for instrumental augmentation to correspond to vo-\ncals as shown in Figure 1-(b). Firstly, we employ a cutting-\nedge beat tracking model ALL-in-one [18] to determine each\nmusic track’s tempo and downbeat map. We then organize each\ntrack into tempo-specific groups. During training, we randomly\nselect an instrumental x′\ninsto replace the original pair instru-\nmental xinsfrom the same tempo group to maintain consis-\ntent tempos. Additionally, we conduct downbeat alignment to\nchoose an appropriate downbeat as the starting point for mixing\nsinging voices. This pre-processing strategy enhances our abil-\nity to choose suitable music data for mixing, creating tracks that\nare harmoniously aligned in terms of tempo and downbeat.\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs3.1.2. RawBoost for vocal.\nWe introduce a trick, inspired by stationary signal-independent\nadditive noise with random coloration. This trick significantly\nboosts speech deepfake detection by RawBoost [13,19]. There-\nfore, it is reasonable to adopt it for vocal augmentation in\nSingFake scenario, as the vocal part of singing also belongs\nto speech. As depicted in Figure 1-(a), the vocal input of the\nmodel, x′voc, is generated by the equation:\nx′\nvoc=xvoc+gsi\nsnr·zsi (1)\nwhere zsirepresents white noise wthat has been processed\nthrough a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, adjusted by a gain\nparameter gsi\nsnrbased on a random signal-to-noise ratio.\n3.2. SingGraph model\nThis section introduces the proposed novel SingGraph model.\nThe SingGraph model, depicted in Figure 1-(c), integrates in-\nstrumental and vocal encoders based on self-supervised learn-\ning (SSL) models with a graph-based back-end model. This\nback-end leverages graph neural networks [20–22], which have\nled to significant advancements in various applications, includ-\ning speaker verification [22] and spoofing detection [3, 20, 23],\nby employing a structure of interconnected nodes and edges.\nIt encompasses components for aggregating singing voice fea-\ntures, modeling\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Notably, Statistics\nplays a crucial role in the development of these AGI products. A fundamental statistical\nproblem involved is how to generate samples efficiently following a learned high-dimensional\nconditional distribution (Liu et al., 2024; Esser et al., 2024).\nIntuitively, to solve this fundamental statistical problem, we can first estimate the con-\nditional distribution and then generate samples from the obtained estimation. A wealth\nof classical literature has already delved into nonparametric conditional distribution esti-\nmation, including smoothing discussion, which establishes the validity of Al-\ngorithm 1 in sampling data from px|y(x|y), and also highlights the effectiveness of the\nconditional F¨ ollmer flow in sampling from the target conditional density.\nTheorem 2 Let Assumptions 1–3hold.

We choose the hypothesis network class FNN = FNN( L, M, J, K, κ, γ 1, γ2, γ3)\nas specified in Proposition 2and then use ˆv(x,y, t)in(7)to estimate the true velocity field\nvF(x,y, t).

The proof of Proposition P1 can be found in Section C.\nProposition P1 Let Assumptions 1and2hold. The following two assertions are satisfied:\n(i)There exists some universal constant C >1independent of (dx, R, T )such that\nsup\nt∈[0,T]sup\nx∈[−R,R]dxsup\ny∈[0,B]dy|vF(x,y, t)|∞≤1 +TR\n1−T2,\nS1sup\nt∈[0,T]sup\nx∈[−R,R]dxsup\ny∈[0,B]dy|∂tvF(x,y, t)|2≤Cd3/2\nx(R+ 1)\n(1−T)3,\nfor any R >0andT∈(0,1).\n(ii)For any y∈[0, B]dyandt∈[0, T]with T∈(0,1),vF(x,y, t)isdx(1−T)−2-\nLipschitz continuous w.r.t. x, while Ft(x,y)isexp{dx(1−T)−2}-Lipschitz continuous\nw.r.t. x.\nA Proof of Theorem 1\nWe will establish our proof of Theorem 1 through the following three steps.\nStep 1. For any given yandε∈(0,1), we show the existence of a diffusion process\n(¯Zy\nt)t∈[0,1−ε]determined by an Itˆ o SDE, which can approximately transform the target\nconditional density px|y(x|y) into the density of standard Gaussian distribution N(0,Idx),\nand then there exists a process ( ˇZy\nt)t∈[δ,1−ε]determined by the associated ODE with any\nδ∈(0,1) satisfying δ <1−ε, such that ˇZy\ntshares the same marginal density with ¯Zy\ntfor\nanyt∈[δ,1−ε].\nStep 2. Under Assumption 2, we can extend the domain of the ODE involved in\nStep 1 to the interval [ δ,1] by supplementing its definition at t= 1, ensuring an accurate\ntransformation into the density of standard Gaussian distribution N(0,Idx).\nStep 3. Under Assumptions 2, we can prove that the ODE involved in Step 2 has\na unique solution. Hence, we can time reverse it to obtain the conditional F¨ ollmer flow\n(1) over [0 ,1−δ] and further extend it to [0 ,1) by letting δ→0. This establishes the\nwell-posedness of the conditional F¨ ollmer flow and its ability to arbitrarily approach the\ntarget conditional density px|y(x|y) from the density of the standard Gaussian distribution\nN(0,Idx).\nS2A.1 Step 1\nFor any given yandε∈(0,1), we consider a diffusion process ( ¯Zy\nt)t∈[0,1−ε]defined\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces (Hoja et al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network’s predictions unreliable (Stocker et al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into ‘physical-informed’ and ‘application-focused’ desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n•\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

GNNs have shown to be\neffective in addressing a variety of real-world applications such as\nfraud detection [ 18,47,74], recommendation systems [ 61,71,72],\npredicting molecular and protein structure [ 29,57], knowledge\n1Accepted in KDD’23. DOI: 10.1145/3580305.3599843representation [ 15], and more recently helping in fine-tuning large\nlanguage models [ 73]. Their popularity has led to the development\nof various optimized frameworks and libraries [ 19,63,76] that\nenable the fast application of GNNs on new domains, making it\neasier for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of\nGNNs in their work.\nHowever, high-quality frameworks and libraries are necessary\nbut not sufficient for enabling fast research progress in GNN. One\nof the major challenges in GNN research is the lack of large-scale\ndatasets. This is because large graph datasets are typically propriety\nand most publicly available ones are rather small. The small size\nof these datasets makes it difficult to train GNNs that can handle\nlarge-graph structures and prevents the use of powerful pre-training\ntechniques [ 16,32,59,65]. These challenges make it difficult to fully\nleverage GNN potential and its applications.\nTo address these challenges, recent work such as OGBN and\nMAG [ 26,27] have proposed open large graph benchmark suites\nproviding up to 244 million nodes and 1.7 billion edge graphs. These\ndatasets contain a diverse set of graphs and have been widely used\nin the research community to benchmark GNNs’ performance. How-\never, most existing datasets, including OGBN, provide very limited\nlabeled data. As GNN downstream tasks are often trained as super-\nvised learning tasks, having large labeled data matters, especially\nfor multi-label classification problems.

Thus, the datasets for SRS evalu-\nation should be analyzed to determine the presence of such patterns.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no well-established criteria\nto assess how good the dataset is for SRS evaluation. In our work,\nwe aim to highlight the importance of determining the strength of\nsequential patterns during dataset selection and propose criteria\nfor such assessment.\nWe propose to use three approaches to analyze the strength of\nsequential patterns. These approaches are based on the assumption\nthat the sequential patterns in the dataset will be broken if the in-\nteractions in user sequences are shuffled in random order. Thus, we\ncan estimate the strength of the sequential structure by comparing\nchosen metrics acquired on shuffled and unshuffled versions of\ndata.\nThe first approach, based on identifying sequential rules, is sim-\nple and model-agnostic.

The RELATED WORK\n2.1 Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nVisual language models demonstrate strong performance across\na range of visual tasks and possess powerful generalization ca-\npabilities, such as CLIP[ 29], a model trained on a vast dataset of\ntext-image pairs through contrastive learning. This approach has\nsince inspired a plethora of visual language models that employ sim-\nilar training methodologies. The pre-trained CLIP model acquires\nthe ability to represent images and text in a shared feature space\nthrough contrastive learning. These image-text representations de-\nrived from CLIP can be utilized for downstream tasks like semantic\nsegmentation and object detection. Notably, CLIP demonstrates\nthe capability to handle zero-shot classification in these tasks by\nemploying class prompts in the form of \"A photo of <CLASS>.\"\n2.2 VLMs’ Adaptation\nInspired by the zero-shot ability of CLIP, subsequent work aims to\nimprove its performance. The ability of CLIP to handle zero-shot\nclassification in downstream tasks is influenced by the data distri-\nbution of those tasks. Many researchers have proposed Methods.

Take one of\nthe most successful model series, the OpenAI’s GPT models, as an example: the original GPT-3\nmodel released in 2020 [ 3] marked a significant scale-up from GPT-1’s 117 million parameters and\nGPT-2’s 1.5 billion parameters, to 175 billion parameters. This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11] featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B. Later, ChatGPT further motivated us\nto align the base models with SFT and RLHF. We created and crafted the prompt-response pairs from\nscratch and performed SFT, while also starting to examine how to effectively apply RLHF.

however, it requires 3D observations, such as 3D scans or RGBD images with highly accurate SMPL-X registrations, with diverse poses and facial expressions.\nSuch an assumption does not hold for the majority of casually captured videos in daily life.\n\n\nFigure 1: \nFrom (a) a monocular video from a single person, we create our (b) ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body 3D avatar, animatable with novel facial expression code, hand poses, and body poses of SMPL-X.\n\n\n\nWe present ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body 3D human avatar that can be made from a short monocular video.\nExAvatar is designed as a combination of the whole-body 3D parametric model (SMPL-X) [37] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [22].\nIt utilizes the whole-body drivability of SMPL-X and the photorealistic and efficient rendering capability of 3DGS.\nAfter the training, it is animatable with novel facial expression code and 3D pose of SMPL-X, as shown in Fig. 1.\nDespite its desired properties, modeling ExAvatar is an non-trivial task with the following two challenges: 1) a limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD videos.\nThe limited diversity in the video makes a drivability with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial.\nIn addition, the absence of 3D observations creates ambiguity in the occluded human parts, exhibiting noticeable artifacts in novel facial expressions and poses.\n\n\nTo address them, we propose a novel hybrid representation of the surface mesh and 3D Gaussians in ExAvatar.\nOur hybrid representation treats each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface, where the vertices have pre-defined connectivity (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology of SMPL-X.\nExisting volumetric avatars [39, 38, 25, 8, 6, 20, 15, 19, 47] do not have the connectivity by the definition.\nAlso, previous 3DGS-based [24, 18] works consider a set of 3D Gaussian points as a point cloud without considering the connectivity between them.\n\n\nUsing our hybrid representation, our\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The research integrating LLMs with\nvarious disciplines, i.e., LLM+X, such as math, science, finance, healthcare, law, etc., is starting as a new\nepoch powered by collaborative endeavors spanning diverse communities. In this survey paper, we offer an\nexploration of the methodologies, applications, challenges, ethics, and future opportunities of LLMs within\ncritical societal domains , including finance, healthcare , andlaw. These domains are major cornerstones\nof societal function and well-being, each playing a critical role in the fabric of daily life and the broader\neconomic and social systems. They are frequently discussed together due to shared characteristics, including\nthereliance on extensive professional expertise ,highly confidential data ,extensive multimodal documents ,high\nlegal risk and strict regulations , and the requirement for explainability and fairness.\nReliance on Professional Expertise. These domains require extensive professional knowledge and\nexperience. The finance domain involves complex financial analysis, investment strategies, and economic\nforecasting, necessitating deep knowledge of financial theories, market behavior, and fiscal policy (Benninga,\n2014; Fridson & Alvarez, 2022; Roberts, 1959; Geels, 2013; Franses, 1998; Easterly & Rebelo, 1993). Healthcare\nrequires specialized knowledge in medical sciences, patient care, diagnostics, and treatment planning, and\nprofessionals are trained for years in their specific fields (Melnick et al., 2002; Gowda et al., 2014; P. Collins,\n1998; Brauer & Ferguson, 2015; Thomas et al., 2022). The legal domain demands a thorough understanding\nof legal principles, statutes, case law, and judicial procedures, with practitioners spending extensive periods\nin legal education and training (Hart & Green, 2012; Dworkin, 1986; Sunstein, 2018; Epstein & Sharkey, 2020;\nFriedman, 2005; Chemerinsky, 2023; MacCormick, 1994).The need for profound professional expertise in these\ndomains presents significant challenges in equipping LLMs with the requisite knowledge and capabilities (Li\net al., 2023d; Xie et al., 2024b; Islam et al., 2023; Nori et al., 2023a;b; Tan et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2022; Choi\net al., 2021; Iu & Wong, 2023).\nHighly Confidential Data. Unlike many other domains where data might be more public or less sensitive,\nfinance, healthcare, and law deal with information that is mostly personal and confidential. This brings\nunique challenges for LLM-based research, which is essentially data-driven. LLMs must be trained and tested\nin a manner that prevents data breaches or inadvertent disclosures. This necessitates research challenges\nsuch as training data synthesis, encryption techniques, secure data handling practices, transfer learning, etc.\nExtensive Multimodal Documents. The complexity and multimodal nature of documents in these\nsectors mark another unique challenge. Financial documents may contain not only text but also tables\nand charts in diverse structures (Chen et al., 2021b; Bhatia et al., 2024). Healthcare data may contain\ntext and various medical imaging modalities Gee et al. (2004); Wood et al. (2020); Yan et al. (2023c),\nsuch as X-ray Radiography, Ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI).

In such contexts, their black-box nature is a major\nconcern, and explainability Background and Related Work\nLocal explanations. The overwhelming majority of deep\nlearning based models are designed without explainability\nin mind, with only a few notable exceptions [8, 64]. This\nfact has prompted an interest in post-hoc explanations of\nalready trained models that can be useful to analyze cor-\nner cases, understand failures, and find biases [15, 40].\nIn safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving or\nmedical imaging, explanations are especially needed for li-\nability purposes and to foster end-user trust [45, 49, 62, 65].\nPost-hoc explanations are global if they provide a holis-\ntic view of the main decision factors driving the model\n[18, 21, 32, 33], or they are local if they target the under-\nstanding of the model behavior on a specific input [40, 44].\nHistorically, the vast majority of local explanation meth-\nods are attribution-based: they generate saliency maps high-lighting pixels or regions influencing the most the model’s\ndecision [5, 16, 39, 44, 47, 53, 56, 63, 67]. In the case of ur-\nban scenes, a saliency method would for instance point at\nthe traffic light, or the presence of a pedestrian to explain\nwhy a driving model stops [31, 43]. However, saliency ex-\nplanations may be misleading as they can be independent\nof the model at hand and merely act as edge detectors [3].\nBesides, saliency results are very counter-intuitive because one would expect that\n’can’t turn right” should be the answer if there is a car or an obstacle\non the right (not on the left)\nbecause the right lane is occupied The presence of a double yellow line on the right prohibits turning right I did not understand many examples where there was no double line and\nwhere the right lane seemed clear and where, however, turning right was\nprohibited.\nCan’t turn right when front vehicle is close and when there is a car on\ntheleftor on the rightInflucene the decision : Yellow line, distance with the front car, position\nof vehicles on the right or on the left.The model does not consider the lateral space on the right side.\nThe car in front is too close, and there is a car on the right To be able to overtake, we must not have cars overtaking us, nor cars that\nare too close, if possible good general visibility, in particular lines.No\nThere is a car too the right which is close.

For ex-\nample, in medical imaging, models trained on the data from one institution may\nnot generalize well to another institution with different imaging hardware. Sim-\nilarly, in battery capacity monitoring, models trained on lab-collected data may\nperform poorly under diverse operation environments. Obtaining the annotation\nfor the new domains, however, is often very costly or infeasible. To address this\n⋆Hanbing Liu, Jingge Wang, Xuan Zhang, and Yang Li are from the Shenzhen Key\nLaboratory of Ubiquitous Data Enabling, SIGS, Tsinghua University.arXiv:2402.16681v2  [cs.LG]  18 Mar 20242 Hanbing Liu et al.\nchallenge, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been proposed, lever-\naging the labeled data from the source domain to improve the performance of\nlearning models on the unlabeled target domain [5]. In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless, one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT) [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata. As a divergence measurement\nthat takes into account the geometry of the data distributions, Wasserstein dis-\ntance (w-distance) [15] plays an important role in deriving the generalization\nbound in domain adaptation, which implies\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections, with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13]. Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models, including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19] have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model’s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to a framework based\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Subsequently, we present compar-\nisons to existing models with quantitative metrics and hu-\nman evaluation in Sec. 5.2. We then showcase qualitative Results\nC.1. Evidence Behind the Core idea & intuition\nAs stated in eDiff-I [1], diffusion models synthesize se-\nmantics during early denoising stages and refine image de-\ntails in later stages. As depicted in Figure 6, we also observe\nthat semantic deviations and object repetitions commonly\nencountered at higher resolutions primarily stem from in-\ncorrect semantics generated during early denoising, leading\nto irreparable errors. Thus, our intuition and insight hereare: perform early denoising at the original resolution to\ngenerate accurate semantic information, followed by trun-\ncate andrelay to continue denoising at higher resolutions,\nthereby enriching texture details. This enables MegaFu-\nsion to produce high-quality, semantically accurate higher-\nresolution images with lower computational costs, while\nsupporting arbitrary aspect ratios.\nC.2. Disadvantages of Direct Upsampling\nCompared to our MegaFusion for higher-resolution im-\nage generation, a more straightforward approach is to di-\nrectly apply upsampling to images generated by diffusion\nmodels.

A V is a complex system integrating a\npipeline of modules such as perception of obstacles, plan-\nning of driving behaviors, and controlling of the physical\nvehicle [1, 3]. Specifically, trajectory prediction in the per-\nception module predicts the future trajectories of nearby\nmoving objects. The prediction is essential for the plan-\nning module and affects A V’s driving behavior. Therefore,\naccurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe A V driving.\nMany studies propose trajectory prediction models based\non deep neural networks [8, 10, 11, 13, 21, 23, 24, 27, 32, 33,\n35, 38, 41, 42]. They evaluate the models on benchmarks\ncollected from real world using the average ℓ2distance be-\ntween ground truth and predicted trajectories as the key\nmetric. However, few studies evaluate trajectory prediction\nmodels from the perspective of security or analyze the ro-\nbustness against adversarial examples. For trajectory pre-\ndiction, if the adversary can control the position of a vehi-\ncle close to the target A V , e.g., by driving the vehicle along\na crafted trajectory, the adversary can influence the A V’s\ntrajectory prediction and driving behaviors.To bridge this gap, we propose new white/black box ad-\nversarial attacks on trajectory prediction, which adds minor\nperturbation on normal trajectories to maximize the pre-\ndiction error. Compared with adversarial attacks on im-\nage/video classification, attacking trajectory prediction is\nunique in two aspects. First, the attack requires natural-\nness [40] of the adversarial examples. Adversarial trajec-\ntories are natural if they obey physical rules and are possi-\nble to happen in the real world. With naturalness, the tra-\njectories can be reproduced by the attacker-controlled ve-\nhicle in the real world and cannot be easily classified as\nanomaly by A Vs. To realize naturalness, we enforce con-\nstraints on physical properties (e.g., velocity and accelera-\ntion) of the perturbed trajectory during optimization solv-\ning. Second, we need to define optimization objectives that\nare semantically-attractive for attackers targeting trajectory\nprediction. To this end, we find multiple attractive attack\ndimensions can co-exist even for the same scenario (e.g.,\ncausing the predicted trajectory to deviate laterally or lon-\ngitudinally are both of interest to attackers in A V context).\nThus, in our attack design we consider different metrics of\nprediction error as optimization objectives, e.g., average lat-\neral/longitudinal deviation to four different directions.\nWe evaluate the proposed attacks on 10 different com-\nbinations of prediction models [18, 20, 30] and trajectory\ndatasets [2,5,16]. The results.\nE. Attack Real-world A V System\nOur attack is effective on real A V software, Baidu Apollo\n6.0 [3], which uses an LSTM predictor on 2 seconds of his-\ntory trajectory in a frequency of 10 Hz. Figure 13 shows\nthat the adversarial trajectory spoofs fake lane changing (in\nthe left figure), resulting in a brake of the right Apollo A V\n(in LGSVL simulator [28]). Second, history length and fre-\nquency are system-specific settings, and prediction models\nmostly choose 2-3 seconds of history and 2-10 Hz. Al-\nthough we showed different values for the two parameters\nin Tab.1, we did not observe a clear correlation between the\nparameters and prediction accuracy. We can openly discuss\nthis question as future work. methods, which require parameters about\nevolution speed and maximum iterations. When tuning the\nparameters, we monitor the objective loss over time. The\nparameters are proper if the loss is overall decreasing and\nstays low stably in\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Since anomalous sounds can indicate system error or malicious activities, ASD has received much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely used in various applications, such as road surveillance [6, 7], animal disease detection [8], and industrial equipment predictive maintenance [9]. Recently, ASD has also been used to monitor the abnormality of industrial machinery equipment, such as anomaly detection for surface-mounted device machine [10, 11], and the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge Task2 from 2020 to 2023 [12, 13, 14, 15], to reduce the loss caused by machine damage and the cost of manual inspection.\n\n\nSupervised learning based methods usually train a binary classifier to detect the anomaly [7, 16]. However, it is hard to collect enough anomalous data for supervised learning, as actual anomalous sounds rarely occur in real scenarios. In addition, the high diversity of the anomalies can reduce the robustness of supervised methods. Therefore, unsupervised methods are often employed to detect unknown anomalous sounds without using anomalous sound samples.\n\n\nIn unsupervised ASD, a method is to employ the autoencoder (AE) to learn the distributions of sound signals and perform anomaly detection. Conventional AE-based approaches adopt autoencoder to reconstruct multiple frames of spectrogram to learn the distribution of normal sounds, and then the reconstruction error is used to obtain the anomaly score for anomaly detection [10, 12, 17, 18, 19]. However, the conventional AE-based methods do not work well for non-stationary ASD [20], as non-stationary normal sounds (e.g., sound signals of valves) can easily have larger reconstruction errors than abnormal sounds, thus deteriorating the detection performance. In [20], an interpolation deep neural network (IDNN) method is proposed, which masks the center frame of the input, and only uses the reconstruction error of the masked center frame to improve non-stationary sound reconstruction, without considering the edge frames. While the method in [21] adopts a similar strategy as IDNN, and applies the local area mask on the input and employs attentive neural process (ANP) [22] for the reconstruction of the masked input.\n\n\nInstead of reconstructing spectrogram feature, the method in [23] mixes multiple features as the input, and adopts a fully connected U-Net for the mixed feature reconstruction. To utilize the intra-frame statistics of sound signal, a novel group masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (Group MADE) is proposed for unsupervised ASD [24, 25], which estimates the density of an audio time series and achieves better performance. However, the distributions of normal audio clips from different machines are different even for the same sound class. This difference can be even greater than that between normal and anomalous sound, which makes it harder to distinguish normal and anomalous sounds for these purely AE-based methods, as the learned feature from these normal sounds may also fit with the anomalous sounds [26].\n\n\nMachine identity (ID) has been used as the additional condition for encoding in the latent feature space of AE, in order to allow the decoder to provide different reconstructions for each machine [27, 28]. However, the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

For instance, in image classification, translating an\nimage by a few pixels (Azulay & Weiss, 2019) or modifying\nthe background spurious correlations. We hypothesize\nthat because of this, on CMNIST and CelebA (Table 1),\nwhere concepts are less spatially separable, our method’s\nbenefit is a bit limited compared to other datasets like Water-\nbirds, Urban Cars, Bar (Nam et al., 2020) (Table 6), whereconcepts have clear spatial regions. Further investigation in\nthis direction is needed. In principle, one could try to learn a\ndisentangled representation of the high level objects and use\nthe disentangled factors of variations as concept. Work like\nSingh et al. (2022) that further factorizes the representation\nof each semantic region can be used to mitigate this issue by\nallowing one spatial region to be represented as a collection\nof concepts.\n4.2.7. A VOIDING REPRESENTATION COLLAPSE\nOur concept discovery method is based on self-supervised\nSiamese representation learning, utilizing two parallel en-\ncoders: the student produces the source slot encoding and\nthe teacher produces the target encoding. One of the main\nissues with this kind of encoder-only learning framework is\nrepresentation collapse (Hua et al., 2021). During training,\nour method can obtain a degenerate solution in which all\nrepresentations of the slots fall into one cluster, while still\nminimizing the objective in Equation 5.\nTo avoid this degenerate case, we employ a similar set of\nideas as DINO (Caron et al., 2021) to have asymmetric\nteacher and student branches: 1) using data augmentations\nof teacher and student views; 2) centering and sharpening\nof teacher slot distributions; 3) updating teacher weights by\ntaking an exponential moving average of student. Typically,\nthe teacher model’s weights are updated after every gradient\nupdate step for most datasets. However, for the CMNIST\ndatasets, data augmentation is not used. To maintain the\nasymmetry between the teacher and student models in the\nabsence of data augmentation, the updates for the CMNIST\ndatasets are performed less frequently, specifically after\nevery 20 steps.\n5. related work in Section 2).

We introduce CoBalT, a method\ncombining concept discovery with concept balancing for\nrobust classification.

First-order (FO) optimizers, e.g., SGD (Amari,\n1993) and Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), have been the pre-\ndominant choices for LLM fine-tuning. However, as LLMs\ncontinue to scale, they encounter significant memory over-\nhead due to the back-propagation (BP) required for FO gra-\ndient computation. For example, computing the gradient of\nthe LLM OPT-13B requires 12×more memory cost than\nthe model inference. This leads to the challenge of achiev-\ningmemory-efficient fine-tuning in LLMs. Advancements in\naddressing this challenge could also facilitate technological\nbreakthroughs in related areas, such as on-device training,\nwhere memory efficiency is in high demand (Han et al.,\n2015; Zhu et al., 2023).\nTo enhance memory efficiency, an emerging solution is to\nreplace a BP-required FO optimization method with a BP-\nfreeoptimizer during LLM fine-tuning. This was initially\nproposed by Malladi et al. (2023), where the FO gradient\nis approximated using a finite difference of function values.\nDespite its new application to LLM fine-tuning, the under-\nlying optimization principle used in Malladi et al. (2023) is\ncommonly known as zeroth-order (ZO) optimization , and\nthe function value-based gradient estimate is referred to as\nthe ZO gradient estimate (Flaxman et al., 2005; Nesterov &\nSpokoiny, 2017; Duchi et al., 2015; Ghadimi & Lan, 2013;\nLiu et al., 2020). Malladi et al. (2023) employed the clas-\nsical ZO stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD) algorithm\n(Ghadimi & Lan, 2013), termed MeZO, to fine-tune the\npre-trained LLMs and leveraged the BP-free characteris-\ntics of ZO optimization to reduce memory costs. However,\nfrom the perspective of ZO optimization, in addition to ZO-\nSGD, many other ZO optimization Related Work\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Early ef-\nforts (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020) involved\ninserting trainable adapters, which are compact feed-\nforward networks, between the layers of the pre-trained\nmodel. More recently, various PEFT strategies have been\nproposed. For instance, Adapter -based background, the RGE ˆ∇f(x)can be inter-\npreted as an approximation of the FO gradient ∇f(x)using\nthe directional derivative.\nForward gradient: A missing BP-free baseline in LLM\nfine-tuning. As a byproduct of connecting RGE to (1),\n3Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark\nwe obtain the directional derivative-based gradient estimate,\n∇f(x)≈f′(x,u)u, which is known as the forward gradi-\nent(Forward-Grad ) (Baydin et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2022).\nDifferent from RGE that relies solely on the finite differ-\nence of function values, Forward-Grad requires the use of\nforward mode automatic differentiation (AD) but eliminates\nthe need for backward evaluation in the implementation of\ndeep model fine-tuning or training. In other words, Forward-\nGrad is BP-free and can serve as another alternative gradient\nestimation method that improves the memory efficiency of\nLLM fine-tuning. We stress that Forward-Grad is a possibly\noverlooked BP-free optimizer.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Nevertheless, the quantity \nof data remains decisive for the quality of a supervised classifier. Originating from the field of computer vision, many \ndifferent conclusion for this survey.  3 2 BACKGROUND: FOUNDATIONS, GOALS, AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA AUGMENTATION  \nIn many machine learning scenarios, not enough data is available to train a high -quality classifier. To a ddress this \nproblem, data augmentation can be used. It artificially enlarges the amount of available training data by means of \ntransformations [7]. In the well-known LeNet by LeCun et al. [8], early versions of data augmentation have already been \nobserved . The notion of data augmentation comprises various research in different sub -areas of machine learning. Many \nscientific works merely relate data augmentation to deep learning, yet it is frequently applied in the entire context of \nmachine learning. Therefore, this paper a dopts the notion of data augmentation as a broad concept, encompassing any \nmethod that enables the transformation of training data. However, following common understanding in research, semi -\nsupervised learning is not regarded as a form of data augmentation  and is only thematized if sensible in this survey.  \nAn important term relating to  data augmentation is label preservation, which describes transformations of training \ndata that preserve class information [9]. For exa mple, i n sentiment analysis, an entity replacement within a sentence is \noften sufficient for label preservation , but randomly adding  words may alter the sentiment (e.g., an additional “not” \ncould invert the meaning of a sentence). In many research works, l abel preservation is adapted to also cover \ntransformations changing the class information , if the label is adjusted correctly. Additionally, many transformations do \nnot maintain the correct  class  in every case , but with a high probability. Shorten and Khoshgoftaar [5] define this \nprobability as the safety of a data augmentation method. When this uncertainty is known, it could be directly integrated \nin the label. Otherwise, conclusions. T he benchmark should not be too large, in order to ensure specific evaluations can \nstill be carried out . Researchers that try to develop such a benchmark, could also consider to specify how much data \naugmentation should be performed  and what models should be used.  When determining which model should be used , it \nmight be useful to create an updatable benchmark, as proposed by Gehrmann et al [157] , which can be modified \naccording to more recent state -of-the-art models.  \n4.4 Enhancing the Understanding  of Text  Data Augmentation   \nShorten and  Khoshgoftaar  [5] highlight that  while  for some image data augmentation techniques it is easy to understand \nhow they might improve the dataset and derived classifiers , however , for other techniques  this improvement has not \nbeen  explainable  yet. This also applies to the text regime, where for example, data augmentation results in a continuity \nproblem of learning, so that, e.g., the encoder\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

As can be seen readily, the un-\nderlying architecture is a Generate-Test-Critique loop, with\nthe LLM generating candidate plans and a bank of critics\ncritiquing the candidate.

The\nframework also recognizes that LLMs are good at for-\nmat/syntax changes. Accordingly, the framework lever-\nages all these abilities of LLMs, letting them play multiple\nroles in planning. Finally, the architecture carefully circum-\nscribes the human’s role–domain experts interact with the\nLLM to tease out the models used by (some of) the critics,\nwhile end users take part in refining any incomplete prob-\n7The name LLM-Modulo is inspired by the SAT-Modulo theo-\nries (Nieuwenhuis & Oliveras, 2006).\n8Although we focus on planning from scratch, it is easy to\naccommodate replanning scenarios, where the loop starts with an\nexternally supplied candidate plan.lem specification in concert with the LLM.

The sequence modeling chapter in the canonical\ntextbook on deep learning is titled “Sequence Modeling:\nRecurrent and Recursive Nets” (Goodfellow et al., 2016),\ncapturing the common association of sequence modeling\nand recurrent architectures. A well-regarded recent online\ncourse on “Sequence Models” focuses exclusively on recur-\nrent architectures (Ng, 2018).\n1Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon Univer-\nsity, Pittsburgh, PA, USA2Computer Science Department,\nCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA3Intel Labs,\nSanta Clara, CA, USA.

Zico Kolter <zkolter@cs.cmu.edu >,\nVladlen Koltun <vkoltun@gmail.edu >.On the other hand, recent research indicates that certain con-\nvolutional architectures can reach state-of-the-art accuracy\nin audio synthesis, word-level language modeling, and ma-\nchine translation (van den Oord et al., 2016; Kalchbrenner\net al., 2016; Dauphin et al., 2017; Gehring et al., 2017a;b).\nThis raises the question of whether these successes of con-\nvolutional sequence modeling are conﬁned to speciﬁc ap-\nplication domains or whether a broader reconsideration of\nthe association between sequence processing and recurrent\nnetworks is in order.\nWe address this question by conducting a systematic empiri-\ncal evaluation of convolutional and recurrent architectures\non a broad range of sequence modeling tasks. We specif-\nically target a comprehensive set of tasks that have been\nrepeatedly used to compare the effectiveness of different\nrecurrent network architectures. These tasks include poly-\nphonic music modeling, word- and character-level language\nmodeling, as well as synthetic stress tests that had been de-\nliberately designed and frequently used to benchmark RNNs.\nOur evaluation is thus set up to compare convolutional and\nrecurrent approaches to sequence modeling on the recurrent\nnetworks’ “home turf”.\nTo represent convolutional networks, we describe a generic\ntemporal convolutional network (TCN) architecture that is\napplied across all tasks. This architecture is informed by\nrecent research, but is deliberately kept simple, combining\nsome of the best practices of modern convolutional archi-\ntectures. It is compared to canonical recurrent architectures\nsuch as LSTMs and GRUs.\nThe Background\nConvolutional networks (LeCun et al., 1989) have been\napplied to sequences for decades (Sejnowski & Rosen-\nberg, 1987; Hinton, 1989). They were used prominently\nfor speech recognition in the 80s and 90s (Waibel et al.,\n1989; Bottou et al., 1990). ConvNets were subsequently\napplied to NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and\nsemantic role labelling (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Col-\nlobert et al., 2011; dos Santos & Zadrozny, 2014). More\nrecently, convolutional networks were applied to sentence\nclassiﬁcation (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014) and\ndocument classiﬁcation (Zhang et al., 2015; Conneau et al.,\n2017; Johnson & Zhang, 2015; 2017). Particularly inspiring\nfor our work are the recent applications of convolutional\narchitectures to machine translation (Kalchbrenner et al.,\n2016; Gehring et al., 2017a;b), audio synthesis (van den\nOord et al., 2016), and language modeling (Dauphin et al.,\n2017).\nRecurrent networks are dedicated sequence models that\nmaintain a vector of hidden activations that are propagated\nthrough time (Elman, 1990; Werbos, 1990; Graves, 2012).\nThis family of architectures has gained tremendous pop-\nularity due to prominent applications to language mod-\neling (Sutskever et al., 2011; Graves, 2013; Hermans &\nSchrauwen, 2013) and machine translation (Sutskever et al.,\n2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). The intuitive appeal of re-\ncurrent modeling is that the hidden state can act as a rep-\nresentation of everything that has been seen so far in the\nsequence. Basic RNN architectures are notoriously difﬁcult\nto train (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al.,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The research started about four decades ago when Takens [1]\nproved that the underlying dynamical system can be faithfully reconstructed from time series\nwith a one-to-one correspondence between the reconstructed and the true but unknown\ndynamical systems. From the reconstructed system, statistical quantities characterizing the\ndynamical invariant set of the original system can be assessed [3, 4]. For example, from\ntime series, the fractal dimensions of the underlying chaotic attractor can be estimated [5{\n12], as well as the Lyapunov exponents [13{19] and some unstable periodic orbits [20{25].\nThe continuity and di\u000berentiability of the original dynamical system can be tested [26{30].\nPractical issues on determining the basic parameters of delay-coordinate embedding such\nas the proper time delay [11, 12, 31{36] and the embedding dimension [37] were addressed.\nThe Takens' paradigm was also extended to dynamical systems in the regime of transient\nchaos [38{43] and to systems with a time delay [44].\nThere were previous DISCUSSION\nThe principle of exploiting sparse optimization such as compressive sensing to \fnd the\nequations of nonlinear dynamical systems from data was \frst articulated [78] in 2011. The\nbasic idea is to expand the equations (the velocity \feld for a continuous time dynamical sys-\ntem or the map function for a discrete time system) of the underlying system into a power\nseries or a Fourier series of a \fnite number of terms and then to determine the vector of the\nexpansion coe\u000ecients based on data through sparse optimization. The sparse optimization\nprinciple has been demonstrated to be e\u000bective for \fnding the governing equations of cer-\ntain types of nonlinear dynamical systems for inferring the detailed connection structures of\ncomplex dynamical networks such as oscillator networks and social networks hosting evolu-\ntionary game dynamics. In spite of the demonstrated success, limitation and open questions\nremain.\nA key requirement is that the coe\u000ecient vector to be determined must be sparse. If the\nvector \feld or the map function contains a few power series terms, such as the classical\nLorenz [90] or R ossler [91] chaotic oscillator, or contains a few Fourier series terms, such as\nthe standard map [129, 130], then sparse optimization can be quite e\u000bective and computa-\ntionally e\u000ecient for \fnding the system equations [78]. However, if the vector \feld or the\nmap function contains a large number of terms in its power series or Fourier series expan-\nsion so that the coe\u000ecient vector to be determined is dense, then the sparse optimization\nmethodology will fail. One such example is the classical Ikeda map [131, 132] that describes\nthe propagation of a laser pulse in an optical cavity:\nF(x;y) =\u0012\na+b(xcos\u001e\u0000ysin\u001e\nb(xsin\u001e+ycos\u001e\u0013\n; (33)\nwith the nonlinear phase variable \u001egiven by\n\u001e\u0011p\u0000k\n1 +x2+y2; (34)\nwherea,b,k, andpare parameters.

Nu-\nmerous studies elaborating the stability of materials and\nthe mobility of ions have been conducted using theoret-\nical calculations because these aspects are directly re-\nlated to device performance. To further advance our\nunderstanding of the operating mechanisms of such ion-\nconducting devices, atomic-scale analyses of ionic motion\nin device operating circumstances, that is, under electric\nfields, are crucial.\nAssuming a linear response, external forces arising\nfrom applied electric fields can be estimated simply by\nmultiplying the electric field vector by the valence states\nof the ions. In electronic state calculations, such as den-\nsity functional theory (DFT) calculations, the valence\nstates are often evaluated, for instance, using Mulliken\ncharges from the coefficients of atomic orbitals [4] or\nBader charges using charge density distributions [5]. By\ncontrast, the Born effective charges are defined from the\ninduced polarisation in a periodic system by their atomic\ndisplacements (see Fig. 1(a)), or are equivalently de-\nfined from the induced atomic forces with respect to the\napplied electric fields. As our current interest lies in\nanalysing ion motion under applied electric fields, and the\nlatter definition precisely corresponds to the target situ-\nation, Born effective charges, rather than static valence\n∗shimizu@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n†watanabe@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jpstates, are the suitable physical quantities to evaluate the\nexternal forces acting on the ions. In addition, the Born\neffective charges can be quantified as the number of each\natom without the arbitrariness of the decomposition of\nthe total charges. In most cases, these per-atom quanti-\nties are compatible with the computational processes of\ndynamic calculations using the methods include the high-dimensional neural network po-\ntential (NNP) [6], Gaussian approximation potential [7],\nmoment tensor potential [8], and spectral neighbour anal-\nysis potential [9]. Numerous studies have demonstrated\nthat ML potentials optimised using DFT calculation data\ncan predict various physical quantities comparable to\nthose of DFT calculations at low computational costs\n[10–13]. Notably, in their applications to solid electrolyte\nmaterials, the predicted ionic conductivities agree well\nwith both the DFT and experimental RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nFirst, we constructed the NNP using a network archi-\ntecture of 125 input nodes, two hidden layers with 15\nnodes, and one output node, [125-15-15-1], for each el-\nemental species. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs)\nof the total energies and atomic forces were 3.34 (2.91)\nmeV/atom and 86.1 (87.9) meV/ ˚A, respectively, for the\nrandomly chosen 90% (10%) of the training (test) data.4\nFIG. 3.

We present COME-robot, the first closed-\nloop framework utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language founda-\ntion model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning\nin real-world scenarios. We meticulously construct a library\nof action primitives for robot exploration, navigation, and\nmanipulation, serving as callable execution modules for GPT-\n4V in task planning. On top of these modules, GPT-4V serves as\nthe brain that can accomplish multimodal reasoning, generate\naction policy with code, verify the task progress, and provide\nfeedback for replanning. Such design enables COME-robot to\n(i) actively perceive the environments, (ii) perform situated rea-\nsoning, and (iii) recover from failures. Through comprehensiveexperiments on a real robot,\nshowcasing state-of-the-art quantitativemethods may require varying numbers of steps\nfor the same task, especially considering COME-robot’s re-\nplanning mechanism. Additionally, to unveil COME-robot’s\nability to recover from failure, we report the recovery rate\n(RR) of COME-robot by tallying all replanned executions\nand the successful ones within these executions.\nB.

For missed detections, COME-\nrobot directs perception modules to rebuild the local object\nscene graph and re-detect the missing object, achieving a\n100% recover rate as shown in Tab. IV. For wrong detections,\nCOME-robot utilizes GPT-4V to conduct a verification step\nfor detected objects. For example, in case 3 of Fig. 5, when\ntheexplore_local function detects multiple candidate\ncups, COME-robot verifies each cup with image observations\nand finds that cup_0 is actually a doll that is wrongly\ndetected as cup and not related to the task. Though this\nverification process can help mitigate the problem, it is\nstill error-prone to incorrect predictions, leaving 6 falsely\ndetected objects after verification, with three of which lead\nto task failure as shown in Tab. IV. Other errors stem from\nmistakes in visual analysis, which are due to the blurred\nimages or issues inherent to the VLM. For instance, in\ncase 1 of Fig. 5, when GPT-4V attempts to confirm the\nsuccess of the placement, it only sees two cups because\nthe image fails to capture the cups completely, leading to\na misjudgment. However, COME-robot corrects this error\nby conducting another local exploration and discovering that\nthere are actually three cups on the table.\nb) Execution Failures: COME-robot’s GPT-4V-based\nplanning method may sometimes generate incorrect plans\nor invalid API calls, such as attempting to place an object\nwithout prior grasping or calling the navigation function with\nan object name instead of an object. For these errors, COME-\nrobot verifies the generated plan and code, and triggers\nexceptions during execution, providing explicit feedback in-dicating the missing step or wrong function call for GPT-4V\nto rectify the plan. For actual execution, the primary source\nof failed execution is caused by unsuccessful grasps. Grasp-\ning failures are primarily due to the impractical position\nthe robot navigates to that significantly\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The methodology of causal discovery can be characterized into constraint-based, score-based,\nand Functional Causal Model (FCM)-based references (the differences between ground-truth labels and identified causal\ninformation on benchmark datasets) with the differences between ground-truth labels and identified\ncausal information on synthetic datasets; cf. Fig. 1a. Besides causal information on different levels,\nmetrics also indicate model capabilities of capturing joint or individual information, depending on\nthe task. For example, individual causal information can be d-separations and causal directions. Joint\ncausal information is based on the aggregation and integration of individual causal information.\nMetrics on causal skeletons. Causal skeletons can be determined by constraint-based causal\ndiscovery Related Work\nTo understand tabular data models from different perspectives, and to make progress towards better\nreal-world performance, a suite of benchmarks with different purposes is needed.

Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is optimised to minimise a loss ℒℒ\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels. The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains, such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et al., 2024], drug discovery [Chithrananda et al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et al., 2023], and natural language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning, which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et al., 2021, Brown et al., 2020].\n\n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\n\nAmongst the Earth’s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly data-rich [Reichstein et al., 2019, Bauer et al., 2015] and therefore constitutes ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction tasks with abundant training data [Lam et al., 2023, Bi et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2023a, b, Han et al., 2024, Kochkov et al., 2024, Lessig et al., 2023, Pathak et al., 2022, Bonev et al., 2023, Andrychowicz et al., 2023, Ham et al., 2019, Nguyen et al., 2023a, b].

The proposed architecture capitalizes on the\nself-attention mechanism of transformers to capture the intricate\npatterns and dependencies present in the raw bytes of the\nnetwork packet payloads, rather than relying on statistical-based\nfeatures from packets. The payload contains the actual content\nof the network packet and would likely hold discernible patterns\nor signatures of malicious activity, while other information,\nsuch as the packet headers, are only meant for the transmission\nand management of data over a network and primarily contain\naddressing and protocol information.

D ATA\nA. Datasets\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we\nuse several well-known and reputable datasets in this pa-\nper: the UNSW-NB15 [9] and CIC-IoT23 [10]. The UNSW-\nNB15 dataset was created to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe limited amount of publicly available intrusion detection\nnetwork datasets, and includes 100 GB of raw network PCAP\n(Packet Capture) traffic, with various types of real and synthetic\nattacks. The CIC-IoT23 dataset aims to contribute a new and\nrealistic IoT attack dataset, including seven different types of\nattacks categories. The data was recorded over an IoT topology\ncomposed of 105 devices, including raw network PCAP files\nfor each type of attack and benign instances.B. Data Pre-processing\nIn this section, we describe the pre-processing steps to pre-\npare the datasets. The UNSW-NB15 dataset offers an extensive\nset of ground truth labels and various components like the\nnetwork five-tuple and attack timelines. From the available 100\nGB of PCAP data, 4 GB were chosen to ensure efficiency\nthroughout the study. For the CIC-IOT23 dataset, one benign\nand three attack PCAP files were chosen: Benign, Backdoor\nMalware, Vulnerability Attack, and Brute Force Attack.\nFor our study, we are only interested in the TCP and the UDP\ntransport layer information since these account for the majority\nof the network traffic on the transport layer. We discard packets\nthat do not contain any payloads, corresponding to handshakes,\nacknowledgment, and any other network protocols and only\nfocus on the packets that contain payloads.\n1) UNSW-NB15: Each PCAP file is processed by extracting\nthe network five-tuple from each TCP or UDP packet, along\nwith the timestamp and the corresponding transport layer\npayload. The transport layer payload bytes are converted to\nhexadecimal format, with all duplicate payload values omitted.\nThe following step is to cross-reference the resulting dataset\nagainst the ground truth labels. By matching the rows based on\nIP addresses, ports, and adjusting the attack start and end time\nfields, we accurately label the benign and malicious network\ntraffic flows. The network five-tuple is only used to cross-\nreference the ground truth labels, not as input into the model.\nThe payload bytes are converted into hexadecimal and are then\ntransformed into decimal integer format. These decimal integers\nare the primary input into the model architecture.\nThe outputs of the above process finalize the attack portion\nof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The payload column data are\nselected and assigned labels of 1 for each row of malicious\ndata. Similarly, we randomly select an equal number of benign\npayload entries as malicious entries to balance the final dataset.\nThe benign entries are labeled as 0.

F-SSL\nenables the re-purposing of heterogeneous, unlabeled, and\nuncurated real-world image data for various downstream\ntasks. ( viz., image recognition [18], object detection[14],\nsemantic segmentation[33], facial recognition, authentica-\ntion [15, 38], etc.) by collaboratively learning intermediate\nvisual representations in a privacy-preserving fashion.\nOne of the unique challenges of F-SSL is learning visual\nrepresentations from non-independently and identically dis-\ntributed ( Non-iid ) data [50, 26, 36]. Recent studies in\nF-SSL, both image-based [50] and video-based [36], di-\nrectly extend the state-of-the-art (SOTA) centralized SSL\npre-training techniques (e.g., SimCLR [5], SimSiam [6],\nBYOL [12], Barlow Twins [45] Speed [1], VCOP [43], and\nCtP [40]) under the setting of FL. Generally, these F-SSL results on the \u000b= 0:2setting are better\nthan others.

Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive models into visual generation (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Esser et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024). These approaches first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization, then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g., VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality. Although some improvements are done (Yu et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization, and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013; Rombach et al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2 (Yu et al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2. To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128×\\times×128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark (Deng et al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation: Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design (i.e., mask generative methods (Chang et al., 2022) for visual synthesis), we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce “next sub-token prediction” to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2.

They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Introduction\n\nThanks to recent advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\nWhile such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance, editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling, texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Kamata et al., 2023; Haque et al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to enhance creators’ content development process.\nFollowing the recent development of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque et al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model ”Instruct-Pix2Pix” (Brooks et al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments, their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results. As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\nA summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe propose a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n•\n\nOur experimental results illustrate the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2. Related Work\n\n\n2.1. Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et al., 2020), became one of the most popular implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such as polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the ”nerfacto” model implemented by Nerfstudio (Tancik et al., 2023), which is a combination of modular features from multiple papers (Wang et al., 2021; Barron et al., 2022; Müller et al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et al., 2021; Verbin et al., 2022)\n, designed to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.

(2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)—an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models’ accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU’s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n•\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary’s ability to determine optimal updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n•\n\nTo overcome RMU’s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU—a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples. However, this method becomes more computationally expensive as the size of datasets and modern deep networks grows. Existing works focus on approximating unlearning (Warnecke et al. 2021; Izzo et al. 2021; Sekhari et al. 2021; Isonuma and Titov 2024) using Influence Function (Koh and Liang 2017; Grosse et al. 2023), gradient projection (Bae et al. 2023), gradient ascent (Thudi et al. 2022; Trippa et al. 2024), second-order approximation (Jia et al. 2024), preference optimization (Zhang et al. 2024b), and embedding corrupted (Liu et al. 2024a). Other views on the landscape of machine unlearning include: unlearning in text classification (Ma et al. 2022), image classification and recognition (Ginart et al. 2019; Golatkar, Achille, and Soatto 2020; Fan et al. 2024; Choi and Na 2023; Cha et al. 2024), image-to-image generative models (Li et al. 2024a), diffusion models (Gandikota et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2024a; Kumari et al. 2023), multimodal unlearning (Cheng and Amiri 2023), federated unlearning (Liu et al. 2020a; Romandini et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2022; Che et al. 2023; Halimi et al. 2022; Jeong, Ma, and Houmansadr 2024), graph unlearning (Chen et al. 2022; Chien,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Particularly at\nremote sites, such as offshore oil and gas fields (Hussain,\nMokhtari, Ghalambor and Salehi (2022)), space stations\n(Aume, Andrews, Pal, James, Seth and Mukhopadhyay\n(2022)), submarines and underwater robots (ROVs) (Ka-\nbanov and Kramar (2022)), the Industry 4.0 paradigm shift\ndemands systems to serverlessly process emerging data-\ndriven and latency-sensitive applications under harsh oper-\national environment where there is limited/no access to the\ncloudservices,andhumanresourcesarescarceandnotcom-\nputer literate.

It has imposed significant and unprecedented  sufferings and threats for \npremature death  [2]. Unequivocally , it is now regarded as  the most deadly and dangerous disease that ma kes \nsevere panic to the crowd [3].  The well-known reason for death  of this pandemic  is obstacles in oxygen intake \ndue to inflammation lung, filled air sacs with discharge and fluid  [3]. Early  identification of the  COVID can  not \nonly reduce  death  rate sharply, but also most prone  to faster recovery  phase  [1]. \nFor the first time in the December of 2019, the sick persons  infected with COVID -19 were identified in Wuhan, \nChina  [4]. Often, the patients develop a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, weariness , sore throat, pains, runny \nnose, body aches, and diarrhoea symptoms.  High fever and dry cough are its core symptoms  [3]. Its symptoms \nare similar to pneumonia and influenza- A that affect the human respiratory tract and lungs  [1, 5] . Since the \nseparation of infection between COVID -19 and bacterial pneumonia is not an easy task, the automatic feature \nextraction from images can help to diagnose the disease [6]. The di fference is that lung lesions in COVID -19 \npatients are higher than pneumonia and influenza diseases [7]. In fact, COVID- 19 damages the lungs intensely.  \nThe virus causes the demise of most persons  who have chronic diseases  (for instance, diabetes) [8].   \nThe viability of this virus in the air is  expected to be for almost three hours  [3]. It can travel through the \npatient's cough or sneeze droplets fro m person to person in close contact. It can even contaminate humans with \neating food in infected copper, plastic, and stainless steel dishes . It should be mentioned out  the COVID‐ 19 can \nbe live in aforementioned utensils  for several hours  [3]. \nSeveral diagnostic tasks  such as  viral throat swab testing , blood, and serologic tests are conducted for this \ndisease . Also, Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR) is a yardstick from Nasopharyngeal \nSwabs (NS) and Or -pharyngeal Swabs (OS) samples. Nevertheless, these recognition measures do  not only require \nmanual intervention but also are time -consuming process es [2, 9] . Therefore, using  the X-ray or Computed \nTomography (CT) data  is more preferable [10, 11] . These scanning images conspicuously indicate COVID -19 \nviral infections  with higher confidence .

While the capabilities of learned robot policies have increased dramatically, achieving human-level performance in terms of accuracy, speed and generality still remains a grand challenge in many domains. One such domain is table tennis – a physically demanding sport which requires human players to undergo years of training to achieve an advanced level of proficiency. Indeed, competitive matches are often breathtakingly dynamic, involving complex motion, rapid eye-hand coordination, and high-level strategies that adapt to the opponent’s strengths and weaknesses. For a robotic table tennis system to mimic these abilities it needs high-speed motion, precise control, real-time decision-making and human-robot interaction. Thanks to these demanding requirements, table tennis provides a rich environment to advance robotic capabilities and has served as a benchmark for robotics research since the 1980s [4]. Numerous table tennis robots have been developed since and progress has been made on returning the ball to the opponent’s side [5], hitting to a target position [6], smashing [7], cooperative rallying [8], and many other critical aspects of table tennis [9]. Yet no prior work has tackled the competitive game in which a robot plays a full game of table tennis against a previously unseen human opponent.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first learned robot agent that can play competitive table tennis at human level, as depicted in Figure 1. The robot uses a combination of techniques (known and novel) in order to acquire skills at different levels of abstraction. Table tennis players must be prepared to return balls across a wide variety of positions, speeds, and spins (i.e. angular velocities) and competitive players must know how to manipulate these factors to set up advantageous plays or exploit opponent weaknesses. Thus, there are two levels of play: the high level strategic decisions and the low level physical skills required to execute those strategies. This organization adds an additional layer of challenge to robotic sports where, unlike a purely strategic game like chess or go, the policy not only needs to decide the most advantageous move, but also needs to have the physical skills to perform it and may even have to choose a less strategically optimal action if it is not confident in successful execution. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and modular policy architecture. Our system consists of multiple low-level skill policies and a high-level controller that selects between them. Each low-level skill policy specializes in a specific aspect of table tennis, such as forehand topspin, backhand targeting, or forehand serve. Training is efficient — each skill builds on top of the same foundation policy for a given category (e.g. forehand, backhand), and once a good skill has been trained it can always be subsequently specialized. In addition to learning the policy itself, we collect and store information both offline and online about the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of each low-level skill. The resulting skill descriptors provide the robot with important information regarding its abilities and shortcomings. In turn, a high-level controller, responsible for\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Ac-\ncording to the E\u000ecient-Market hypothesis (Kirkpatrick & Dahlquist, 2008),\nstock market prices follow a random walk process with unpredictable future\n\ructuations. When it comes to Bitcoin, its price \ructuates highly, which makes\nits forecasting challenging (Phaladisailoed & Numnonda, 2018). Technical and\nfundamental analysis are two typical tools used by traders to build their trading\nstrategies in the \fnancial markets. According to price movement and trading\nvolume, technical analysis provides trading signals (Murphy, 1999). Fundamen-\ntal analysis, unlike the former, examines related economic and \fnancial factors\nto determine a security's underlying worth (Drakopoulou, 2016).\nHumans and computers both perform data analysis. Although humans are\nable to keep an eye on \fnancial charts (such as prices) and make decisions based\non their past experiences, managing a vast volume of data is complicated due to\nvarious factors in\ruencing the price movement. As a result, algorithmic trading\nhas emerged to tackle this issue. Algorithmic trading is a type of trading where\na computer that has been pre-programmed with a speci\fc set of mathematical\nrules is employed (Th\u0013 eate & Ernst, 2021). There are two sorts of approaches\nin \fnancial markets: price prediction and algorithmic trading. Price prediction\naims to build a model that can precisely predict future prices, whereas algorith-\nmic trading is not limited to the price prediction and attempts to participate\nin the \fnancial market (e.g. choosing a position and the number of trading\nshares) to maximize pro\ft (Hirchoua et al., 2021). It is claimed that a more\nprecise prediction does not necessarily result in a higher pro\ft. In other words,\na trader's overall loss due to incorrect actions may be greater than the gain due\nto correct ones (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, algorithmic trading has been the\nfocus of this study.\nClassical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), which are power-\nful tools for recognizing patterns, have been employed in various research \felds.\nIn recent years, using the ML as an intelligent agent has risen in popularity over\n2the alternative of the traditional approaches in which a human being makes a\ndecision. For two reasons, the ML and DL have enhanced theperformance in\nalgorithmic trading. Firstly, they can extract complex patterns from data that\nare di\u000ecult for humans to accomplish. Secondly, emotion does not a\u000bect their\nperformance, which is a disadvantage for humans (Chakole et al., 2021). How-\never, there are two compelling reasons why the ML and DL in a supervised\nlearning approach are unsuitable for algorithmic trading. Firstly, supervised\nlearning is improper for learning problems with long-term and delayed rewards\n(Dang, 2019), such as trading in \fnancial markets, which is why Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), a sub\feld of ML, is required to solve a decision-making prob-\nlem (trading) in an uncertain environment (\fnancial market) using the Markov\nDecision Process (MDP). Secondly, in supervised learning, labeling is a critical\nissue a\u000becting the performance of the \fnal model. To illustrate, classi\fcation\nand regression approaches with de\fned labels may not be appropriate, leading\nto the selection of RL, which does not require labels and instead uses a goal\n(reward function) to determine its policy.\nRecent studies have usually employed discrete action space RL to address\nalgorithmic trading problems (Chakole et al., 2021; Jeong & Kim, 2019; Shi\net al., 2021; Th\u0013 eate & Ernst, 2021), which compels\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDeep probabilistic State Space Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations [22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs [16, 48, 15] offer a powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art transformers while improving computational complexity [15].\nThese models assume states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial [10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast, due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability, the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba, uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing [28, 40, 27] to infer belief states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model based on Mamba [15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system states.\nFigure 1 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs [44].\nSimilarly, we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations [42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch [39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL [41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions, KalMamba enables end-to-end model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference and tight variational lower bound [5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful, allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations are unavailable.\n\n\nWe evaluate KalMamba on several tasks from the DeepMind Control (DMC) Suite [50], training an off-the-shelf Soft Actor-Critic [21] on beliefs inferred from both images\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1.

Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12, 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability. To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations. BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution, but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise, short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\nSCUNet [74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g., VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details. They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR. Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear), but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\nAccording to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

A reason for this could be\nthat texts containing negation are underrepresented\nin training data of language models, as humans tend\nto express themselves using affirmative rather than\nnegative expressions (Ettinger, 2020). Regardless,\nnegation has been shown to be challenging even for\nhumans to correctly interpret due to the diversity of\nforms across domains (Truong et al., 2022a). For\ninstance, in clinical documents, many acronyms\nare used to denote negation such as NAD (no ab-\nnormality detected) , and implicit negation abounds,\nsuch as normal chest x-ray scan , which implies the\nabsence of an abnormality. Even more complex is\nthe use of negation in combination with other lin-\nguistic phenomena such as quantifiers, gradable ad-\njectives ( not unattractive does not imply attractive )\n∗Now at Google DeepMind.(Truong et al., 2022b); licensing context (negative\npolarity items, e.g. any, either, yet , normally appear\nin certain negative grammatical contexts Warstadt\net al. (2019)); downward entailment ( A man owns a\ndogentails A man owns an animal butA man does\nnot own a dog does not entail A man does not own\nan animal ) (Geiger et al., 2020).\nTraditionally, negation has been treated as a stan-\ndalone problem, e.g. as negation detection (Chap-\nman et al., 2001). The investigation of the im-\npact of negation in various downstream tasks (Hos-\nsain et al., 2022; Hossain and Blanco, 2022a), or\nthrough probing (Ettinger, 2020) has revealed sev-\neral limitations of modern large language models\n(“LLMs”) in handling negation. Given that LLMs\nare being adopted in an ever-growing range of tasks\nand have been shown to display emergent abilities\nfor high-level tasks that require complex reasoning\n(Wei et al., 2022a), we are interested in exploring\nhow the handling of negation has progressed.\nIn this work, we investigate the performance\nof auto-regressive language models on different\nnegation-focused benchmarks. Instead of just look-\ning at samples containing negation in common\nNLP datasets, we consider datasets in which nega-\ntion plays an important role in making the correct\njudgement.

This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample, recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1). Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin, Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n© S. Hanneke, S. Moran & T.

Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran, Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\nMoran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity is independent\nof the label space’s size.\nA natural question that has not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\nprinciples in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization, and Occam’s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work, we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain of list learning.\n1.1.

Given\nthe complexity of AI systems, it is often suggested that decision-makers could benefit from access\nto explanations of their predictions. The hope is that such explanations will help decision-makers\nreason about when and when not to rely on the AI system’s predictions, achieving appropriate\nreliance [4]. However, across many domains, empirical studies of explanations have produced mixed RELATED WORK AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nFirst, we overview related work on explainable AI (XAI), focusing on XAI for ML models—what is\nsometimes referred to as interpretability in the ML literature [ 27,57]. We then overview why XAI is\nbelieved to be useful for human-AI decision-making and gaps in the community’s understanding.\n2.1 Overview of XAI\nGiven the increasing use of AI and ML systems, there is a growing need for people interacting with\nthese systems to understand the underlying models. The technical field of explainable AI (XAI)\ngrew out of these concerns. A diverse set of XAI conclusions about their precise relations and impact on decisions.\nWe also acknowledge the trade-off of a two-phase study design that showed participants the\nsame set of instances in both phases. While this design allowed us to analyze cases where the\nhuman-alone decisions agree or disagree with the AI predictions separately, this design may have\nstrengthened, in some cases, participants’ prior intuition more than a realistic human-AI decision-\nmaking setting. That being said, we do not foresee any type of intuition to be contingent on the\nset-up of our study design.\nOur study was also limited by the choice of decision tasks and explanation METHODS\nWe describe the set-up of our study and analysis, the two prediction tasks that we asked participants\nto engage with, and the types of explanations they were shown. We then overview our experimental\ndesign and study procedure and discuss the approaches used to analyze the data collected during\nour study. We note that participation was voluntary and the study was IRB approved.\n3.1 Participants\nSince our research questions do not target any specific population, we chose to start with a\nconvenience sampling strategy and then diversify our selection from a large pool of sign-ups based\non their background shapes perceptions of AI explanations. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.13509 (2021).\n[29] Upol Ehsan and Mark O Riedl. 2020.

The core of recommender system is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate, purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n(CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\nprediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6,19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\nin predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS) [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure of a user — more specifically, her one-hop neighbors — to\nimprove the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\nneighbors, Wang et al. [ 39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network (GCN) [ 14,23], following the samearXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020propagation rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation, and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results of the 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n•The best setting in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n•The second best setting is using L1normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e., LightGCN- L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n•Normalizing symmetrically on two sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness. As we have analyzed\nin Section 3.2.3, a 2-layer LightGCN smooths a user’s embedding\nbased on the users that have overlap on her interacted items, and\nthe smoothing strength between two users cv→uis measured in\nEquation (14). We speculate that such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN’s effectiveness. To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU=MX\nu=1MX\nv=1cv→u(eu\n||eu||2−ev\n||ev||2)2, (17)\nwhere the L2norm on embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding’s scale. Similarly we can obtained the\ndefinition for item embeddings. Table 6 shows the smoothness\nof two models, matrix factorization (i.e., using the E(0)for model\nprediction) and the 2-layer LightGCN-single (i.e., using the E(2)for\nprediction). Note that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is much lower\nthan that of MF. This indicates that by conducting light graph\nconvolution, the embeddings become smoother and more suitable\nfor recommendation.01e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2\nRegularization0.0200.0250.0300.0350.0400.0450.0500.0550.060recall@20\n01e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2\nRegularization0.0100.0150.0200.0250.0300.0350.0400.0450.050ndcg@20\nFigure 5: Performance of 2-layer LightGCN w.r.t. different\nregularization coefficient λon Yelp and Amazon-Book.\n4.5 Hyper-parameter Studies\nWhen applying LightGCN to a new dataset, besides the standard\nhyper-parameter learning rate,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

The first neural network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great success. However, with the development of network technology, the information carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example, the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080 image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels, each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning. In terms of depth improvement, there are neural networks represented by ResNet, Inception, and DenseNet; in terms of channel information utilization improvement, there are neural networks represented by SENet and ShuffleNet; in terms of attention improvement, there are neural networks\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Traditionally, the centralized training process raises\n.significant data privacy and security concerns due to the neces-\nsity of transferring local information. Federated learning (FL), as\nintroduced by [ 31], offers a solution to these privacy challenges\nby enabling collaborative model training across numerous clients\nunder the orchestration of a central server, without sharing the\nraw data. FL systems bring obvious advantages by involving clients\ndownloading a global model, performing local updates using their\ndata, and then sending these updates back to the server. The server\naggregates these updates to enhance the global model, thereby\npreserving data privacy. Aside from the privacy considerations\nmentioned above, there are two fundamental acknowledgements\nabout (cross-device) federated learning which have been widely\nrecognized: data heterogeneity among clients and the limited and\ndiverse computational resources on local devices [18, 30, 31, 52].\nData heterogeneity represents a significant challenge in feder-\nated learning. It largely stems from the fact that the data across\nparticipating clients are distributed independently, with each client\nhaving a different sample distribution. Due to the diversity in clients’\ndatasets. these datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, lead-\ning to client models that are biased toward the more common classes\n[36,43]. This discrepancy often results, particularly for classes with few\ndata. Compared to classes with abundant data, those with fewer\ninstances often experience misclassification, with minority class\ndata being inaccurately labeled as belonging to majority classes.\nThis starkly underscores the significance of our global alignment\nstrategy in enhancing both the performance and fairness of the FL\nsystem.\n4.3.3 methods like CReFF [ 38] and CLIP2FL [ 39]. This aspect\nis vital because the transmission of gradients could enable theJianyi Zhang, Hao Frank Yang, Ang Li, Xin GUO, Pu Wang, Haiming Wang, Yiran Chen, and Hai Li\nTable 4: Comparison between pretrained and non-pretrained models under constrained training dataset settings.

By eliminating this step,\nour method diminishes the likelihood of leaking sensitive client\ninformation, promoting a more secure and privacy-centric learning\nenvironment.\nComputational Efficiency. : Our approach also stands out for\nits computational economy. Contrary to approaches like CLIP2FL,\nwhich necessitate deploying sizable multimodal models such as\nCLIP on client devices—demanding significant memory and poten-\ntially being unfeasible for edge devices with limited resources—our\nmethod positions the MLLM solely on the server side. At the client\nlevel, we deploy only the compact FL models. This resolution not\nonly addresses memory constraints but also reduces the time and\nenergy expenditure associated with federated local training. Conse-\nquently, our framework is rendered more practical and appealing\nfor an extensive array of devices, particularly those with restricted\nstorage capacities.\nCompatibility. : Our approach stands out for its adaptability, un-\nlike specific methodologies like CReFF and CLIP2FL that impose\nunique requirements on federated local training and global aggre-\ngation.

The main difference is that FedNS sketches local Hessian St\njH1/2\nDj,ton the loss function while FedNS\ndirectly sketches the global Hessian StH1/2\nD,ton the objective.\nIn Algorithm 1, we generalize local sketch matrices (St\nj)m\nj=1of the dimension k×njin an independent serialization. By\nconcatenating local sketch matrices in the column direction and local square-root Hessian matrices in the row direction, we\nobtain\nSt= [St\n1,···,St\nm],\nH1/2\nD,t= [HD1,t,···,HDm,t]⊤.\nThe above equations lead to\nStH1/2\nD,t=X\nj=1St\njH1/2\nDj,t.\nTherefore, the update of FedNS recovers the centralized Newton’s method.\nFrom Corollary 1 (Pilanci and Wainwright 2017), the sketch size is lower bounded by the form of the squared Gaussian width,\nwhich is at most min{N, M}. Since N > M in federated learning, we have k≳M. The distance ∥wt−wD,λ∥becomes\nsubstantially less than 1as the iteration increase. And then from Corollary 1 in (Pilanci and Wainwright 2017), considering\nthe Newton sketch iterates using the iteration-dependent sketching accuracy ϵ=1\nlog(1+ t), it holds with the probability at least\n1−c1e−c2kϵ2that\n∥wt−wD,λ∥2\n≤1\nlog(1 + t)β\nγ∥wt−1−wD,λ∥2+4L\nγ∥wt−wD,λ∥2\n2.\nNote that from Lemma 1 in (Pilanci and Wainwright 2017), the sketch size satisfies m≳ϵ−2M=1\nlog2(1+t)M.\nConvergence Analysis for FedNDES\nProof of Theorem 2. From Theorem 2 (Pilanci and Wainwright 2017) and Lemma (Lacotte, Wang, and Pilanci 2021), based on\nthe backtracking parameters (a, b)in Algorithm 2, we define the parameters\nν:=abη2\n1 +\u0010\n1+ϵ\n1−ϵ\u0011\nη, η :=1\n81−1\n2\u0010\n1+ϵ\n1−ϵ\u00112\n−a\n\u0010\n1+ϵ\n1−ϵ\u00113.\nThen, from Theorem 2 (Lacotte, Wang, and Pilanci 2021), to obtain δ-accurate solution with the probability at least 1−p0, the\nnumber of total iterations Tshould satisfy the condition\nT≤T:=L(w0)−L(wD,λ)\nν+Tτ,3\n8δ+ 1,\nwhere limτ→0Tτ,3\n8δ≤log(8/3δ)\nlog(25 /16).\nMeanwhile, two stages sketch sizes should satisfy\nm1≳˜dλ+ log\u0012T\np0\u0013\nlog ˜dλT\np0!\n,\nm2≳δ−τ\"\n˜dλ+ log\u0012T\np0δτ/2\u0013\nlog ˜dλT\np0!#\n.\nWe consider the linear convergence case,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are being bombarded with a vast amount of information due to the growing popularity of the Internet and the development of User Generated Content (UGC) (Krumm et al., 2008) in recent years.\nTo save users from information overload, recommender systems have been widely applied in today’s short video (Liu et al., 2019), news (Wang et al., 2018b) and e-commerce (Chen et al., 2019b) platforms.\nWhile complicated models (Pi et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023c) often offer higher accuracy, their poor efficiency makes online deployment challenging because of latency restrictions (Pi et al., 2019). On the other hand, simple models (Huang et al., 2013; Rendle, 2010) have capacity limitations, but they could evaluate a great number of items efficiently because of their low time complexity. Therefore, striking a balance between efficacy and efficiency becomes crucial in order to quickly filter out information that users are interested in. As is shown in Figure 1 (a), one widely used solution in the industry is multi-stage cascade ranking systems (Wang et al., 2011).\nThe system includes a retriever and a variety of subsequent rankers.\nIn the very first stage of the cascade system, referred to as the retrieval stage in this paper (also called matching stage or recall stage in some literature (Qin et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022)), a retriever is typically used to quickly eliminate irrelevant items from a large pool of candidates, whereas rankers in the later stages aim to accurately rank the items. Each stage selects the top-K𝐾Kitalic_K items it receives and feeds them to the next stage.\nAs shown in Figure 1 (a), rankers in multi-stage cascade ranking systems are arranged in the shape of a funnel, narrowing from bottom to top. The retrieval and ranking stage are two typical stages, while pre-ranking (Wang et al., 2020d) and re-ranking (Xi et al., 2023a) stages are relatively optional, and the number of rankers in the system may vary depending on different scenarios. Additionally, on the left side of Figure 1 (a), we display the approximate output scale of each stage, noting that the range of this scale is specific to the particular platform and scenario.\n\n\nFigure 1. The multi-stage architecture in modern recommender systems and the illustration of multi-channel retrieval. The latter will be detailed further in Section  2.4.\n\n\nAlthough both the retrieval and ranking stages aim to select the most relevant items, each stage has its own unique characteristics.\n\n\n•\n\nDifference in candidate sets (i.e., inference spaces).\nThe retrieval stage needs to quickly filter through the entire item pool, which may contain millions of items; while the ranking stage only needs to score and order the items that have been selected by the retrieval methods, typically narrowing down to hundreds or thousands of items.\n\n\n\n•\n\nDifference in input features.\nDuring the retrieval stage, due to time constraints and the need to filter through a large candidate set quickly, utilizing complex feature interactions is impractical for real-time online requirements. As a result, only limited, coarse-grained features of users and items are considered.\nIn contrast, the ranking stage can utilize a diverse set of features by designing various feature interaction operators, such as product operators (Qu et al., 2016), convolutional operators (Li et al., 2019a), and attention operators (Xiao et al., 2017). The ranking stage further enhances its capability\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

See full examples at[1, 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the security [27, 33] and privacy risks [28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of “jailbreaks”. Most LLMs are safety-aligned [15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general. Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based jailbreaks [33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent the model’s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs [27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the “Do Anything Now” (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content. In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM’s tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered. Figure 1 presents an illustration of real examples of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront would result in the LLM’s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo leads the LLM to perform the task. The complete conversations are available at [1, 2].\n\n\nTo validate and assess Crescendo’s effectiveness, we evaluate it against current state-of-the-art LLMs, ranging from open-source models like LLaMA-2 70b and LLaMA-3 70b to closed-source ones such as Gemini-Pro, Claude-2, Claude-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we start by manually executing Crescendo on a subset of the tasks listed in Table 1 against all models. Our findings confirm that Crescendo can indeed overcome the safety alignment of all models for nearly all tasks (Table 2).\nMoreover, we show that once a multimodal model, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is jailbroken using Crescendo, it can be used for different modality tasks, such as generating images that\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases: (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker’s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect. It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA), all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\ndataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\nFig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\nto analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n• Unlike most prior studies that have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n• Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand the impact of ageing across the gender.\n• As opposed to the previous studies that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\nThe ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4. Methodology\nWe use the linear mixed effect (LME) [24] models to analyze\nthe variation in the ASV score with respect to the age differ-\nence under different gender, language, and session conditions.\nWe fit the following model to ASV score data under different\nconditions:\nSi=µ+β∗δi+γ (1)\nwhere Siis ASV score of i-th trial, µis intercept or mean of the\nASV scores in a particular condition, δiis the age difference\nbetween enrollment and verification audio, βis fixed effect co-\nefficient that establishes a linear relationship between age dif-\nference ( δi) and ASV score Si, andγis a random effect which is\ninduced by other variabilities such as Results and Discussions\n5.1.

Xiang Wang is also affiliated with\nInstitute of Dataspace, Hefei Comprehensive National Science\nCenter.(DDIs) are critical in pharmacology and drug de-\nvelopment (Lin et al., 2020), while solute-solvent\ninteractions (SSIs) are fundamental in solution\nchemistry and the design of chemical processes\n(Varghese and Mushrif, 2019; Chung et al., 2022).\nHowever, the exhaustive experimental validation of\nthese interactions is notoriously time-consuming\nand costly. In response, adopting large language\nmodels (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Taylor et al.,\n2022), known for their vast knowledge repositories\nand advanced logical inference capabilities, has\nemerged as an efficient and effective alternative for\nMRL (Park et al., 2022; Jha et al., 2022a).\nDespite their promise, a primary concern of cur-\nrent LLM-based paradigm is the insufficient data\nexploitation . Specifically, they predominantly rely\non the textual data such as SMILES (Simplified\nMolecular Input Line Entry System) and property\ndescriptions, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of\nstructural information inherent in molecular graphs\n(Sagawa and Kojima, 2023), as indicated in Figure\n1 (a). Current studies have indicated that it is chal-\nlenging for LLMs to fully understand the complex\ngraphs based solely on textual data, hence, it’s cru-\ncial to explicitly model these structures given their\nsignificance in MRL (Park et al., 2022).\nCompounding this concern is the absence of a\nunified framework for LLM-based MRL (Livne\net al., 2023; Pei et al., 2023). Concretely, this ab-\nsence impedes the sharing and integration of inter-\naction mechanisms learned across various datasets,\nleading to a fragmentation in collective insights. Es-\npecially, it poses a catastrophic challenge for tasks\nwith a limited number of labeled pairs (Chung et al.,\n2022), where LLMs often struggle with due to the\nhigh risk of overfitting, as illustrated in Figure 1\n(b). Worse still, such limited datasets are prevalent\nin MRL since the experimental acquisition is often\nconstrained by high costs (Lee et al., 2023a).\nTo overcome these limitations, in this work,\nwe propose MolTC , a unified multi-modal frame-arXiv:2402.03781v6  [q-bio.QM]  10 Jun 2024The first molecule is <n-octane> ,\nitsSMILES is <SMILES1> ,\nwhile the second molecule is \n<Methylpyridine> , its SMILES \nis <SM ILES2> .

To support the application of machine\nlearning algorithms to solve this problem, and to\nencourage researchers in this ﬁeld to attend to prob-\nlems in the ACO setting, we introduce CybORG, a\nwork-in-progress gym for ACO research. CybORG\nfeatures a simulation and emulation environment\nwith a common interface to facilitate the rapid\ntraining of autonomous agents that can then be\ntested on real-world systems. Initial testing demon-\nstrates the feasibility of this approach.\n1Background\nAutonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) is concerned with\nthe defence of computer systems and networks through au-\ntonomous decision-making and action. It is particularly\nneeded where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\nversary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\nrobotics, ACO is affected by the ‘reality gap’ [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021 ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could be critical to an agent’s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\nwhich is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment, precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the ‘reality gap’, used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\nin a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated systems. Successful agents are trans-\nferred to the real system to ﬁrstly validate their effectiveness,\nand secondly to reﬁne the simulation.\nWe believe that AI Gyms, that can be validated and re-\nﬁned throughexperiments, the requirements of ACO motivate an in-\ntegrated design comprising emulation and simulation modes\nto support large scale RL across diverse scenarios.\nWe have made progress towards implementing this design,\nwith the ability to spawn and play games either in simula-\ntion mode or emulation mode with cloud infrastructure. In\nCybORG, we can now train an RL agent in simulation then\ntest its effectiveness in emulation.

Introduction\n\nResearch on large language models (OpenAI, 2023) (LLMs) is expanding in scope and yielding significant scientific advancements rapidly. These language models are pre-trained on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the text (Devlin et al., 2019a; Liu et al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train GPT variants (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly called prompts (Arora et al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as ‘fine-tuning’) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022; Ni et al., 2021; Pradeep et al., 2023a). In addition to leveraging ICL for a purely generative task, e.g., question answering or abstractive summarisation (Brown et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023), a more common use is in a predictive task, such as text classification (Lu et al., 2022; Milios et al., 2023), where each class is specified by a set of words (commonly called a verbaliser (Schick and Schütze, 2021)), e.g., for a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could be defined by the set {{\\{{‘good’, ‘great’, ‘wonderful’…}}\\}}.\nOnce each class for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated text can be mapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over the vocabulary generated by the decoder.\n\n\nIt is to be realised that ICL is somewhat conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k𝑘kitalic_k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples) - the only difference of ICL with k𝑘kitalic_k-NN is that the former involves a frozen set of encoder-decoder parameters of an underlying LLM, where ICL generally works well on any domain with only a small number of examples because, unlike\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozière et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model’s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model’s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\nModels Drop rate AlpacaEval GSM8K MBPP Average\nLM +\nMath0.1 0.805 0.599 / 0.702\n0.3 0.812 0.629 / 0.721\n0.5 0.804 0.645 / 0.724\n0.7 0.787 0.611 / 0.699\n0.9 0.683 0.455 / 0.570\nLM +\nCode0.1 0.741 / 0 0.370\n0.3 0.770 / 0 0.385\n0.5 0.802 / 0.152 0.477\n0.7 0.798 / 0.34 0.569\n0.9 0.737 / 0.262 0.500\nMath +\nCode0.1 / 0.619 0.166 0.393\n0.3 / 0.618 0.184 0.401\n0.5 / 0.626 0.206 0.416\n0.7 / 0.633 0.19 0.412\n0.9 / 0.622 0.128 0.375\nLM +\nMath +\nCode0.1 0.732 0.545 0.114 0.464\n0.3 0.766 0.623 0.302 0.564\n0.5 0.794 0.630 0.3 0.575\n0.7 0.770 0.622 0.23 0.541\n0.9 0.688 0.446 0.128 0.421\nTable 7: Drop Rate of parameters against Task perfor-\nmance Appendix\nA.1 Importance of GPT4-as-a-judge for Math\ntasks - Example\nQuestion: Each person in a certain\nhousehold consumes 0.2 kg of rice ev-\nery meal.

The crystal blue waters, the lively atmosphere, and the stunning cityscape in the results demonstrated by LLaV A-1.5,\nseveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, LLaV A-\n1.5 utilizes full image patches, potentially prolonging each\ntraining iteration. While visual resamplers [ 3,14,32] re-\nduce the number of visual patches in LLMs, they currently\ncannot achieve convergence as efficiently as LLaV A with a\ncomparable amount of training data, probably due to more\ntrainable parameters in the resamplers. The developmentof a sample-efficient visual resampler could pave the way\nfor future scaling-up of instruction-following multimodal\nmodels. Second, LLaV A-1.5 is not yet capable of processing\nmultiple images due to the lack of such instruction-following\ndata, and the limit of the context length. Third, although\nLLaV A-1.5 exhibits proficiency in following complex in-\nstructions, its problem-solving capabilities can still be lim-\nited in certain domains, which could be improved with a\nmore capable language model and with high-quality, tar-\ngeted visual instruction tuning data. Finally, despite its sig-\nnificantly reduced propensity for hallucination, LLaV A-1.5\nis not exempt from producing hallucinations and occasion-\nally disseminating misinformation, and should be used with\ncaution in critical applications ( e.g. medical). Related Work\nInstruction-following large multimodal models (LMMs).\nCommon architectures include a pre-trained visual backbone\nto encode visual features, a pre-trained large language model\n(LLM) to comprehend the user instructions and produce\nresponses, and a vision-language cross-modal connector\nto align the vision encoder outputs to the language mod-\nels. As shown in Fig. 1, LLaV A [ 36] is perhaps the sim-\nplest architecture for LMMs. Optionally, visual resamplers\n(e.g. Qformer [ 32]) are used to reduce the number of vi-\nsual patches [ 3,14,62]. Training an instruction-following\nLMM usually follows a two-stage protocol. First, the vision-\nlanguage alignment pretraining stage leverages image-text\npairs to align the visual features with the language model’s\nword embedding space. Earlier works utilize relatively few\nimage-text pairs ( e.g.∼600K [ 36] or∼6M [ 62]), while some\nrecent works pretrain the vision-language connector for a spe-\ncific language model on a large amount of image-text pairs\n(e.g. 129M [ 14] and 1.4B [ 3]), to maximize the LMM’s per-\nformance. Second, the visual instruction tuning stage tunes\nthe model on visual instructions [ 36], to enable the model to\nfollow users’ diverse requests on instructions that involve the\nvisual contents. Dealing with higher resolution with grids in\nLMM are studied in con-current works [1, 28, 53].\nMultimodal instruction-following data. In NLP, studies\nshow that the quality of instruction-following data largely\naffects the capability of the resulting instruction-following\nmodels [ 61]. For visual instruction tuning, LLaV A [ 36] is the\npioneer to leverage text-only GPT-4 to expand the existing\nCOCO [ 35] bounding box and caption dataset to a multi-\nmodal instruction-following dataset that contains three types\nof instruction-following data: conversational-style QA, de-\ntailed description, and complex reasoning. LLaV A’s pipeline\nhas been employed to expand to textual understanding [ 57],\nmillion-scales [ 58], and region-level conversations [ 8]. In-\nstructBLIP [ 14] incorporates academic-task-oriented VQA\ndatasets to further enhance the model’s visual capabilities.\nConversely, [ 7] identifies that such naive data merging can\nresult in models that tend to overfit to VQA datasets and\nthus are unable to participate in natural conversations.

L ESSONS LEARNED , OPEN CHALLENGES ,AND\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nAs OTA-FL in wireless environments continues to gain\nattention, researchers are actively working to tackle the asso-\nciated challenges and improve system performance. However,\nthere are still several open questions and directions for further\nresearch in this area. Some of these challenging questions are\ndiscussed in the following.\nA. Aggregation Distortion\nOTA-FL systems face the challenge of distortion introduced\nby channel fading, noise, and transceiver ﬁltering, which can\ndegrade the quality of the received summation signal [87],\n[88]. Minimizing this distortion has been a persistent challenge\nin OTA-FL. Coded OTA can help reduce distortion but adds\ncomplexity to the system with coding and decoding pro-\ncesses. On the other hand, uncoded OTA requires an advanced\ntransceiver design to achieve optimal amplitude alignment and\ncombat interference. Both approaches necessitate improved\ndesign techniques to enhance the training performance of\nOTA-FL systems.\nB. Stringent Synchronization Requirement\nThe assumption of perfect signal synchronization at the\nreceiving end has been commonly made in most existing\nOTA-FL studies [26]. However, this assumption becomes\nincreasingly challenging to achieve in scenarios with large\nsystem sizes and high heterogeneity. While some efforts have\nbeen made to address this challenge through robust design\ntechniques, such as those proposed in [89], effectively im-\nplementing synchronization in complex network environments\nremains an important and unresolved area that requires further\ninvestigation. Overcoming the synchronization challenge is\ncrucial to ensure the reliable and efﬁcient operation of OTA-\nFL in real-world wireless systems.\nC. Data Heterogeneity\nIn different OTA-FL scenarios, user data often have different\ndistributions. It is necessary to consider different, non-I.I.D.\nsettings when testing the performance of different algorithms\nto ensure a robust design. For example, the authors of [90]\ndeﬁne several non-I.I.D. distribution policies to serve as\nbenchmarks. Meanwhile, the severely unbalanced distribution\nof data often leads to the gradient importance of different\nusers, which makes some users’ updates submerged in receiver\nnoises. To this end, an adequate design of aggregation weights\nunder non-I.I.D. distributions is a vital direction in the future.\nAs a matter of fact, OTA-FL is particularly susceptible to\nunbalanced volumes of training data among different users.\nThis is because local models trained based on signiﬁcantly\nlarger amounts of local data are typically weighted higher. In12\nthe context of OTA-FL, this means the local models would be\ndelivered with much higher received powers at the server (or\nBS). A near-far effect could occur, leading to the loss of local\nmodes trained based on smaller amounts of data and delivered\nwith lower transmit powers.\nD.

Such a representation works nicely with\nalgebraic manipulations. Here we introduce a sim-\nple method to augment an attributed graph with a\nvirtual node that is bidirectionally connected to all\nexisting nodes.

In this paper, we use the recently in-\ntroduced Column Network for the expanded graph,\nresulting in a new end-to-end graph classiﬁcation\nmodel dubbed Virtual Column Network (VCN). The\nmodel is validated on two tasks: (i) predicting bio-\nactivity of chemical compounds, and (ii) ﬁnding\nsoftware vulnerability from source code.Results\nFig. 3 reports the performance on Code classiﬁcation task in\nAUC and F1-score. VCN outperforms all the baselines on\nboth measures.\n4results in a new graph classiﬁcation method called\nVirtual Column Network (VCN).

The participating devices in the federated learning system\nare regarded as different clients. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning framework with secure encryption\ntechnology, which enables multiple institutions to conduct joint machine learning modeling under the requirement of\nprotecting data privacy [ 67]. Federated learning has drawn increasing attention in both academia and industry owing to\nits potential utility in large-scale applications [ 48,85,185], which has been widely explored in the fields of healthcare\n[39, 178, 214], medical analysis [54, 97], and data security [205], etc.\nDespite the great success in homogeneous federated learning, where it heavily relies on the assumption that all the\nparticipants share the same network structure and possess similar data distributions [ 123]. However, in practical large-scale\nAuthors’ addresses: Mang Ye, yemang@whu.edu.cn; Xiuwen Fang, fangxiuwen@whu.edu.cn; Bo Du, dubo@whu.edu.cn, School of Computer Science,\nWuhan University, Wuhan, China; Pong C. Yuen, pcyuen@comp.hkbu.edu.hk, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong\nKong, China; Dacheng Tao, dacheng.tao@gmail.com, The University of Sydney, Australia.\n1arXiv:2307.10616v2  [cs.LG]  8 Sep 20232 Ye and Fang, et al.\nsituations, there may be considerable differences between data distributions, model structures, communication networks,\nand system edge devices, which make it challenging to realize federated collaboration. The federated learning associated\nwith these situations is denoted as heterogeneous federated learning, where this heterogeneity can be categorized into\nfour classes according to the federated learning process: statistical heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, communication\nheterogeneity, and device heterogeneity. These are shown in Fig. 1 and detailed as follows. 1) Statistical heterogeneity : the\ncollected data in different participants may be Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) [ 254] or unbalanced,\nresulting in inconsistent update optimization directions of participants. Original introduction, and MixUp [ 189,240].\nAdditional data can also be artificially synthesized using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [ 63]. However,\nstatistical heterogeneity of client datasets is commonly encountered in federated settings, and private data augmentation\ntechniques can be directly used to smooth the data distribution across multiple clients and mitigate statistical heterogeneity.\nFederated data augmentation typically requires users to upload a few local data samples, which increases the risk of data\nprivacy breaches. To circumvent this risk, several approaches require a proxy dataset that can represent the overall data\ndistribution of a federated system. Owing to these aspects, data augmentation in federated settings is highly challenging.\nIn a Non-IID environment with uneven data distributions on the clients, Yoon et al. [234] construct a Mean Augmented\nFederated Learning (MAFL) framework, in which clients exchange mean local data to obtain global information while\nmaintaining privacy requirements. Furthermore, they designed a data augmentation algorithm FedMix under the MAFL\nframework, which approximates the loss function of the global mixup through Taylor expansion without accessing the\nraw data of other clients. Consider the client 𝑖has a private local dataset (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖), and𝑓(,)is the model output. Therefore,\nthe approximated FedMix loss can be expressed as:\nL𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑀𝑖𝑥 =(1−𝜆)L(𝑓((1−𝜆)𝑥𝑖),𝑦𝑖)+𝜆L(𝑓((1−𝜆)𝑥𝑖),¯𝑦𝑗)+𝜆𝜕L\n𝜕𝑥¯𝑥𝑗, (3)\nwhere𝜆represents the mixup rate, and ¯𝑥𝑗and¯𝑦𝑗refer to the means of all inputs\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

GNNs consider each data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\ntasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43], and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology, LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31], and brain connectome representation [18].\n∗Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com .\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2310.04314v2  [cs.LG]  18 Dec 2023However, many LGI results are listed in Table 8.
