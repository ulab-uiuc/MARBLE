  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of deep learning and
    computer vision, with a particular focus on innovative solutions for data efficiency
    and representation learning. My recent work has explored novel techniques for
    knowledge distillation, enabling effective model compression without the extensive
    fine-tuning typically required. By leveraging label-free data, I have developed
    methods that allow compressed networks to achieve high accuracy in a fraction
    of the time and data.


    I am also passionate about harnessing the potential of radio frequency (RF) signals

    and a neural network that recognizes human actions using RF signals, even in low-light
    conditions. These contributions aim to bridge the gap between human activity recognition
    and the limitations of visual data.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges of unconditional generation in generative
    models, proposing a framework that significantly enhances generation quality without
    relying on human-annotated labels. My work on loss-resilient video conferencing
    frameworks, such as Reparo, demonstrates my commitment to improving real-time

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD)
    modeling, with a particular focus on simulating erythrocyte membranes. My recent
    work has led to the development of a two-component CGMD model that effectively
    combines the lipid bilayer and the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. This innovative approach
    allows for the exploration of both the fluidic behavior of the lipid bilayer and
    the elastic properties of the cytoskeleton, enabling simulations that cover large
    spatial and temporal scales.


    Through my research, I have gained insights into the mechanical properties of
    the erythrocyte membrane under various shear conditions. I have discovered that

    spectrin network, while at higher strain rates, the viscosity of the lipid bilayer
    plays a more significant role. Additionally, I have investigated how changes in
    the connectivity of the spectrin network affect the shear modulus of the membrane.


    My work not only enhances our understanding of erythrocyte membrane mechanics

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Autoregressive models\
    \ are currently the de facto solution to generative models in natural language\
    \ processing [38, 39, 3]. These models predict the next word or token in a sequence\
    \ based on the previous words as input. Given the discrete nature of languages,\
    \ the inputs and outputs of these models are in a categorical, discrete-valued\
    \ space. This prevailing approach has led to a widespread belief that autoregressive\
    \ models are inherently linked to discrete representations.   As a result, research\
    \ on generalizing autoregressive models to continuous-valued domains—most notably,\
    \ image generation—has intensely focused on discretizing the data [6, 13, 40].\
    \ A commonly adopted strategy is to train a discrete-valued tokenizer on images,\
    \ which involves a finite vocabulary obtained by vector quantization (VQ) [51,\
    \ 41]. Autoregressive models are then operated on the discrete-valued token space,\
    \ analogous to their language counterparts.   In this work, we aim to address\
    \ the following question: Is it necessary for autoregressive models to be coupled\
    \ with vector-quantized representations? We note that the autoregressive nature,\
    \ i.e., “predicting next tokens based on previous ones”, is independent of whether\
    \ the values are discrete or continuous. What is needed is to model the per-token\
    \ probability distribution, which can be measured by a loss function and used\
    \ to draw samples from. Discrete-valued representations can be conveniently modeled\
    \ by a categorical distribution, but it is not conceptually necessary. If alternative\
    \ models for per-token probability distributions are presented, autoregressive\
    \ models can be approached without vector quantization.   With this observation,\
    \ we propose to model the per-token probability distribution by a diffusion procedure\
    \ operating on continuous-valued domains. Our methodology leverages the principles\
    \ of diffusion models [45, 24, 33, 10] for representing arbitrary probability\
    \ distributions. Specifically, our method autoregressively predicts a vector z\U0001D467\
    zitalic_z for each token, which serves as a conditioning for a denoising network\
    \ (e.g., a small MLP). The denoising diffusion procedure enables us to represent\
    \ an underlying distribution p⁢(x|z)\U0001D45Dconditional\U0001D465\U0001D467\
    p(x|z)italic_p ( italic_x | italic_z ) for the output x\U0001D465xitalic_x (Figure 1).\
    \ This small denoising network is trained jointly with the autoregressive model,\
    \ with continuous-valued tokens as the input and target. Conceptually, this small\
    \ prediction head, applied to each token, behaves like a loss function for measuring\
    \ the quality of z\U0001D467zitalic_z. We refer to this loss function as Diffusion\
    \ Loss.      Figure 1: Diffusion Loss. Given a continuous-valued token x\U0001D465\
    xitalic_x to be predicted, the autoregressive model produces a vector z\U0001D467\
    zitalic_z, which serves as the condition of a denoising diffusion network (a small\
    \ MLP). This offers a way to model the probability distribution p⁢(x|z)\U0001D45D\
    conditional\U0001D465\U0001D467p(x|z)italic_p ( italic_x | italic_z ) of this\
    \ token. This network is trained jointly with the autoregressive model by backpropagation.\
    \ At inference time, with a predicted z\U0001D467zitalic_z, running the reverse\
    \ diffusion procedure can sample a token following the distribution: x∼p⁢(x|z)similar-to\U0001D465\
    \U0001D45Dconditional\U0001D465\U0001D467x\\sim p(x|z)italic_x ∼ italic_p ( italic_x\
    \ | italic_z ). This method eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers.\
    \    Our approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers. Vector-quantized\
    \ tokenizers are difficult to train and are sensitive to gradient approximation\
    \ strategies [51, 41, 40, 27]. Their reconstruction quality often falls short\
    \ compared to continuous-valued counterparts [42]. Our approach allows autoregressive\
    \ models to enjoy the benefits of higher-quality, non-quantized tokenizers.  \
    \ To broaden the scope, we further unify standard autoregressive (AR)\n\n    \
