  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing natural language understanding
    (NLU) and addressing the challenges posed by data scarcity in low-resource languages
    and domains. My work focuses on developing innovative cross-lingual and cross-domain
    methods to enhance model performance when training data is limited. I have explored
    various strategies, such as emphasizing task-related keywords to improve cross-lingual
    capabilities and introducing Order-Reduced Modeling techniques to adapt to linguistic
    variations.


    In my recent research, I have developed frameworks like Coach and X2Parser, which
    simplify representation learning and parsing tasks for low-resource scenarios.
    Additionally, I have tackled the issue of unseen languages in neural machine translation
    through a continual pre-training framework that enhances multilingual models like
    mBART.


    My interests also extend to cross-domain named entity recognition, where I proposed
    a model that operates without external resources, leveraging multi-task learning
    to improve robustness. I have ventured into deepfake detection, creating a pipeline
    that utilizes local forgery patterns across various domains to enhance detection
    accuracy.


    Furthermore, I have contributed to multi-behavior sequential recommendation systems
    and generative models for image detection, focusing on efficient and effective
    learning methods. My work emphasizes the importance of end-to-end models in multimodal

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Most recently, ChatGPT (OpenAI,\
    \ 2022) and its follow ups (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2023b; Google, 2023) have\
    \ led to the paradigm shift of building question answering (QA) and retrieval-augmented\
    \ generation (RAG) system in production and research community. In particular,\
    \ the following aspects of the models are preferred: i) The users can interact\
    \ with the QA models in a conversational way, thus one can easily raise follow-up\
    \ questions. ii) The models are capable of integrating retrieved chunks of evidence\
    \ in both open-domain or long document settings, where the provided context is\
    \ much longer than the context window of LLM (e.g., Anthropic, 2023a; Xu et al.,\
    \ 2023b). iii) The generalist models can answer any questions with respect to\
    \ table, arithmetic calculation in zero-shot manner without dataset-specific fine-tuning,\
    \ while matching the accuracies of fine-tuned models. To this end, we focus on\
    \ building the state-of-the-art model with all these key capabilities that are\
    \ essentially important for many real-world applications.   However, building\
    \ such a model that can match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art proprietary\
    \ models, e.g., GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), is still a grand challenge for the research\
    \ community. In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a family of open-sourced models\
    \ that can outperform GPT-4 while utilizing relatively weak open-weights foundation\
    \ model. We also open-source our training data, detailing techniques for synthetic\
    \ data generation, along with alternative human annotation processes aimed at\
    \ eliminating reliance on OpenAI GPT models for open research purpose.   Specifically,\
    \ we make the following contributions:   1.  We propose a two-stage instruction\
    \ tuning method and design a dataset curation recipe that can largely enhance\
    \ LLM’s capability of integrating user provided or retrieved context for conversational\
    \ QA and RAG tasks. We demonstrate that the proposed instruction tuning method\
    \ significantly outperforms strong alignment baselines or RLHF-based recipes (e.g.,\
    \ Llama2-Chat, Llama3-Instruct) on RAG and various conversational QA tasks.  \
    \  2.  For retrieval, we show that fine-tuning the single-turn QA retriever on\
    \ human-annotated data or synthetic multi-turn QA dataset works as well as utilizing\
    \ the state-of-the-art LLM-based query rewriting model, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI,\
    \ 2022). Our result also highlights the promising direction of utilizing synthetic\
    \ data generation for training customized retriever.    3.  We introduce ChatRAG\
    \ Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with ten conversational QA datasets, including\
    \ five datasets with long documents that need retrieval and three datasets with\
    \ tabular data and arithmetic calculation. We apply ChatQA training recipe on\
    \ different text foundation models, and show the superb generalization capability\
    \ of the proposed methods. In terms of average score on ChatRAG Bench, our ChatQA-1.0-70B (54.14)\
    \ based on Llama2 can outperform GPT-4-0613 (53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (54.03)\
    \ without utilizing any synthetic data from ChatGPT models. Notably, much smaller\
    \ Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B can perform comparable with GPT-4 models, while Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B\
    \ outperforms GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 by a margin.    4.  We study the “unanswerable”\
    \ scenario, where the LLM needs to generate “cannot answer” to avoid hallucination.\
    \ We show that incorporating a small amount of “unanswerable” samples significantly\
    \ enhances model’s capability to handle it. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo\
    \ in this regard, while has a slight gap compared to GPT-4-0613 (around 3.5%).\
    \      We discuss related work in § 2. We introduce the two-stage instruction\
    \ tuning method and data curation for ChatQA in § 3, and study retrieval in conversational\
    \ QA in § 4. We present the experimental setup in § 5, results in § 6, and conclude\
    \ the paper in § 7.     2 Related Work   2.1 Conversational QA and RAG  Question\
