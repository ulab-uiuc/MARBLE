  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of probability theory,
    economics, and algorithmic design, with a particular focus on understanding complex
    systems and their implications in real-world scenarios. My recent work has explored
    the mixing times of the one-sided k-transposition shuffle, revealing its surprisingly
    slow mixing behavior even for large values of k. This research not only enhances
    our understanding of random processes but also employs innovative techniques like
    the "lifting eigenvectors" method to analyze cutoff phenomena.


    In the realm of matching markets, I have investigated how noise in college rankings
    affects the stability of student placements. My findings highlight the contrasting
    effects of light-tailed and long-tailed distributions on matching outcomes, providing
    a nuanced view of preference formation in large markets.


    I am also passionate about addressing the misinformation crisis on social media.
    My work advocates for bridging-based ranking as a viable solution to enhance counterspeech,
    promoting content that resonates across diverse viewpoints. This approach empowers
    users and fosters healthier discourse online.


    Additionally, I have critically examined ethical concerns surrounding machine
    learning datasets, analyzing their impact on research and society. My studies
    advocate for higher ethical standards in dataset creation and management, emphasizing
    the importance of considering the entire lifecycle of data.


    Finally, I delve into the trade-offs between accuracy and diversity in recommendation
    systems, proposing models that account for user consumption constraints. This
    work provides practical insights for designing more effective and diverse recommendations,
    ultimately aiming to improve user experiences in digital environments.'

    of systems that rely on user feedback and preferences. My recent work includes
    developing a Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic role induction across multiple
    languages, which highlights the benefits of parallel corpora in enhancing semantic
    understanding. I have also investigated the optimal design of rating systems,
    demonstrating how altering the meaning and importance of rating levels can reduce
    inflation and improve the informativeness of ratings in online platforms.


    In the realm of ride-hailing, I contributed to the theoretical foundation of dynamic
    pricing mechanisms, specifically focusing on driver-side payment structures that
    enhance incentive compatibility. My research extends to the design of Service
    Level Agreements in government service allocation, where I analyze the trade-offs
    between equity and efficiency in resource distribution.


    Additionally, I have leveraged temporal dynamics in word embeddings to quantify
    societal shifts in attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities, showcasing the
    potential of machine learning in social science. My work on Alzheimer’s disease
    diagnostics emphasizes the application of machine learning techniques for early
    detection, while my studies on electoral mechanisms provide a theoretical framework
    for optimizing voter preferences in elections.


    Overall, my research aims to create principled, data-driven solutions that enhance
    decision-making processes across various domains, from public policy to social
    platforms.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  What happens when\
    \ many decision-makers—in consequential domains like employment and college admissions—all\
    \ evaluate applicants using the same algorithm? This possibility has been termed\
    \ “algorithmic monoculture”—a name that references the problems arising in agriculture\
    \ when a single crop is farmed extensively, amplifying the risk of correlated\
    \ widespread failures. A recent line of work considers how a lack of variety in\
    \ algorithms may warrant similar concerns.   Initial inquiries into the consequences\
    \ of algorithmic monoculture have identified potential harms to both decision-makers\
    \ and applicants. In seminal work initiating the formal study of algorithmic monoculture,\
    \ Kleinberg and Raghavan (2021) demonstrated that firms relying on a common algorithm\
    \ may hire weaker applicants than when using idiosyncratic (but less individually\
    \ accurate) hiring processes. On the applicant side, an emerging set of work highlights\
    \ the concern of systemic exclusion, which occurs when an applicant is denied\
    \ from all opportunities (Creel and Hellman, 2022; Bommasani et al., 2022; Toups\
    \ et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2023).   This emerging literature has been limited\
    \ by the challenge of incorporating market effects. Domains where monoculture\
    \ may be especially impactful—such as employment and college admissions—share\
    \ some common properties. First, participants on both sides of the market are\
    \ in competition: workers compete over a limited number of job openings, and firms\
    \ compete over workers who can each accept only one offer. Second, outcomes are\
    \ determined by the preferences of participants on both sides: roughly speaking,\
    \ a match is formed only if both a worker and firm prefer each other over their\
    \ other options. Analyzing these interactions across many participants can be\
    \ theoretically challenging; indeed, the existing literature considers neither\
    \ markets with many participants nor two-sided interactions.   The technical contribution\
    \ of our paper is a matching markets model that can be used to study algorithmic\
    \ monoculture. In particular, we analyze equilibrium outcomes (i.e., stable matchings)\
    \ that emerge under monoculture (when firms each use the same method to evaluate\
    \ applicants) and polyculture (when firms use idiosyncratic methods to evaluate\
    \ applicants). The model builds directly on the popular continuum model formalized\
    \ by Azevedo and Leshno (2016), in which stable matchings are characterized by\
    \ a cutoff structure in which applicants are matched to their favorite firm among\
    \ those they can “afford”—i.e., among the firms at which the applicant’s score\
    \ exceeds the firm’s cutoff. In the model we introduce, an applicant’s score is\
    \ equal to an estimated value that is a noisy realization of their true value.\
    \ Under monoculture, all firms use a single shared estimate of an applicant’s\
    \ value; under polyculture, firms obtain separate, independently drawn estimates\
    \ of the applicant’s value.   We show how modeling market effects with many participants\
    \ advances the present understanding of monoculture in several ways, with Figure 1\
    \ illustrating our first two theoretical results.   •  First, as long as noise\
    \ is well-behaved (i.e., with lighter-than-exponential tail), essentially only\
    \ the most preferred applicants are hired under polyculture when there are many\
    \ firms. This shows that the existing (relatively modest) effect found by Kleinberg\
    \ and Raghavan (2021) with two firms can be fully strengthened when considering\
    \ many firms. Our result gives a “wisdom of the crowds”-like result, where even\
    \ when individual firms are noisy, the\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n      \
