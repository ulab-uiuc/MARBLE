  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the exploration of quantum contextuality
    and its implications across various systems, particularly those involving disturbance
    and signaling. My recent work critically examines the arguments surrounding the
    extension of contextuality, challenging the notion that certain principles are
    merely non-substantive. I have developed a framework that integrates probabilistic
    causal models to address inconsistencies in contextuality, leading to the concept
    of model-based contextuality (M-contextuality). This work not only clarifies the
    relationship between contextuality and direct influences but also provides a new
    interpretation of contextuality-by-default.


    In addition to my theoretical pursuits, I have ventured into the intersection
    of cognitive science and machine learning, proposing a synergy between analogical
    reasoning and reinforcement learning. This innovative approach highlights how
    relational similarities can enhance learning algorithms, supported by simulation
    results that demonstrate its efficacy.


    My research also extends to practical applications, where I have developed robust
    non-zero priors for penalized regression models, inspired by human decision heuristics.
    This work has yielded interpretable solutions across various tasks, bridging the
    gap between complex models and simpler, more interpretable ones.


    Furthermore, I have investigated the training dynamics of neural networks in structured
    environments, revealing their capacity for anticipatory behavior when fine-tuned
    sequentially. This discovery opens new avenues for understanding how over-parameterized
    networks can effectively learn in non-IID settings.


    Overall, my work aims to deepen our understanding of contextuality, enhance cognitive
    modeling, and improve machine learning methodologies, contributing to both theoretical
    and applied domains.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like
    link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    Beyond architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space of GNNs,
    systematically studying over 315,000 designs to provide guidelines for optimizing
    performance across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON
    and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for optimal model designs, making
    the process more efficient and insightful.


    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of GNNs
    and contributing to the broader understanding of machine learning architectures,
    ultimately aiming to make these powerful tools more accessible and effective for
    real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in probabilistic modeling, Bayesian inference,
    and machine learning, with a particular focus on dynamic Bayesian networks and
    their applications. My work has explored various innovative approaches to approximate
    inference, including the development of the Factored Frontier (FF) algorithm,
    which enhances inference in dynamic settings by leveraging factored distributions.
    I have also contributed to the understanding of loopy belief propagation in Bayesian
    networks, demonstrating its effectiveness in approximating marginals across different
    architectures.


    My research extends to generative models, where I have proposed methods for image
    representation that factor in object layers and shapes, allowing for a more interpretable
    understanding of visual data. Additionally, I have investigated the challenges
    of resampling in particle filters, introducing a learned neural network resampler
    that optimizes performance in robotic localization tasks.


    I am particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and public
    health, as evidenced by my work on digital contact tracing apps for COVID-19.
    Here, I developed methods to automatically learn risk score parameters from data,
    showcasing the adaptability of machine learning models in response to evolving
    health scenarios.


    My recent endeavors also include exploring sparse Gaussian graphical models and
    their applications in relational machine learning, where I review methods for
    training statistical models on large knowledge graphs. Through my research, I
    aim to bridge the gap between complex probabilistic models and practical applications,
    contributing to advancements in both theoretical understanding and real-world
    implementations.'
