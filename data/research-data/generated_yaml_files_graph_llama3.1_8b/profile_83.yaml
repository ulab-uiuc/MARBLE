  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Graph neural networks\
    \ (GNNs) reach state of the art performance in diverse application domains with\
    \ relational data that can be represented on a graph, transferring the success\
    \ of machine learning to data on graphs [42, 11, 21, 7]. Despite their good performance,\
    \ GNNs come with the limitation of oversmoothing, a phenomenon where node features\
    \ converge to the same state exponentially fast for increasing depth [32, 40,\
    \ 27, 2]. Consequently, only shallow networks are used in practice [17, 1]. In\
    \ contrast, it is known that the depth (i.e. the number of layers) is key to the\
    \ success of deep neural networks (DNNs) [29, 30]. While for conventional DNNs\
    \ shallow networks are proven to be highly expressive [6], in practice deep networks\
    \ are much easier to train and are thus the commonly used architectures [33].\
    \ Furthermore, in most GNN architectures each layer only exchanges information\
    \ between neighboring nodes. Deep GNNs are therefore necessary to exchange information\
    \ between nodes that are far apart in the graph [9]. In this study, we investigate\
    \ oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) [17].   To study the effect\
    \ of depth, we consider the propagation of features through the network: given\
    \ some input \U0001D499α(0)superscriptsubscript\U0001D499\U0001D6FC0\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\\
    alpha}^{(0)}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_α end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ ( 0 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, each intermediate layer l\U0001D459litalic_l produces\
    \ features \U0001D499α(l)superscriptsubscript\U0001D499\U0001D6FC\U0001D459\\\
    boldsymbol{x}_{\\alpha}^{(l)}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_α end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT which are fed to the\
    \ next layer. We follow the same approach that has successfully been employed\
    \ in previous work to design trainable DNNs [34]: consider two nearly identical\
    \ inputs \U0001D499α(0)superscriptsubscript\U0001D499\U0001D6FC0\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\\
    alpha}^{(0)}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_α end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ ( 0 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and \U0001D499β(0)superscriptsubscript\U0001D499\U0001D6FD\
    0\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\beta}^{(0)}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_β end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 0 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and ask whether the intermediate\
    \ features \U0001D499α(l)superscriptsubscript\U0001D499\U0001D6FC\U0001D459\\\
    boldsymbol{x}_{\\alpha}^{(l)}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_α end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and \U0001D499β(l)superscriptsubscript\U0001D499\
    \U0001D6FD\U0001D459\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\beta}^{(l)}bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ italic_β end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ become more or less similar as a function of depth l\U0001D459litalic_l. In\
    \ the former case, the inputs may eventually become indistinguishable. In the\
    \ latter case, the inputs become less similar over layers: the distance between\
    \ them increases over layers [29, 34] until eventually it is bounded by the non-linearities\
    \ of the network. The distance then typically converges to a fixed value determined\
    \ by the network architecture, independent of the inputs.   One can therefore\
    \ identify two phases: One says that a network is regular if two inputs eventually\
    \ converge to the same value as function of l\U0001D459litalic_l; conversely,\
    \ one says that a network is chaotic if two inputs remain distinct for all depths\
    \ [22]. Neither phase is ideal for training deep networks since in both cases\
    \ all the information from the inputs is eventually lost; the typical depth at\
    \ which this happens is called the information propagation depth. However, this\
    \ propagation depth diverges at the transition between the two phases, allowing\
    \ information – in principle – to propagate infinitely deep into the network.\
    \ While these results are calculated in the limit of infinitely many features\
    \ in each hidden layer, the information propagation depth has been found to be\
    \ a good indicator of how deep a network can be trained [34]. A usual approach\
    \ for conventional DNNs is thus to initialize them at the transition to chaos.\
    \ Indeed, Schoenholz et al. [34] were able to use this approach to train fully-connected,\
    \ feedforward networks with hundreds of layers. Similar methods have recently\
    \ been adapted to the study of transformers, successfully predicting the best\
    \ hyperparameters for training [5].   In this work we address the oversmoothing\
