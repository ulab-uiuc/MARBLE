    \ a flexible framework and model class for learning unknown functions. By way\
    \ of being constructed in the language of Bayesian learning, Gaussian process\

    \ assess and propagate uncertainty in a principled manner. This makes them well-suited\

    \ .arXiv:2210.07893v4  [stat.ML]  16 Jan 2024Terenin, Burt, Artemev, Flaxman,\
    \ van der Wilk, Rasmussen, and Ge are important, including statistical applications\
    \ such as spatial modeling (Cressie, 1992), and decision- making applications\
    \ such as Bayesian optimization (Snoek et al., 2012), sensor placement (Krause\
    \ et al., 2008), and active learning (Krause and Guestrin, 2007). In many settings,\
    \ the increased availability of data and need to accurately model higher-resolution\
    \ phenomena has led to a strong interest in working with Gaussian processes at\
    \ a larger scale. Unfortunately, classical Gaussian process models generally scale\
    \ cubically with training data size due to the need to solve large linear systems\
    \ of equations. This mismatch has led to a longstanding and fruitful line of work\
    \ on scalable Gaussian processes. In the era of GPUs and automatic differentiation,\
    \ two classes of scalable approximations have been deployed within major Gaussian\
    \ process software packages, including GPflow(Matthews et al., 2017) and GPyTorch\
    \ (Gardner et al., 2018): those based on inducing point introduction of roundoff\
    \ error, algorithms which solve linear systems A−1bcan fail if the system’s solution\
    \ is too sensitive to the numerical values of Aorb. We assume throughout that\
    \ Ais symmetric positive definite, as will be the case for the kernel matrices\
    \ of interest. The key quantity used to understand how numerically stable a linear\
    \ system is the associated condition number cond(A) = lim ε→0sup ∥δ∥≤ε∥b∥\r\r\
    A−1(b+δ)−A−1b\r\r 2 ε∥A−1b∥2=\r\rA\r\r 2\r\rA−1\r\r 2=λmax(A) λmin(A)(4) of the\
    \ matrix defining the system. Here, λmaxandλminare the maximum and minimum eigenvalues,\
    \ respectively, and ∥·∥2denotes the Euclidean norm and the corresponding induced\
    \ operator norm. A linear system’s condition number quantifies how difficult it\
    \ is to solve numerically. For a given floating-point precision, if cond(A)is\
    \ small enough and the size of Ais not too large, then Cholesky factorization\
    \ is guaranteed to succeed and return an accurate matrix square root. Result 1.\
    \ LetAbe a symmetric positive definite matrix of size N×N. Assume that N > 10,\
    \ that cond(A)≤1 2−t×3.9N3/2(5) where tis the length of the floating point mantissa,\
    \ and that 3N2−t<0.1. Then floating point Cholesky factorization will succeed,\
    \ producing a matrix Lsatisfying LLT=A+E ∥E∥2≤2−t×1.38N3/2∥A∥2. (6) Proof.This\
    \ follows from Kiełbasiński (1987, Corollary 2), and the relationship between\
    \ the Euclidean and Frobenius matrix norms. See also Wilkinson (1966, Theorem\
    \ 2). For single precision arithmetic, we have 2−t≈10−7.2, and for double-precision\
    \ arithmetic, we have 2−t≈10−16. We therefore see that well-conditioned systems\
    \ of equations lead to numerically stable Cholesky factorizations. Moreover, when\
    \ an iterative algorithm is used to solve a well-conditioned system, the iteration\
    \ is often guaranteed to converge quickly, leading to computational benefits.\
    \ In particular, if one solves the linear system with the conjugate gradient algorithm\
    \ (Golub and Van Loan, 1996), then the algorithm is guaranteed to converge in\
    \ logarithmically many steps. Result 2. LetAbe a positive semi-definite matrix\
    \ of size N×N, and let ε >0. Then, in exact arithmetic, the\n\n            **Your\
