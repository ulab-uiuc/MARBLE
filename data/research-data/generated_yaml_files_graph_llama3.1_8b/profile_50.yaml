  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of machine learning,
    particularly through the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in healthcare
    and bioinformatics. My recent work focuses on developing innovative models for
    predicting dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in radiation therapy, where I introduced
    the Dose Graph Neural Network (DoseGNN). This model not only enhances prediction
    accuracy but also facilitates seamless collaboration between clinicians and AI
    through natural language processing.


    I have also explored the limitations of traditional GNNs in analyzing complex
    biological data, leading to the creation of the PathFormer architecture, which
    integrates signaling networks and omics data for improved biomarker identification
    and disease diagnosis. My research emphasizes interpretability, as seen in my
    development of the SANEpool model, which reveals essential therapeutic targets
    in drug synergy predictions.


    In addition to my work in healthcare, I have contributed to the optimization of
    directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) through the PACE framework, which enhances the
    efficiency of neural architecture search. My commitment to open science is reflected
    in my development of the Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB) for analog circuit design
    automation, promoting reproducibility and collaboration in the field.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning
    techniques and practical applications in healthcare, ensuring that AI-driven solutions
    are both effective and interpretable for real-world use.'

    (GNNs) and their applications in various domains, particularly in the context
    of foundation models. My recent work focuses on developing innovative frameworks
    that bridge the gap between traditional GNNs and the capabilities of large language
    models (LLMs). For instance, I introduced GOFA, a generative graph language model
    that integrates GNN layers with pre-trained LLMs, enabling self-supervised pretraining
    and task fluidity while maintaining graph awareness.


    I also created TAGLAS, an atlas of text-attributed graph datasets, which standardizes
    the representation of graph data and facilitates the training of graph-language
    models across diverse domains. My research has led to the development of novel
    architectures like PathFormer, which significantly improves biomarker identification
    in omics data analysis, and the Magnetic Graph Neural Network (MAG-GNN), which
    optimizes subgraph selection for enhanced expressivity without sacrificing efficiency.


    Additionally, I have explored the challenges of deep GNNs, proposing a "deep GNN,
    shallow sampler" design principle that enhances both accuracy and computational
    efficiency. My work aims to create unified models capable of addressing multiple
    graph tasks, exemplified by the One for All (OFA) framework, which leverages text-attributed

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT The expressivity of Graph Neural\
    \ Networks (GNNs) has been studied broadly in recent years to reveal the design\
    \ principles for more powerful GNNs. Graph canonization is known as a typical\
    \ approach to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, yet rarely adopted when developing\
    \ expressive GNNs. This paper proposes to maximize the expressivity of GNNs by\
    \ graph canonization, then the power of such GNNs is studies from the perspective\
    \ of model stability. A stable GNN will map similar graphs to close graph representations\
    \ in the vectorial space, and the stability of GNNs is critical to generalize\
    \ their performance to unseen graphs. We theoretically reveal the trade-off of\
    \ expressivity and stability in graph-canonization- enhanced GNNs. Then we introduce\
    \ a notion of universal graph canonization as the general solution to address\
    \ the trade-off and characterize a widely applicable suffi- cient condition to\
    \ solve the universal graph canonization. A comprehensive set ofexperiments, ESAN\
    \ is equipped with ED policy. 22results. First, we find that UGC-GNN significantly\
    \ reduces the computation complexity compared to high-order GNN PPGN, and this\
    \ observation can be explained by the O(n3)time complexity of PPGN and the large\
    \ size of graphs. On the other hand, NGNN suffers from large subgraph sizes caused\
    \ by the large average node degree in these datasets, then the extra computation\
    \ burden is also larger than popular graph datasets with small average node degree\
    \ (like OGB and TU datasets). In addition, we need to point out that ESAN with\
    \ EGO and EGO+ policy can be considered as a subgraph-based GNN. However, when\
    \ the node-deleted subgraphs (ND) and the edge-deleted subgraphs (ED) polices\
    \ are used, a graph is mapped to the set of subgraphs obtained by removing a single\
    \ node or edge, then ESAN can be understood through the marking prism. In ourAppendix\
    \ I shows that UGC-GNN can significantly reduce the computation time. Sepcifically,\
    \ UGC-GNN only requires about1 4and1 10average time per epoch compared to subgraph-based\
    \ GNN (NGNN) and high-order GNN (PPGN), respectively. The optimal solution to\
    \ the challenging gene network analysis. Table 5. Gene networks are the prevailing\
    \ data structure in Bioinformatics (Podolsky & Greene, 2011; Carew et al., 2008).\
