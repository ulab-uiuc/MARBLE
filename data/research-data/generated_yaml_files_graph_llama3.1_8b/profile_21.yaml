  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like
    link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    Beyond architectural advancements, I am passionate about understanding the broader
    design space of GNNs. My work on AutoTransfer and FALCON aims to streamline the
    process of finding optimal model designs by leveraging prior knowledge and efficiently
    navigating the design space. I believe that by systematically studying these dimensions,
    we can unlock new potentials in machine learning applications.


    Overall, my research is driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what GNNs
    can achieve, making them more effective and applicable to real-world challenges.
    I am excited about the future of this field and the opportunities it presents
    for innovation and discovery.'

    \ recent work focuses on addressing the challenges associated with ultra-low-precision\

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Denoising diffusion\
    \ models [1, 2] have emerged as powerful and effective conditional generative\
    \ models, demonstrating remarkable success in synthesizing high-fidelity data\
    \ for image generation. Saharia et al. [3] proved that these generative processes\
    \ can be applied to image restoration by feeding degraded images as conditional\
    \ input into the score network. SNIPS [4] combines annealed Langevin dynamics\
    \ and Newton’s method to arrive at a posterior sampling algorithm, exploring the\
    \ generative diffusion processes to solve the general linear inverse problems.\
    \ Based on these, many diffusion-based models were adapted for downstream image\
    \ restoration tasks [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. For traditional diffusion-based models,\
    \ the reverse process begins with Gaussian white noise, considering only the degraded\
    \ images as the conditional input. This results in an increased number of sampling\
    \ steps. Image restoration tasks often focus on restoring and editing specific\
    \ high-frequency details while preserving crucial low-frequency information, such\
    \ as the image structure. The degraded images used as conditional input inherently\
    \ contain the low-frequency information. Therefore, initiating the reverse process\
    \ from Gaussian white noise for image restoration tasks appears unnecessary and\
    \ inefficient.   Consequently, some works have proposed to generate clean images\
    \ directly from degraded images or noisy degraded images. InDI [12] restores clean\
    \ images through the reverse process of direct iteration to degraded images; DDRM [13]\
    \ reformulate the image restoration tasks as inverse problems when the mapping\
    \ between clean and degraded images is available; IR-SDE [14] directly models\
    \ the image degradation process using mean-reverting SDE (Stochastic Differential\
    \ Equations); I2SB [15] constructs a Schrödinger bridge between clean and degraded\
    \ data distributions; Resshift [16] shifts the residual term from degraded low-resolution\
    \ images to high-resolution images, performing the recovery in the latent space.\
    \ Liu et al. [17] introduced the Residual Denoising Diffusion Models (RDDM), generalizing\
    \ the diffusion process of InDI and I2SB. RDDM points out that co-learning the\
    \ residual term and the noise term can effectively improve the model performance.\
    \ However, RDDM has some limitations. Firstly, RDDM predicts the residual term\
    \ and the noise term separately, without explicitly specifying their quantitative\
    \ relationship. Secondly, due to its forward process adopting an accumulation\
    \ strategy for the residual term and the noise term, its forward and reverse processes\
    \ are inconsistent with the DDPM [1], which results in poor generalization and\
    \ interpretability. Thirdly, RDDM requires the design of a complex noise schedule,\
    \ as utilizing existing noise schedules would result in performance loss.   Figure\
    \ 1: The proposed Resfusion is a general framework for image restoration and can\
    \ be easily expand to image generation (setting x^0=0subscript^\U0001D46500\\\
