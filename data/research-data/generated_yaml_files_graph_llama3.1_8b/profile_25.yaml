  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing computer vision through innovative
    methodologies and robust datasets. My recent work focuses on creating a pipeline
    for parametrically sampling and rendering static multi-task vision datasets from
    real-world 3D scans. This initiative not only facilitates exciting research avenues
    but also demonstrates that familiar architectures can achieve state-of-the-art
    performance on various vision tasks, even when trained solely on generated data.
    Notably, my depth estimation network has surpassed existing benchmarks, and my
    surface normal estimation network has reached human-level performance on the OASIS
    benchmark.


    In addition to dataset generation, I have explored the limitations of traditional
    autoencoders in anomaly detection, particularly their tendency to overfit on complex
    datasets. By leveraging U-Net architectures and integrating puzzle-solving as
    a self-supervised learning pretext task, I have developed a framework that effectively
    mitigates overfitting and enhances feature learning. My approach employs adversarial
    robust training to automatically remove shortcuts, resulting in a stable, fast,
    and data-efficient solution that competes with the best in the field.


    Through my work, I aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in computer
    vision, providing tools and methodologies that empower researchers and practitioners
    alike.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the field of Embodied AI, focusing
    on how agents can learn to navigate and interact with dynamic environments through
    visual perception and action. My recent work emphasizes the importance of adaptive
    action modeling, as demonstrated in my development of the Action Adaptive Policy
    (AAP), which utilizes latent embeddings to dynamically adjust the impact of actions
    based on real-time environmental feedback. This approach has shown significant
    improvements in visual navigation tasks, particularly in challenging scenarios
    where traditional assumptions about action stability fail.


    I also introduced the Neural Interaction Engine (NIE), which allows agents to
    predict and manipulate their environments to enhance navigation efficiency. This
    work highlights my commitment to advancing interactive navigation capabilities,
    enabling agents to push obstacles and adapt their strategies in real-time.


    In addition to my contributions to navigation, I have developed AllenAct, a modular
    framework designed to unify the fragmented landscape of Embodied AI research.
    This framework facilitates the sharing of models and environments, making it easier
    for researchers to collaborate and innovate.


    My research extends into visual forecasting and semantic highlight retrieval,
    where I explore how agents can anticipate changes in dynamic environments and
    efficiently retrieve relevant video highlights based on textual queries. Through
    these diverse projects, I aim to push the boundaries of how embodied agents perceive
    and interact with the world, ultimately contributing to the development of more
    intelligent and adaptable AI systems.'

    Recognizing the challenges of evaluating robotic performance in varied environments,
    I created THE COLOSSEUM, a benchmark for assessing manipulation models under diverse
    perturbations. This work highlights the importance of ecological validity in robotic
    evaluations.


    Additionally, I have explored human-robot interaction, developing frameworks that
    allow robots to actively request help in navigation tasks, and I have investigated
    user comfort levels when interacting with intent-predicting AI systems. My commitment
    to understanding and improving human-robot collaboration is evident in my work
    on datasets for intent prediction and physical reasoning.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Human visual perception\
    \ is far from a passive reception of all available visual stimuli; it is an actively\
    \ tuned mechanism that operates selectively, allocating attention and processing\
    \ stimuli that are deemed relevant to the current task (Bugelski & Alampay, 1961).\
    \ An illustrative example of this phenomenon is the common experience of misplacing\
    \ one’s keys; we become subsequently oblivious to most visual cues in our environment,\
    \ except for those directly related to the search for the lost keys. In this case,\
    \ we become particularly attentive to surfaces where we usually place our keys\
    \ and navigate our environment by similarly processing the walkable areas around\
    \ us (Figure 1).   The subfield of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) studies\
    \ AI agents tasked with very analogous situations (Duan et al., 2022). Embodied\
    \ AI tasks such as navigation (Batra et al., 2020b; Krantz et al., 2023), instruction\
    \ following (Anderson et al., 2018; Krantz et al., 2020; Shridhar et al., 2020),\
    \ manipulation (Ehsani et al., 2021; Xiang et al., 2020), and rearrangement (Batra\
    \ et al., 2020a; Weihs et al., 2021a), necessitate goal-directed behaviors, such\
    \ as navigating to a specific goal or relocating target objects. Conventional\
    \ frameworks usually employ general-purpose visual backbones (Khandelwal et al.,\
    \ 2022; Yadav et al., 2023b) to extract representations from visual input. These\
    \ representations are then fused with goal embeddings (e.g., object type, images,\
    \ or natural language instructions) to construct a goal-conditioned representation\
    \ E∈ℛD\U0001D438superscriptℛ\U0001D437E\\in\\mathcal{R}^{D}italic_E ∈ caligraphic_R\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_D end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, where D\U0001D437Ditalic_D\
    \ often has dimensions as large as a 1568156815681568-dimensional Hilbert space.\
    \ E\U0001D438Eitalic_E captures an abundance of details from the visual input,\
    \ of which a policy determines which action to take next. Given E\U0001D438Eitalic_E’s\
    \ general-purpose nature, it often contains a significant amount of task-irrelevant\
    \ information. For example to find a specific object in a house, the agent doesn’t\
    \ need to know about other distractor objects in the agent’s view, about their\
    \ colors, materials, attributes, etc. These distractions introduce unnecessary\
    \ noise into the learning process, distracting the agent’s focus away from more\
    \ pertinent visual cues.   Figure 1: Selective Attention. Imagine an agent is\
    \ tasked to locate a key in an environment. Standard visual encoders such as CLIP\
    \ encoder capture general purpose scene information which include details not\
    \ relevant to the task, such as the color of the sofa or texture of the floor.\
    \ This mirrors the concept of bottom-up processing, where perception is influenced\
    \ by external stimuli in the environment. To address this, we equip the encoder\
    \ with a codebook bottleneck that only retains the most task-relevant information\
    \ such as identifying flat surfaces likely to hold the key and the walkable paths\
    \ to these surfaces. This represents top-down selective processing where the perception\
    \ is guided by internal goals and expectations.   In this paper, we draw from\
    \ the substantial body of research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience to\
    \ induce selective task-specific representations that filter irrelevant sensory\
    \ input and only retain the necessary stimuli. In Psychology, inattentional blindness\
    \ posits that people become “blind” to objects and details irrelevant to the task\
    \ at hand (as depicted by the famous invisible gorilla video on YouTube111Link\
    \ to invisible gorilla video depicting selective attention) (Simons & Chabris,\
    \ 1999). Similar studies in human visual search (Wolfe, 1994; Treisman & Gelade,\
    \ 1980) find that people become oblivious to the distracting items when searching\
    \ through a cluttered environment. The principle\n\n            **Your Task**\n\
