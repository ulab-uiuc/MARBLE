  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to understanding complex systems through the
    lens of spatiotemporal information processing, automated theorem generation, and
    multiscale molecular modeling. My work explores how neural networks can mimic
    brain functions, particularly in recognizing intricate spatiotemporal patterns.
    I developed a canonic neural network model that integrates a reservoir subnetwork
    for pattern projection and a decision-making subnetwork for temporal information
    integration, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing looming patterns and
    gait with minimal training data.


    In the realm of automated theorem proving, I identified a gap in the ability of
    generative language models to create new theorems. To address this, I proposed
    the Automated Theorem Generation (ATG) benchmark, which evaluates the capacity
    of these models to generate reusable theorems that enhance theorem proving capabilities.
    My findings indicate that high-quality ATG data significantly improves model performance,
    while also highlighting the need for further advancements in theorem generation.


    Additionally, I have tackled challenges in multiscale molecular modeling by developing
    Cycle Coarse Graining (CCG), a methodology that unifies the processes of constructing
    coarse-grained models and restoring fine molecular details. CCG employs a deep
    generative model to facilitate the exchange of information between different scales,
    ultimately enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of molecular simulations.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of logical reasoning
    and automated theorem proving, particularly through the innovative application
    of large language models (LLMs). My recent work has focused on developing novel
    frameworks and benchmarks that enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in complex
    scenarios, such as question answering and theorem generation.


    One of my key contributions is the Discourse-aware Graph Network (DAGN), which
    leverages discourse structures to improve logical reasoning in question answering
    tasks. I have also introduced the Recursive Erasure Memory Network (REM-Net),
    which refines evidence quality for commonsense reasoning by generating tailored
    evidence rather than relying solely on existing knowledge bases. My exploration
    of logical structures in question answering led to the development of logic structural-constraint
    modeling, which effectively captures passage-level logical relations.


    In addition to these frameworks, I have created benchmarks like the Automated
    Theorem Generation (ATG) benchmark and the OptiBench for evaluating LLMs'' theorem
    proving capabilities. My work on autoformalization, particularly with the FormalAlign
    framework, aims to bridge the gap between natural and formal languages, enhancing
    the scalability of mathematical reasoning.


    I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve in reasoning
    tasks, and I strive to create tools and methodologies that not only improve performance

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Formal verification\
    \ (FV), or automated program verification [35, 2] checks if a code meets a specific\
    \ demand and is correct to implement. As the code synthesis ability of current\
    \ models [28, 25, 9] evolves rapidly, there is a growing demand for automated\
    \ verification of diverse and abundant synthesis programs. However, current formal\
    \ verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers [11, 6, 22] or hand-craft\
    \ rules [39]. However, symbolic verification can not leverage the advanced reasoning\
    \ ability of current large language models (LLMs), while hand-craft rules with\
    \ limited execution on specific code cases have restricted abilities to general\
    \ verification.   On the other hand, automated theorem proving (ATP) [42, 1, 14]\
    \ is a line of work on rigorous verification with formal languages (e.g., Isabelle\
    \ [30], Lean [5]) and interactive proof environments (e.g., PISA [16], LeanDojo\
    \ [40]). Such formal languages and toolkits maintain corresponding libraries with\
    \ a large number of human-written and checked theorems and rules, which are provided\
    \ as pre-training materials for many large language models [28, 36, 15]. The ATP\
    \ formulation and rules have strong expressiveness and, therefore have a great\
    \ potential for describing formal verification problems and requests. As a result,\
    \ the verification can be implemented under a rigorous, step-wise, and interactive\
    \ ATP environment. Moreover, the pre-trained formal reasoning capabilities within\
    \ LLMs and their potential to solve formal verification problems are underexplored.\
    \   To take one step towards this goal, this paper proposes FVEL, a new formal\
    \ verification environment interacting with LLMs via automated theorem proving\
    \ processes. Figure 1 demonstrates an overview of FVEL. Specifically, the FVEL environment\
    \ takes as input a code to be verified, converts the code into Isabelle formulation,\
    \ and generates a lemma in Isabelle followed by a whole proof to the lemma. FVEL then\
    \ outputs the proof result (succeed or failed being proved) as an indication of\
    \ the code verification result. FVEL interacts with an LLM by initially providing\
    \ the converted Isabelle formulation to the LLM and then receiving the derived\
    \ lemma on the code specification. The interaction is then continued by the LLM\
    \ generating proof states and the FVEL environment providing feedback via prover\
    \ information in the PISA environment [16], such as cheating keywords sorry or\
    \ opps and other error messages. As a result, a user provides her code to be verified\
    \ to FVEL, and then she will receive the verification result and intermediate\
    \ proving information. Note that we follow previous works [6, 39] to investigate\
    \ FVEL on C code verification in this paper. We remain the extension of FVEL to\
    \ support more program languages as a near future work.   To implement the FVEL environment,\
    \ we extract and cleanse a large-scale FVELer dataset with deep dependencies,\
    \ which can be applied as both a fine-tuning resource and evaluation benchmark.\
    \ The FVELer dataset has two main components: C code dependencies formulated by\
    \ Isabelle theories, and Isabelle lemmas with their step-wise proof states. FVELer then\
    \ includes 758 theories with 29,125 lemmas and 200,646 proof steps. The dataset\
    \ is then randomly split according to lemmas, resulting in training/validation/test/test-hard\
    \ sets. The test-hard set data have dependencies that are challenging to find.\
    \ Statistical analysis shows that FVELer data comprehensively covers diverse dependency\
    \ depths and has a remarkable number of data with very deep dependencies. For\
    \ example, over 50% of lemmas have a depth greater than 78,\n\n            **Your\
