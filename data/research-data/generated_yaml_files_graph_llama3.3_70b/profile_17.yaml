    diagnosis. I proposed the Balanced True Class Probability (BTCP) framework to
    enhance uncertainty estimation, addressing the common issue of overconfidence
    in predictions.


    Additionally, I have explored graph representation learning, proposing the Graph
    Communal Contrastive Learning (gCooL) framework, which integrates community structures
    into the learning process. This approach not only improves node representation

    and practical applications, ensuring that machine learning models are both effective
    and safe for real-world use.'

    My recent work has focused on developing innovative techniques such as Cascade

    rejection sampling to create effective prefixes, resulting in five times faster
    text generation and exceptional alignment ratings.


    In addition to LLMs, I have addressed safety challenges in VLMs through a two-phase
    framework called Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA). This approach not only evaluates
    visual inputs and outputs but also aligns generative responses to enhance safety
    and helpfulness, achieving remarkable reductions in unsafe rates during cross-modality
    attacks.


    My research also extends to long-tailed classification, where I have proposed
    a principled Bayesian-decision-theory framework that unifies existing techniques
    and provides theoretical justifications for their effectiveness. This framework
    improves accuracy across all classes, particularly in tail-sensitive scenarios,
    and allows for task-adaptive decision loss.


    Furthermore, I have developed Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) to explore
    high-dimensional multimodal distributions in neural networks. This method features
    a cyclical stepsize schedule that balances exploration and characterization of
    modes, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness in learning complex distributions.


    Through these contributions, I aim to push the boundaries of multimodal intelligence
    and improve the practical applications of machine learning technologies.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The effectiveness\
    \ of Bayesian neural networks relies heavily on the quality of posterior distribution\
    \ estimation. However, achieving an accurate estimation of the full posterior\
    \ is extremely difficult due to its high-dimensional and highly multi-modal nature (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2020b; Izmailov et al., 2021). Moreover, the numerous modes in the energy\
    \ landscape typically exhibit varying generalization performance. Flat modes often\
    \ show superior accuracy and robustness, whereas sharp modes tend to have high\
    \ generalization errors (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017;\
    \ Bahri et al., 2022). This connection between the geometry of energy landscape\
    \ and generalization has spurred many works in optimization, ranging from theoretical\
    \ understanding (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Dinh et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018;\
    \ Jiang et al., 2019a) to new optimization algorithms (Mobahi, 2016; Izmailov\
    \ et al., 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020).   However, most of\
    \ the existing Bayesian methods are not aware of the flatness in the energy landscape\
    \ during posterior inference (Welling & Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al.,\
    \ 2015; Zhang et al., 2020b). Their inference strategies are usually energy-oriented\
    \ and cannot distinguish between flat and sharp modes that have the same energy\
    \ values. This limitation can significantly undermine their generalization performance,\
    \ particularly in practical situations where capturing the full posterior is too\
    \ costly. In light of this, we contend that prioritizing the capture of flat modes\
    \ is essential when conducting posterior inference for Bayesian neural networks.\
    \ This is advantageous for improved generalization as justified by previous works (Hochreiter\
    \ & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Bahri et al., 2022). It can further\
    \ be rationalized from a Bayesian marginalization perspective: within the flat\
    \ basin, each model configuration occupies a substantial volume and contributes\
    \ significantly to a more precise estimation of the predictive distribution (Bishop,\
    \ 2006). Moreover, existing flatness-aware methods often rely on a single solution\
    \ to represent the entire flat basin (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Foret et al., 2020),\
    \ ignoring the fact that the flat basin contains many high-performing models.\
    \ Therefore, Bayesian marginalization can potentially offer significant improvements\
    \ over flatness-aware optimization by sampling from the flat basins (Wilson, 2020;\
    \ Huang et al., 2020).   Prioritizing flat basins during posterior inference poses\
    \ an additional challenge to Bayesian inference. Even for single point estimation,\
    \ explicitly biasing toward the flat basins will introduce substantial computational\
    \ overhead, inducing nested loops (Chaudhari et al., 2019; Dziugaite & Roy, 2018),\
    \ doubled gradients calculation (Foret et al., 2020; Möllenhoff & Khan, 2022)\
    \ or min-max problems (Foret et al., 2020). The efficiency problem needs to be\
    \ addressed before any flatness-aware Bayesian method becomes practical for deep\
    \ neural networks.   In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm\
    \ to explicitly prioritize flat basins in the energy landscape of deep neural\
    \ networks. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable \U0001D73D\
    asubscript\U0001D73D\U0001D44E\\bm{\\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT into the Markov chain to pull model parameters \U0001D73D\
    \U0001D73D\\bm{\\theta}bold_italic_θ toward flat basins at each updating step\
    \ (Fig. 1a). \U0001D73Dasubscript\U0001D73D\U0001D44E\\bm{\\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ\
    \ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is sampled from a smoothed posterior\
    \ distribution which eliminates sharp modes based on local entropy (Baldassi et al.,\
    \ 2016) (Fig. 1b). \U0001D73Dasubscript\U0001D73D\U0001D44E\\bm{\\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ\
    \ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can also be viewed as being achieved\
    \ by Gaussian convolution, a common technique in diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein\
    \ et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019). Our method enjoys a simple joint distribution\
    \ of \U0001D73D\U0001D73D\\bm{\\theta}bold_italic_θ and \U0001D73Dasubscript\U0001D73D\
    \U0001D44E\\bm{\\theta}_{a}bold_italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT,\
