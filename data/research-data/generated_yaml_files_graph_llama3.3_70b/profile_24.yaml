  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of machine learning,
    particularly in the context of graph-based methods and deep neural networks. My
    recent work has focused on developing efficient algorithms for graph kernels,
    including the first linear time complexity randomized algorithms for unbiased
    approximation of general random walk kernels. This breakthrough allows for scalable
    computations on massive datasets, significantly outperforming previous methods.


    I have also explored innovative techniques for incorporating topological information
    into transformer models, enhancing their performance on graph-structured data.
    My research on random features has led to the development of novel mechanisms,

    the accuracy and efficiency of kernel methods across various applications.


    In addition to my work on graph algorithms, I have investigated the relationship
    between the flatness of the loss landscape in deep neural networks and their generalization
    capabilities. I propose that the volume of the parameter space mapping to a specific
    function is a more robust predictor of generalization than traditional flatness
    measures, providing a new perspective on model performance.


    My interdisciplinary approach combines theoretical insights with practical applications,
    aiming to push the boundaries of what is possible in machine learning and contribute

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to innovating methods for graph analysis and
    machine learning. My recent work introduces a novel algorithm called universal
    graph random features (u-GRFs), which leverages random walks for unbiased estimation
    of functions on weighted adjacency matrices. This approach not only addresses
    the computational challenges associated with traditional graph kernel evaluations—scaling
    from cubic to subquadratic time complexity—but also enables distribution across
    multiple machines, making it feasible to work with significantly larger networks.


    At the core of u-GRFs is a modulation function that intelligently adjusts the
    influence of different random walks based on their lengths. By integrating neural
    networks into this framework, I have demonstrated that we can achieve higher-quality
    kernel estimates and facilitate efficient kernel learning. My research is grounded
    in robust theoretical analysis, and I have validated my findings through a variety
    of experiments, including node clustering and kernel regression on triangular

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction and related work \
    \ Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling is well-established as a universal tool to\
    \ improve the convergence of MC methods, improving the concentration properties\
    \ of estimators by using low-discrepancy samples to reduce integration error (Dick\
    \ et al., 2013). They replace i.i.d. samples with a correlated ensemble, carefully\
    \ constructed to be more ‘diverse’ and hence improve approximation quality.  \
    \ Such methods have been widely adopted in the Euclidean setting. For example,\
    \ when sampling from isotropic distributions, one popular approach is to condition\
    \ that samples are orthogonal: a trick that has proved successful in applications\
    \ including dimensionality reduction (Choromanski et al., 2017), evolution strategy\
    \ methods in reinforcement learning (Choromanski et al., 2018; Rowland et al.,\
    \ 2018) and estimating sliced Wasserstein distances (Rowland et al., 2019). ‘Orthogonal\
    \ Monte Carlo’ has also been used to improve the convergence of random feature\
    \ maps for kernel approximation (Yu et al., 2016), including recently in attention\
    \ approximation for scalable Transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020). Intuitively,\
    \ conditioning that samples are orthogonal prevents them from clustering together\
    \ and ensures that they ‘explore’ ℝdsuperscriptℝ\U0001D451\\mathbb{R}^{d}blackboard_R\
    \ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT better. In specific applications\
    \ it is sometimes possible to derive rigorous theoretical guarantees (Reid et al.,\
    \ 2023b).   Less clear is how these powerful ideas generalise to discrete space.\
    \ Of particular interest are random walks on graphs, which sample a sequence of\
    \ nodes connected by edges with some stopping criterion. Random walks are ubiquitous\
    \ in machine learning and statistics (Xia et al., 2019), providing a simple mechanism\
    \ for unbiased graph sampling that can be implemented in a distributed way. However,\
    \ slow diffusion times (especially for challenging graph topologies) can lead\
    \ to poor convergence and downstream performance.   Our key contribution is the\
    \ first (to our knowledge) quasi-Monte Carlo scheme that correlates the directions\
    \ of an ensemble of graph random walkers to improve estimator accuracy. By conditioning\
    \ that walkers ‘repel’ in a particular way that leaves the marginal walk probabilities\
    \ unmodified, we are able to provably suppress the variance of various estimators\
    \ whilst preserving their unbiasedness. We derive strong theoretical guarantees\
    \ and observe large performance gains for algorithms estimating three disparate\
    \ quantities: graph kernels (Choromanski, 2023), the PageRank vector (Avrachenkov\
    \ et al., 2007) and graphlet concentrations (Chen et al., 2016).   Related work:\
    \ The poor mixing of random walkers on graphs is well-documented and various schemes\
    \ exist to try to improve estimator convergence. Most directly modify the base\
    \ Markov chain by changing the transition probabilities, but without altering\
    \ the walker’s stationary distribution and therefore leaving asymptotic estimators\
    \ (e.g. based on empirical node occupations) unmodified. The canonical example\
    \ of such a scheme is non-backtracking walks which do not permit walkers to return\
    \ to their most recently visited node (Alon et al., 2007; Diaconis et al., 2000;\
    \ Lee et al., 2012). More involved schemes allow walkers to interact with their\
    \ entire history (Zhou et al., 2015; Doshi et al., 2023). Many of these strategies\
    \ provide theoretical guarantees that the asymptotic variance of estimators is\
    \ reduced, but crucially the marginal probabilities of sampling different walks\
    \ are modified so they cannot be applied to non-asymptotic estimators that rely\
    \ on particular known marginal transition probabilities. Conversely, our QMC scheme\
    \ leaves marginal walk probabilities unmodifed. Research has also predominantly\
    \ been restricted to the behaviour of a\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n     \
