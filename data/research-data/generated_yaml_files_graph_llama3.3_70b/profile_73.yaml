  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The rapid progress\
    \ in AI-generated content (AIGC) has led to the emergence of highly sophisticated\
    \ forged face content, making it increasingly challenging for humans to distinguish\
    \ between genuine and forged faces [31, 54, 8, 6]. Face swapping, also known as\
    \ Deepfakes, is one of the most well-known techniques for generating forged facial\
    \ images. It replaces the face of a target individual with that of a source person\
    \ to create a seamless and realistic composite image [43]. The widespread proliferation\
    \ of Deepfakes content on social media platforms has raised significant security\
    \ concerns, including the spread of disinformation, fraud, and impersonation.\
    \ As a result, developing effective and generalizable face forgery detection methods\
    \ to counter these malicious attacks has become a critical challenge in the field\
    \ of computer vision.   The growing diversity of facial forgery techniques has\
    \ spurred interest in the general face forgery detection task [40, 37, 26], which\
    \ aims to develop models that detect forgeries from unseen domains. Previous approaches\
    \ primarily utilize forgery simulation [22, 35, 3, 38] to augment data by simulating\
    \ various forgery traces, or framework engineering to enhance generalization through\
    \ specialized designs like contrastive learning, attention mechanisms, and reconstruction\
    \ learning [41, 50, 39, 2, 12]. However, their generalization capabilities remain\
    \ limited due to the reliance on simulating specific forgery artifacts or designing\
    \ specialized architectures tailored to certain manipulation techniques.   In\
    \ this paper, we aim to identify the universal features common to all Deepfake\
    \ faces by revisiting the generative process underlying forged face images. As\
    \ depicted in Figure 1 (a), this process can be distilled into two key steps:\
    \ (1) a feature extractor module captures salient features from both the source\
    \ and target images; (2) these features are seamlessly fused through a generalized\
    \ feature blending module to synthesize a novel Deepfake image. While the specific\
    \ implementation of feature extraction and fusion may vary across different forgery\
    \ methods, ranging from learning-based to graphics-based approaches, they all\
    \ adhere to this fundamental generative paradigm.   Through this analysis, we\
    \ uncover a crucial insight: Deepfake images inherently amalgamate information\
    \ from both source and target faces, whereas genuine images maintain a consistent\
    \ identity throughout. This amalgamated information can manifest as low-level\
    \ artifacts, such as injection noise patterns and spectral discrepancies, or as\
    \ high-level attributes, including facial expressions and mouth movements, depending\
    \ on the specific forgery method employed.   Building upon this insight, we raise\
    \ a question: Can we invert the generative process to extract and leverage the\
    \ amalgamated source and target features, thereby enhancing the generalization\
    \ capability of existing forgery detectors?   To answer this question, we introduce\
    \ DiffusionFake, a novel plug-and-play framework that harnesses the power of Stable\
    \ Diffusion to guide the forgery detector in learning disentangled source and\
    \ target features inherent in Deepfakes. The core idea behind DiffusionFake is\
    \ to inject the features extracted by the detector into a frozen pre-trained Stable\
    \ Diffusion model, compelling the detector to capture the amalgamated source and\
    \ target information by optimizing the features to reconstruct the corresponding\
    \ source and target images.   Figure 1: Pipeline of the generation process of\
    \ Deepfake (a) and our proposed DiffusionFake (b).    As illustrated in Figure 1\
    \ (b), DiffusionFake is a plug-and-play framework that can be seamlessly integrated\
    \ into existing forgery\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
