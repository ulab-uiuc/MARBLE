  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning,
    probabilistic modeling, and explainable AI. My work spans a variety of topics,
    including neural knowledge base embeddings, variational inference, and Gaussian
    processes. Recently, I have focused on developing frameworks that integrate symbolic
    knowledge with learning processes, enabling models to handle unseen entities by
    learning from natural language descriptions, akin to human semantic learning.


    I have made significant contributions to variational Bayesian neural networks,
    introducing functional variational Bayesian neural networks (fBNNs) that maximize
    the Evidence Lower Bound directly on stochastic processes. This approach allows
    for rich prior specifications and reliable uncertainty estimates, scaling effectively
    to large datasets. My research also delves into implicit distributions, where
    I have developed novel gradient estimators and variational inference techniques
    that address challenges in high-dimensional latent variable models.


    In addition to theoretical advancements, I am passionate about practical applications.
    My work on explainable neural modules (XNMs) leverages scene graphs for structured
    reasoning, enhancing interpretability in visual reasoning tasks. I also explore
    efficient sampling strategies in discrete diffusion models, improving sample quality
    while reducing computational costs.


    Overall, my research aims to dismantle the black-box nature of complex models,
    fostering a deeper understanding of their inner workings while pushing the boundaries
    of what is possible in machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the reliability and performance
    of machine learning models, particularly in critical applications such as drug
    discovery and robotics. My recent work has focused on addressing the challenges
    of overconfident mis-predictions in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through the development
    of distance-aware GNNs, specifically GNN-SNGP. This framework not only improves
    prediction calibration but also maintains accuracy, as demonstrated through extensive
    evaluations on the CardioTox benchmark and other established datasets.


    In addition to my work on GNNs, I have explored the potential of text diffusion
    models as an alternative to autoregressive decoding for large language models
    (LLMs). My findings indicate that while diffusion models may not outperform AR
    models in all tasks, they show significant promise in areas like code synthesis
    and extractive question answering, especially when adapting existing AR models
    through our AR2Diff method.


    I am also passionate about probing the reliability of pretrained models across
    various tasks in both vision and language domains. My work on ViT-Plex and T5-Plex
    has led to state-of-the-art improvements in model reliability, simplifying the
    evaluation process and enhancing performance across multiple decision-making tasks.


    Furthermore, I am investigating the integration of vision-language models into
    end-to-end robotic control systems. By co-fine-tuning these models with robotic
    trajectory data, I aim to enable emergent semantic reasoning and improved generalization
    in robotic actions. My research is driven by a commitment to advancing the capabilities
    of AI systems, ensuring they are not only powerful but also reliable and adaptable

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Since their inception\
    \ [1, 2, 3], diffusion models have emerged as the workhorse for generative media,\
    \ achieving state-of-the-art in tasks such as image synthesis [4, 5, 6], audio [7,\
    \ 8] and video generation [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The majority of existing successes\
    \ are for continuous state space diffusions. While diffusion models have been\
    \ extended to discrete state spaces [1, 14, 15] and have been successfully applied\
    \ to applications ranging from graph generation [16], text-to-sound generation\
    \ [17] or protein design [18], they remain not as widely used as their continuous\
    \ counterparts as they are not competitive with autoregressive models in important\
    \ domains such as text modeling. This has motivated the development of continuous\
    \ space diffusion models where the discrete data are embedded in the Euclidean\
    \ space [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] or the simplex [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. We believe that\
    \ one of the reasons for the limited success of discrete diffusions is that they\
    \ have been hindered by fairly complex formulations and training objectives. This\
    \ paper is a step towards closing this gap.   In this work, we focus on “masked”\
    \ (or “absorbing”) diffusions, a discrete diffusion formulation first presented\
    \ by Austin et al. [14], and later explored by the literature from various perspectives\
    \ [29, 30, 31, 32]. We follow here a continuous-time framework which has proven\
    \ very useful to improve the training and understanding of continuous state space\
    \ diffusions [see e.g., 3, 33, 34]. We make several technical contributions which\
    \ simplify the training of these models and improve significantly their performance.\
    \ Our contributions are as follows:   •  By using elementary arguments, we establish\
    \ several properties for the forward process induced by this model and its corresponding\
    \ time reversal, improving our understanding of this model class.    •  We provide\
    \ a remarkably simple expression of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for masked\
    \ diffusion models, showing that it corresponds to a weighted integral over time\
    \ of cross-entropy losses. Similarly to continuous space diffusions [33], this\
    \ objective can be rewritten in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and exhibits invariance\
    \ properties.    •  We develop a unifying understanding of previously proposed\
    \ continuous-time discrete diffusion models [29, 35, 32], revealing the changes\
    \ they made to our ELBO objective and/or model parameterization. We show that\
    \ these changes either lead to expensive model evaluations, or large variance\
    \ in training, or breaking the consistency between forward and reverse processes.\
    \    •  On GPT-2 scale text modeling and pixel-level image modeling tasks, masked\
    \ diffusions trained using our simple ELBO objective outperform previous proposals,\
    \ leading to the best likelihood and zero-shot transfer performance among discrete\
    \ diffusion models.    •  Finally, based on our simplified masked diffusion formulation,\
    \ we propose a generalized masked diffusion model that allows state-dependent\
    \ masking schedules. This generalized masked diffusion model further improves\
    \ predictive performance on test likelihoods.        2 Masked Diffusion    Assume\
    \ our data lives in a finite discrete state space of size m\U0001D45Amitalic_m.\
    \ We use the integers 0,1,…,m−101…\U0001D45A10,1,\\dots,m-10 , 1 , … , italic_m\
