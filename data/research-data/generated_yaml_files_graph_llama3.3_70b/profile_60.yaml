  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing representation learning techniques,
    particularly in the context of time series data and materials science. My recent
    work has focused on enhancing contrastive learning methods for time series, where
    I developed SoftCLT, a novel soft contrastive learning strategy that effectively
    captures the inherent correlations within time series data. This approach has
    demonstrated significant improvements across various downstream tasks, including
    classification and anomaly detection.


    In addition to contrastive learning, I have explored masked time series modeling,
    proposing a method that emphasizes independent patch reconstruction rather than
    relying on inter-patch dependencies. This innovative approach not only enhances
    forecasting and classification performance but also optimizes efficiency in terms
    of model complexity and training time.


    Beyond time series, I have applied first-principle calculations to investigate
    the dielectric properties of few-layered MoS2, analyzing the effects of vacancies
    on dielectric screening. My findings provide valuable insights into engineering
    dielectric constants in van der Waals materials, which have implications for nanodevices
    and supercapacitors.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and
    practical applications, contributing to the fields of machine learning and materials
    science.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the fields of representation learning,
    deep learning, and computer vision. My recent work has focused on enhancing supervised
    contrastive learning through asymmetric non-contrastive learning (ANCL), leading
    to frameworks like SupSiam and SupBYOL, which effectively reduce intra-class variance
    and improve representation quality across various datasets. I have also tackled
    the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning by leveraging unlabeled
    data streams, developing a class-incremental learning scheme that significantly
    boosts accuracy and reduces forgetting.


    My exploration of deep reinforcement learning has led to innovative techniques
    that enhance generalization in unseen environments, while my work on out-of-distribution
    detection has resulted in novel training methods that improve classifier robustness.
    I have contributed to the understanding of time series representation learning
    through SoftCLT, which addresses inherent correlations in time series data, and
    I have proposed efficient methods for masked time series modeling.


    Additionally, I have investigated the intersection of supervised and unsupervised
    learning, demonstrating how augmenting neural networks with decoding pathways
    can enhance performance on supervised tasks. My research also extends to open-world
    semi-supervised learning, where I address the challenges of novel categories in
    unlabeled datasets.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    contributing to advancements in machine learning that are both robust and efficient.
    I am passionate about developing methods that not only push the boundaries of
    current technologies but also provide tangible benefits in real-world scenarios.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of time series analysis
    and representation learning. My recent work focuses on enhancing self-supervised
    learning techniques, particularly through contrastive learning strategies. I developed
    SoftCLT, a novel approach that improves the quality of learned representations
    by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive losses with soft assignments.
    This method has proven effective across various downstream tasks, including classification
    and anomaly detection, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.


    Additionally, I have explored masked time series modeling, challenging conventional
    methods by advocating for independent patch embeddings rather than relying on
    inter-patch dependencies. My approach not only simplifies the modeling process
    but also enhances forecasting and classification performance while being more
    efficient in terms of parameters and training time.


    Beyond representation learning, I have also contributed to the analysis of binary
    longitudinal data through a generalized varying-coefficient model. This model
    captures dynamic relationships and clusters varying-coefficient functions without
    overfitting, allowing for a nuanced understanding of socioeconomic predictors
    over time.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    providing robust tools for analyzing complex time series data. I am passionate
    about developing methods that are both innovative and accessible, as evidenced
    by my commitment to sharing code and resources with the research community.'

    \ can be applied in two different ways: (1) by calculating IAAT for each variable\
    \ individually, and (2) by calculating a single IAAT that considers all variables\
    \ together, which we denote as mIAAT (multivariate IAAT). Calculation of mIAAT.\
    \ First, the autocorrelation function is defined for each pair of variables at\
    \ different lags. For a multivariate TS Xl= (x1l,x2l, . . . ,xdl)withdvariables\
    \ of length L, theρat lagkfor variable pairs (i, j)is computed as ρ(i,j) k=PL−k\
    \ t=1(xil−¯xi) (xj,l+k−¯xj)qPL l=1(xil−¯xi)2PL t=1(xjl−¯xj)2, (L.1) where ¯xiand¯xjare\
    \ the means of the TS for variables iandj, respectively. Then, for each variable\
    \ X(d), IAAT is calculated by computing the sum of autocorrelations across all\
    \ lags and variables: τ(i) IAAT= 1 + 2∞X k=1dX j=1ρ(i,j) k. (L.2) To aggregate\
    \ the IAAT across multiple variables, a weighted average of the IAAT values for\
    \ in- dividual variables can be employed. In this method, the weights are determined\
    \ by the variances of the individual variables, thereby assigning greater importance\
    \ to variables with higher variance. Consequently, the IAAT for the multivariate\
    \ TS (mIAAT) can be calculated as follows: τmIAAT =Pd i=1σ2 iτ(i) IAATPd i=1σ2\
    \ i, (L.3) where σ2 iis the variance of the i-th variable. 20M Application to\

    \ of our method with other model architectures and multivariate TS, we apply our\
    \ method to CSDI [ 34], which is a score-based conditional diffusion model that\
    \ uses transformer layers for multivariate TS fore- casting and imputation. For\
    \ the experiment, we conduct a fore- casting task using Solar [ 17], M4 [ 23]\
    \ and Electricity [ 17,3], employing the CRPS as an evaluation metric and a Lin(100)\
    \ as a base schedule. Table M.1 displays the statistics of the datasets, where\
    \ D,L, and Hrepresent the number of variables, the length of the input window,\
    \ and the length of the target window, respectively. Following the original paper,\
    \ we normalize each feature to have zero mean and unit variance, and setβ1= 0.0001\
    \ andβT= 0.5for the schedule. Note that as CSDI adds noise only to certain parts\
    \ of the TS which are randomly masked with a ratio r∼Uniform(0,1) , we calculate\
    \ the IAAT with a partially noised TS by randomly masking certain series with\
    \ ratio rand only performing the forward process on the masked parts, excluding\
    \ the unmasked parts. As we use a multivariate TS dataset, we apply our method\
    \ in two ways: (1) using a common schedule across all variables (with mIAAT) where\
    \ we compute the ANT score based on Equation L.3, and (2) using a variable-specific\
    \ schedule for all variables (with IAAT). For the variable-specific schedule,\
    \ we choose a schedule with a common Tfor all variables, and Figure M.1 shows\
