  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed
    Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes
    within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction
    and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    Beyond architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space of GNNs,
    systematically studying over 315,000 designs to provide guidelines for optimal
    model selection across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON
    and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for effective neural architectures
    by leveraging prior knowledge and enhancing search efficiency.


    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of GNNs
    and making them more accessible and effective for real-world applications. I am
    excited about the future of this field and the potential for my contributions
    to inspire further innovations.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of artificial
    intelligence, programming education, and privacy in data sharing. My recent work
    focuses on leveraging generative AI and large language models to enhance computing
    education, particularly in visual programming environments. I have investigated
    the capabilities of models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in visual programming contexts,
    revealing significant challenges in their performance compared to text-based programming.


    In addition to educational applications, I have developed novel mechanisms for
    community sensing that balance privacy concerns with the need for data access,
    introducing the SeqTGreedy mechanism for budgeted participant recruitment. My
    research also delves into reinforcement learning, where I unify ensemble methods
    with social choice theory to create more effective algorithms.


    I am particularly interested in curriculum design for reinforcement learning,
    where I propose innovative strategies that adapt to the learner''s needs, enhancing
    their learning experience. My work on stochastic privacy introduces a new framework
    for managing user data sharing, allowing for personalized services while respecting
    privacy preferences.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and
    practical applications in education and data privacy, ultimately contributing
    to more effective learning environments and responsible data practices. I am committed
    to releasing my findings and tools to foster further research and development
    in these critical areas.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  The recent advances\
    \ in generative models and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to\
    \ positively impact a wide variety of domains, such as medicine [1, 2, 3], arts\
    \ [4, 5], and education [6, 7, 8, 9]. This potential is reflected by their success\
    \ on a wide range of popular competitive benchmarks assessing their knowledge\
    \ of natural sciences and day-to-day facts [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and their skills\
    \ in programming. For example, GPT-4o [10] is capable of obtaining a high accuracy\
    \ on two popular programming benchmarks: 90.2%percent90.290.2\\%90.2 % on HumanEval\
    \ [15] and 87.5%percent87.587.5\\%87.5 % on MBPP [16]. Previous studies also showed\
    \ that GPT-4 [17] is capable of passing assessments in higher education programming\
    \ courses, achieving course totals greater than 79%percent7979\\%79 % [18]   Despite\
    \ these promising results, state-of-the-art models struggle with seemingly simple\
    \ tasks. These models often underperform in tasks requiring mathematical reasoning,\
    \ planning, and problem-solving [19, 20, 21, 22]. For example, they fail to solve\
    \ planning tasks involving stacking of colored blocks [23]. Moreover, generative\
    \ models often face problems with basic algebra and counting [19], or coming up\
    \ with correct codes in visual programming domains [24], tasks which can successfully\
    \ be carried out by elementary-level school students. These weaknesses seem to\
    \ contradict the generative models’ impressive performance in programming, known\
    \ to leverage important problem-solving skills. Based on these observations, we\
    \ pose our main research question: How do state-of-the-art models perform on standardized\
    \ tests designed to assess computational thinking and problem-solving skills at\
    \ schools?   In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for assessing generative\
    \ models’ computational thinking and problem-solving capabilities. We conduct\
    \ extensive experiments with various models and our results show that state-of-the-art\
    \ models struggle with the computational thinking tests in our benchmark. Figure 1(a)\
    \ illustrates how GPT-4o barely matches the performance of an average school student,\
    \ with Llama3 [11] performing even worse.   We make the following contributions\
    \ towards improving the models’ performance on computational thinking tests: \
    \  (1) We introduce a novel data generation methodology based on symbolic methods.\
    \ An important aspect of the generated dataset is that it captures different skill\
    \ levels, ranging from recognition of visual elements to multi-choice questions\
    \ to synthesis-style tasks.  (2) We fine-tune Llama3-8B and obtain the LlamaCT\
    \ family of models, the best of which achieves an accuracy on par with GPT-4o\
    \ (see Figure 1(a)). We further analyze how various aspects of symbolic information\
    \ in our synthetic dataset help improve the fine-tuned models’ performance.  (3)\
    \ We will release the data and implementation to promote further research on enhancing\
    \ computational thinking in generative models.        (a) Performance on computational\
    \ thinking tests.      (b) A problem-solving task from HoC.       (c) A multi-choice\
    \ question task from ACE.      (d) A multi-choice question task from CT-Test.\
    \    Figure 1: (a) shows the performance of school students compared to various\
    \ models on a scale of 00 to 100100100100. We break down the ACE [25] test into\
    \ its constituent parts: Analyzing (ACE[01-07]), Evaluating (ACE[08-14]), and\
    \ Creating (ACE[15-21]). (b) shows Maze16 from Hour of Code:Maze Challenge (HoC) [26,\
