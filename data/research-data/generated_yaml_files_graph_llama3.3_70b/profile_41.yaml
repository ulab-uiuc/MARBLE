  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the field of self-supervised learning
    and generative models, particularly within the realm of computer vision and sequence
    generation. My recent work focuses on developing innovative approaches that enhance
    the adaptability and robustness of learned representations. One of my key contributions
    is the Contextual Self-Supervised Learning (ContextSSL) framework, which allows
    models to learn equivariant representations by leveraging context. This approach
    not only improves performance on equivariance-related tasks but also provides
    the flexibility to adapt to various transformations based on task-specific examples.


    In addition to my work on self-supervised learning, I have explored discrete diffusion
    models for sequence generation. I developed a novel Dirichlet flow matching framework
    that addresses the limitations of traditional methods, enabling faster and more
    controllable generation of sequences. This work has shown significant improvements
    in generating complex DNA sequences, achieving superior performance in both distributional
    metrics and design targets.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and
    practical applications, contributing to the advancement of machine learning techniques
    that are both efficient and effective across diverse tasks. I am passionate about
    pushing the boundaries of what is possible in representation learning and generative
    modeling, and I continuously seek to explore new methodologies that can enhance
    our understanding and capabilities in these areas.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of self-supervised
    learning and domain generalization within artificial intelligence. My recent work
    focuses on developing innovative algorithms that enhance the adaptability and
    robustness of models in the face of varying data transformations. One of my key
    contributions is Contextual Self-Supervised Learning (ContextSSL), which allows
    models to learn equivariant representations by leveraging a memory module that
    tracks task-specific states and transformations. This approach not only improves
    performance on equivariance-related tasks but also provides a more flexible framework
    for representation learning.


    Additionally, I have explored the concept of in-context learning, particularly
    in the context of large language models (LLMs). My work on In-Context Risk Minimization
    (ICRM) emphasizes the importance of context as a dynamic environment, demonstrating
    that models can significantly improve their out-of-distribution performance by
    adapting to incoming unlabeled examples. Through extensive theoretical and empirical
    analysis, I advocate for a paradigm shift in how researchers approach domain generalization
    and LLMs, urging them to consider the interplay between context and environment.


    Overall, my research aims to push the boundaries of how AI systems learn and generalize,
    fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive effective
    learning in complex, real-world scenarios.'

    One of my notable contributions is the extension of FrameFlow for motif-scaffolding,
