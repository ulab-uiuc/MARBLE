    \ } .  (1)   PCI faces several challenges due to the unique characteristics of\
    \ point cloud data and the complexity of modeling spatiotemporal dynamics: 1)\
    \ Point clouds are inherently sparse and unordered, lacking the regular structure\
    \ of images. For instance, NeuralPCI [1] simply concatenates spatial and temporal\
    \ coordinates as inputs to an MLP, struggling to adequately represent the motion\
    \ and correlation of multiple unordered point clouds over time. 2) PCI involves\
    \ modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of point clouds, requiring the interpolation\
    \ model ℱΘsubscriptℱΘ\\mathcal{F}_{\\Theta}caligraphic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Θ\
    \ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to capture the spatial structure and temporal evolution of\

    \ , 2 , 3 ⋯ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), and model the non-rigid deformations and non-linear\
    \ trajectories of discrete 3D points. This leads to the linear motion assumption\
    \ of PointINet [9], which uses bidirectional scene flow to warp input frames for\
    \ estimating intermediate frames, failing to capture complex non-linear motion.\
    \ Moreover, 3D scene flow estimation methods, such as 3DSFLabelling [2], PV-RAFT\
    \ [10], and NSFP [11], can only express the motion field between two frames but\
    \ cannot robustly represent higher-order dynamic scenes over longer time spans.\
