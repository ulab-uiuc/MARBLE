  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in video instance segmentation (VIS) and
    panoptic segmentation, with a focus on developing efficient and effective algorithms
    that push the boundaries of current methodologies. My recent work includes the
    development of SPINet, a single-shot panoptic segmentation model that integrates
    execution flows to generate a unified feature map, achieving high accuracy on
    benchmarks like COCO and Cityscapes.


    I have also pioneered the Inter-frame Communication Transformers (IFC), which
    enhance video instance segmentation by efficiently encoding context across frames,
    resulting in state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a fast runtime. My
    contributions extend to long-tailed object tracking, where I introduced a set
    classifier that aggregates information from multiple viewpoints, significantly
    improving tracking accuracy.


    In my pursuit of advancing VIS, I proposed VITA, a novel paradigm that leverages
    object-oriented information to enhance video-level understanding without relying
    on complex spatio-temporal features. My work on GenVIS further addresses the challenges
    of long videos by introducing a generalized framework that bridges the gap between
    training and inference, achieving remarkable results on popular benchmarks.


    I am passionate about creating practical solutions that not only achieve high
    accuracy but also maintain efficiency for real-time applications. My research
    is driven by the desire to tackle the complexities of video data and improve the
    capabilities of machine learning models in understanding dynamic visual content.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in optimization methods and their applications
    in machine learning, particularly focusing on the efficiency and performance of
    algorithms in high-dimensional settings. My recent work has led to the development
    of the Sharpened Lazy Incremental Quasi-Newton Method (SLIQN), which combines
    the strengths of existing incremental Quasi-Newton methods while achieving explicit
    superlinear convergence at a competitive computational cost. This innovation addresses
    the limitations of traditional methods, providing a more effective solution for
    large-scale optimization problems.


    In addition to optimization, I have explored the statistical advantages of convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) in vision tasks, particularly their inductive biases of
    locality and translation invariance. Through the introduction of the Dynamic Signal
    Distribution (DSD) classification task, I have demonstrated the significant sample
    efficiency of CNNs compared to locally connected and fully connected networks.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction of sequence alignment.\
    \ Within this framework, we define sequence alignment as a novel attribute, which\
    \ induces sequence models with essential features of data-dependence andextendability\
    \ . We introduce Sequence Aligned Matrices (SAM) that exhibit these properties,\
    \ demonstrating their superior performance in downstream tasks compared to non-aligned\
    \ counterparts (Section 2.2). (iii)Exploration of structured matrix parameterizations.\
    \ Through the matrix mixer framework, we systematically explore and categorize\
    \ a broad spectrum of existing sequence models (Section 2.3). Motivated by sequence\
    \ alignment, we also present new sequence models with underexplored structured\
    \ matrix configurations, such as Vandermonde and Cauchy matrices (Section 2.4).\
    \ Building on our matrix mixer framework, we introduce a novel sequence model\
    \ Hydra , which employs a quasiseparable matrix mixer (Section 3). Quasiseparable\
    \ matrices are a fundamental matrix structure with several important properties,\
    \ making them ideal for sequence modeling. For example, they generalize both the\
    \ low-rank matrix mixers found in linear attention models and the semiseparable\
    \ matrices utilized in state space models. In fact, quasiseparable matrix mixers\
    \ can be seen as a natural bidirectional extension of semiseparable matrices,\
    \ addressing a major limitation in state space models by making their use in non-causal\
    \ settings possible. Additionally, Hydra maintains the strong performance and\
    \ linear-time computational efficiency of SSMs, thanks to structured matrix multiplication\
    \ algorithms. Unlike prior attempts to make SSMs bidirectional by ad-hoc methods,\
    \ we provide PyTorch codes in Figure 6, Figure 7, Fig- ure 8, Figure 9, Figure\
    \ 10, and Figure 11. Our primary focus on this ablation is the comparison of expressivity\
    \ between different Matrix Mixers. Therefore, our implementations do not necessarily\
    \ adopt algorithms with efficient computational complexities for simplicity. The\
    \ abbreviation distands for data-independent and ddrepresents data-dependent,\
    \ in which ddvariants are equipped with the SAM property. As the Quasiseparable\
    \ variant is equivalent to the Hydra blocks, its implementation can be found in\
    \ the Python file provided in the supplementary. Further specific details are\
    \ described below. Dense. While extending Dense matrices to incorporate the SAM\
    \ attribute is not straightforward, implementing the vanilla Dense mixers ( i.e.without\
    \ SAM) is extremely simple: they are equivalent to MLP-Mixer [39], employing a\
    \ mixer matrix of R\U0001D43F×\U0001D43F. Toeplitz. Toeplitz matrix mixers without\
    \ SAM properties are equivalent to convolution operations [18, 17], formulated\
    \ withR2\U0001D43F−1parameters. We also present a Toeplitz matrix mixer with SAM\
    \ properties, thus data-dependent and can handle sequences of arbitrary lengths.\
    \ The core idea is fairly similar to the quasiseparable matrix mixer – Hydra –\
    \ that the Toeplitz matrix mixer integrates outputs from two separate forward\
    \ and reverse sequence convolutions. Specifically, for \U0001D456∈0,...\U0001D43F\
    −1, each token \U0001D465\U0001D456generates two convolution parameters \U0001D45A\
    −\U0001D456and\U0001D45A\U0001D456. Using all\U0001D45Aparameters, a data-dependent\
    \ dynamic convolutional weight is generated as {\U0001D45A−\U0001D43F+1,\U0001D45A\
    −\U0001D43F+2,...,\U0001D45A−1,\U0001D45A0,\U0001D45A1,...\U0001D45A\U0001D43F\
    −2,\U0001D45A\U0001D43F−1}. Vandermonde. In Section 2.4, we introduced the single-headed\
    \ sequence aligned Vandermonde matrix mixer. Leveraging the definition, we present\
    \ multi-headed implementation by a seamless extension. Cauchy. The constant for\
    \ preventing the denominator approaching zero is initialized to 0.0and0.5for the\
    \ diand the dd variants, respectively. Definition E.1 (Cauchy Matrix) .Given q,k∈R\U0001D43F\
