  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersections of graph data
    and language models, with a focus on developing innovative frameworks and methodologies.
    My recent work includes the Higher-Order Network Embeddings (HONE) framework,
    which allows for the effective learning of network representations by capturing
    higher-order structures through network motifs. This framework has demonstrated
    significant improvements over existing embedding methods, achieving up to a 75%
    gain in AUC across various networks.


    In addition to my work in graph embeddings, I have also delved into the realm
    of large language models (LLMs). I developed a principled abstention procedure
    that enables LLMs to confidently refrain from generating potentially erroneous
    responses. By leveraging self-consistency and conformal prediction techniques,
    my approach provides rigorous theoretical guarantees on the hallucination rate,
    ensuring that the model can effectively manage uncertainty while maintaining performance.


    Through my research, I aim to enhance the reliability and expressiveness of both
    graph-based and language-based models, contributing to the broader understanding
    of how these systems can be improved for real-world applications. I am passionate
    about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in machine learning and look
    forward to continuing this journey of discovery.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in online learning, nonparametric regression,
    and the theoretical foundations of machine learning algorithms. My work focuses
    on developing efficient algorithms that adapt to complex data environments, particularly
    in nonparametric settings. I have explored the intricacies of learning with auxiliary
    hypotheses, establishing generalization bounds that significantly improve upon
    traditional rates. My research also delves into the dynamics of overparameterized
    neural networks, where I investigate their ability to learn Lipschitz functions
    and the implications of early stopping in gradient descent training.


    I am particularly interested in the intersection of algorithmic stability and
    generalization, having established new bounds that reveal the influence of initialization
    and local curvature on learning outcomes. My contributions extend to the realm
    of transfer learning, where I propose methods for effectively combining heterogeneous
    data sources to enhance performance on target tasks. Additionally, I have made
    strides in understanding the double descent phenomenon in deep learning, providing
    insights into how model size impacts generalization.


    My recent work also includes advancements in PAC-Bayes theory, where I refine
    concentration inequalities to yield tighter guarantees for learning algorithms.

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance
    in tasks like link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My research doesn''t stop at static graphs; I have proposed the ROLAND
    framework, which enables the effective application of GNNs to dynamic graphs,
    addressing scalability and real-world evaluation challenges.


    In addition to architectural innovations, I am passionate about understanding
    the broader design space of GNNs. My work on AutoTransfer and FALCON aims to streamline
    the process of finding optimal GNN architectures for new tasks, leveraging prior
    knowledge to enhance efficiency. Through these efforts, I strive to contribute
    to the growing body of knowledge in machine learning, making GNNs more accessible
    and effective for diverse applications.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  {adjustwidth} 1cm1cm\
    \  Who’s talking? I asked, peering behind the mirror. Many dead spiders and a\
    \ lot of dust were there. Then I pressed my left eye with my index finger. This\
    \ was an old formula for detecting hallucinations, which I had read in To Believe\
    \ or Not to Believe?, the gripping book by B. B. Bittner. It is sufficient to\
    \ press on the eyeball, and all the real objects, in contradistinction to the\
    \ hallucinated, will double. The mirror promptly divided into two and my worried\
    \ and sleep-dulled face appeared in it.  —\"Monday Starts on Saturday\" by A. and\
    \ B. Strugatsky   Like the protagonist of the novel, language models too occasionally\
    \ suffer from hallucinations, or responses with low truthfulness, that do not\
    \ match our own common or textbook knowledge (Bubeck et al., 2023, Gemini Team,\
    \ Google, 2023). At the same time, since LLMs work by modeling a probability distribution\
    \ over texts, it is natural to view the problem of truthfulness through the lens\
    \ of statistical uncertainty. In this paper we explore uncertainty quantification\
    \ in LLMs. We distinguish between two sources of uncertainty: epistemic and aleatoric\
    \ (Wen et al., 2022, Osband et al., 2023, Johnson et al., 2024). Epistemic uncertainty\
    \ arises from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (e.g., facts or grammar\
    \ in the language), stemming from various reasons such as insufficient amount\
    \ of training data or model capacity. Aleatoric uncertainty comes from irreducible\
    \ randomness in the prediction problem, such as multiple valid answers to the\
    \ same query. Hence, truthfulness can be directly analyzed via looking at the\
    \ epistemic uncertainty of a model in the sense that when the epistemic uncertainty\
    \ is low, the model predictions must be close to the ground truth.   Rigorously\
    \ identifying when (either) uncertainty is small111For instance, by saying that\
    \ predictions live in a confidence set with high probability. is notoriously hard,\
    \ especially in deep neural networks (Blundell et al., 2015, Antorán et al., 2020).\
    \ This is because we generally lack guarantees about learning the ground truth\
    \ (consistency), or even a weaker guarantee about how large the variance of a\
    \ learning algorithm is. At the same time, there exist many heuristic approaches\
    \ for uncertainty quantification based on simply looking at the log-likelihood\
    \ of responses (Kadavath et al., 2022), estimating entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023),\
    \ ensembling (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017b, Dwaracherla et al., 2023, Osband\
    \ et al., 2023), or sometimes even more principled formulations, such as conformal\
    \ prediction (Angelopoulos et al., 2023, Ravfogel et al., 2023, Yadkori et al.,\
    \ 2024) (which however come with strong assumptions).   To the best of our knowledge,\
    \ a common limitation of these approaches is that they are only meaningful in\
    \ problems where there exists a single correct response (e.g. label) as they aim\
    \ for detecting if one response is dominant (or multiple responses with the same\
    \ meaning), that is, if there is only little uncertainty in the prediction. On\
    \ the other hand, when multiple responses are correct, that is, there is aleatoric\
    \ uncertainty in the ground truth, simply estimating the amount of uncertainty\
    \ in the LLM’s output is insufficient, as the perfect (ground-truth) predictor\
    \ may have large aleatoric uncertainty and no epistemic uncertainty, while a completely\
    \ useless predictor may have large epistemic uncertainty only, but the total amount\
    \ of uncertainty of the two predictors might be the same.   Contributions.  In\
    \ this paper we address the above problem directly, and design methods to decouple\
    \ epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n      \
