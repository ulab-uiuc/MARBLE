    interventions like plasticity injection to enhance adaptability without altering
    the model''s architecture. I have introduced the Hare & Tortoise framework, which
    balances rapid adaptation and gradual knowledge integration, significantly improving

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Many of the most\
    \ promising application areas of deep learning, in particular reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL), require training on a problem which is in some way nonstationary. In order\
    \ for this type of training to be effective, the neural network must maintain\
    \ its ability to adapt to new information as it becomes available, i.e. it must\
    \ remain plastic. Several recent works have shown that loss of plasticity can\
    \ present a major barrier to performance improvement in RL and in continual learning (Dohare\
    \ et al., 2021; Lyle et al., 2021; Nikishin et al., 2022). These works have proposed\
    \ a variety of explanations for plasticity loss such as the accumulation of saturated\
    \ ReLU unit and increased sharpness of the loss landscape (Lyle et al., 2023),\
    \ along with mitigation strategies, such as resetting dead unitss (Sokar et al.,\
    \ 2023) and regularizing the parameters towards their initial values (Kumar et al.,\
    \ 2023). Many of these explanations and their corresponding mitigation strategies\
    \ center around reducing drift in the distribution of pre-activations (Lyle et al.,\
    \ 2024), a problem which has historically been resolved in the supervised learning\
    \ setting by incorporating normalization layers into the network architecture.\
    \ Indeed, normalization layers have been shown to be highly effective at stabilizing\
    \ optimization in both continual learning and RL (Hussing et al., 2024; Ball et al.,\
    \ 2023).   While effective, normalization on its own is insufficient to avoid\
    \ loss of plasticity (Lee et al., 2023). Part of the reason for this lies in a\
    \ subtle property of normalization: a normalization layer causes the subnetwork\
    \ preceding it to become scale-invariant, which means that the layer’s effective\
    \ learning rate (ELR) now depends on the norm of its parameters (Van Laarhoven,\
    \ 2017). In particular, when the norm of the parameters grows, as it typically\
    \ does in neural networks trained without regularization, the effective learning\
    \ rate shrinks. While this property has been studied extensively in idealized\
    \ supervised learning settings (Arora et al., 2018), its practical implications\
    \ on optimization in nonstationary problems have previously only been noted in\
    \ the form of ‘saturation’ of normalization layers (Lyle et al., 2024).   This\
    \ work begins with an analysis of the effect of layer normalization on a network’s\
    \ plasticity, revealing two surprising benefits. We first show that when coupled\
    \ with adaptive optimizers such as Adam and RMSProp whose step size is independent\
    \ of gradient norm, saturated units still receive sufficient gradient signal to\
    \ make non-trivial changes to their parameters, providing the opportunity for\
    \ them to recover as a natural byproduct of optimization. We go on to study the\
    \ implicit learning rate schedule that layer normalization induces, arriving at\
    \ the striking observation that even without an explicit learning rate schedule,\
    \ the implicit learning rate decay induced by parameter norm growth in value-based\
    \ deep RL algorithms is in fact critical to the optimization process. This observation\
    \ yields an explanation for the dramatic performance degradations often induced\
    \ by weight decay in value-based deep RL agents: certain components of the value\
    \ function require a sufficiently small ELR in order to be learned, and an optimization\
    \ process which does not reach this value will therefore underfit the value function\
    \ in ways that can inhibit performance improvement. We further show that, while\
    \ often beneficial in single-task settings, this implicit schedule can\n\n   \
