  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to the field of 3D scene reconstruction, particularly
    focusing on the challenges of deriving detailed 3D representations from single-view
    images. My recent work introduces a novel framework that simultaneously recovers
    high-fidelity object shapes and textures, addressing the limitations of existing
    methods that often neglect fine details and object appearances. By leveraging
    Single-view neural implicit Shape and Radiance field (SSR) representations, I
    have developed a two-stage learning curriculum that integrates both 3D and 2D
    supervision, allowing for improved reconstruction accuracy.


    A distinctive aspect of my approach is its ability to generate fine-grained textured
    meshes while incorporating rendering capabilities directly into the reconstruction
    model. This innovation not only enhances the quality of 3D object reconstruction—showing
    significant improvements on benchmark datasets like 3D-FRONT and Pix3D—but also
    enables the rendering of images from novel viewpoints. My research extends beyond
    individual objects, facilitating the composition of object-level representations
    into flexible scene representations, which opens up exciting possibilities for
    holistic scene understanding and 3D scene editing.


    Through extensive experimentation, I strive to demonstrate the effectiveness of
    my methods, contributing to the advancement of 3D reconstruction technologies
    and their applications in various domains.'

    \ 78.16 4.3 Ablation Study We conduct ablative studies on the physical loss (\
    \ PL), rendering uncertainty ( RU), physical uncer- tainty ( PU), and physics-guided\
    \ pixel sampling ( PS). Tab. 2 and Fig. 7 illustrate quantitative and qualitative\
    \ comparisons, respectively. Key findings are as follows: 1.Physical loss significantly\
    \ improves 3D object stability. However, due to the insufficient regular- ization\
    \ of thin structures and imprecise contact points in simulation, adding physical\
    \ loss alone will overshadow the rendering losses, leading to degenerated object\
    \ shapes to sustain stability. 2.Rendering uncertainty, physical uncertainty,\
    \ and physic-guided pixel sampling collectively con- tribute to enhancing the\
    \ reconstruction quality, particularly on thin structures. However, despite the\
    \ advancements, the reconstructed Related Work Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction\
    \ With the increasing popularity of neural implicit rep- resentations [ 42,72,30,4,43,5,34]\
    \ in 3D reconstruction, recent studies [ 44,58,67] have bridged the volume density\
    \ in Neural Radiance Fields ( NeRF ) [39,73] with the iso-surface representation,\
    \ e.g., occupancy [ 36] or signed distance function ( SDF) [46] to enable reconstruction\
    \ from 2D images. Furthermore, advanced background, for the sake of efficient\
    \ computation in the current neural scene understanding settings. However, our\
    \ SP-MC , physical simulator and loss are designed to be compatible with multi-object\
    \ scenarios, enabling seamless extension to joint optimization for the whole scene,\
    \ ensuring versatility without loss of generality. F Potential Negative Impact\
    \ 3D scene reconstruction in general, while offering various benefits in fields\
    \ like AR/VR, robotic and Embodied AI, also raises concerns about potential negative\
    \ social impacts. Some of these impacts include potential privacy concerns in\
    \ public areas, surveillance and security risks. Addressing these concerns requires\
    \ careful consideration of ethical guidelines, regulatory frameworks, and responsible\
    \ development practices to ensure that 3D scene reconstruction is deployed in\
    \ a manner that respects privacy, security, and societal well-being. A12 Background\
