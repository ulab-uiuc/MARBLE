  profile: 'I am a researcher with a strong focus on the intricate relationships within
    the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and its implications for CP violation
    in particle physics. My work has led to significant insights into the weak CP
    phase, where I have explored its geometric origins and established constraints
    on the mixing angles and CKM matrix elements. Notably, I have calculated the maximal
    value of Jarlskog''s invariant and provided precise predictions for parameters
    like \(V_{td}\) and the angle \(\gamma\), which can be tested in future experiments.


    In addition to my work in particle physics, I have delved into the realm of stochastic
    processes, particularly the complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. My research has
    resulted in the development of new mathematical tools, such as Hermite-Laguerre-Ito
    polynomials, and has provided a deeper understanding of the relationship between
    real and complex Wiener-Ito integrals. I have also made strides in ergodicity
    for stochastic partial differential equations, addressing the challenges posed
    by complex-valued noise.


    My interdisciplinary approach combines theoretical physics with advanced mathematical
    techniques, allowing me to contribute to both the understanding of fundamental
    particles and the development of new mathematical frameworks. I am passionate
    about exploring the connections between these fields and am committed to advancing
    our understanding of the universe through rigorous research and innovative methodologies.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like
    link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    Beyond architectural advancements, I am passionate about understanding the broader
    design space of GNNs. My work on AutoTransfer and FALCON aims to streamline the
    process of finding optimal model designs, making it easier for researchers to
    leverage prior knowledge across different tasks. I believe that by systematically
    studying these design dimensions, we can unlock new potentials in machine learning
    and graph-based applications.


    Overall, my research is driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what GNNs
    can achieve, fostering a deeper understanding of their structures and enhancing
    their applicability in real-world scenarios.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Time series forecasting\
    \ is of crucial demand in real-world applications, covering various domains including\
    \ climate, economics, energy, operations, etc. [22, 43]. The growing challenges\
    \ of general-purpose forecasting, where one model is versatile to handle variable-length\
    \ scenarios [24, 41] and the prediction is necessarily instructed by auxiliary\
    \ information in other modalities [40, 44], underscore the demand for foundation\
    \ models [3] of time series, which are aimed to exhibit enhanced capabilities,\
    \ including multi-step generation, zero-shot generalization [49, 13], in-context\
    \ learning and multimodal utilization [15], thereby expanding the scope of time\
    \ series forecasting to a wider range of situations.   Nevertheless, the development\
    \ of time series foundation models has been hampered by the limited availability\
    \ of large-scale pre-training datasets and the technical uncertainty of scalable\
    \ backbones. In contrast, rapid progress is witnessed in large language models\
    \ (LLM), facilitated by extensive text corpora [50], available pre-trained models [36],\
    \ and well-established adaptation techniques [14]. Notably, language and time\
    \ series share basic commonalities in sequence modeling and generation by learned\
    \ token transitions, presenting opportunities to adopt off-the-shelf LLMs for\
    \ time series.   Despite recent studies on large language models for time series\
    \ (LLM4TS) achieving performance breakthroughs in current forecasting benchmarks [15],\
    \ the mechanism by which LLMs are aligned to the time series modality still remains\
    \ obscure. The pilot work, FPT [49] leverages LLMs as generic sequential representation\
    \ extractors for time series, influencing subsequent LLM4TS methodologies. As\
    \ depicted in Figure 1 (a), the non-autoregressive approach, where time series\
    \ are segmented into tokens, flattens and projects all lookback tokens for the\
    \ prediction in a single step. However, it causes inconsistencies in both model\
    \ structure and generative approach of LLMs: decoder-only models for autoregressive\
    \ generation are converted to encoder-only and non-autoregressive forecasters.\
    \   Given that prior studies [9, 38] reveal that generalization performance of\
    \ LLMs is largely derived from the decoder-only structure trained autoregressively,\
    \ talents of LLMs may not be fully exhibited. It is also supported by the recent\
    \ rethinking of previous LLM4TS methods [35], which generally lack the maintenance\
    \ of autoregression, the essential characteristic of both large language models\
    \ and statistical forecasters [5, 39]. Therefore, autoregressive LLM4TS methods\
    \ are underexplored, which can potentially unlock multi-step generation like LLMs,\
    \ presenting one model for arbitrary lengths.   Figure 1: (a) Prevalent LLM4TS\
    \ methods non-autoregressively generate predictions with the globally flattened\
    \ representation of lookback series, while large language models inherently predict\
    \ the next tokens by autoregression [47]. (b) Previous methods adopt language\
    \ prompts that may lead to the modality disparity, while we find time series can\
    \ be self-prompted, termed in-context forecasting.   Motivated by the reflections,\
    \ we propose AutoTimes to adapt LLMs as time series forecasters, which retrieves\
    \ the consistency of autoregression with revitalized LLM capabilities to produce\
    \ foundation models for time series forecasting. Technically, we independently\
    \ embed time series segments into the latent space of language models by the consistent\
    \ training objective: next token prediction [2]. To fully leverage the inherent\
    \ token transitions of LLMs and reduce the training cost, we freeze the LLM and\
    \ establish token embedding and projection for time series, which only account\
    \ for up to 0.1%percent0.10.1\\%0.1 % total parameters. The consequent forecaster\
    \ adopts autoregressive inference like LLMs, which is no longer constrained to\
    \ specific lookback/forecast lengths. Going beyond conventional time series forecasting,\
    \ we\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze\
