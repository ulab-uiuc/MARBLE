  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Making sure large\
    \ language models (LLMs) generate safe outputs that align with human values and\
    \ policy regulation is currently a major task for LLM practitioners. The common\
    \ tasks include the following:   1.  Removing Harmful Responses: Since LLMs are\
    \ trained on the Internet data which contain countless harmful text, they are\
    \ easy to learn problematic responses. For example, (Zhuo et al., 2023; Bai et al.,\
    \ 2022; Liu et al., 2023) have shown that LLMs can memorize harmful concepts;\
    \ such responses can cause great harm to users.    2.  Erasing Copyrighted Contents:\
    \ The tension between data owners (e.g., authors) and LLM service providers is\
    \ escalating, leading to legislation such as legal disputes involving OpenAI,\
    \ Meta, and New York Times (Small, 2023; Grynbaum and Mac, 2023; Copilot, 2023).\
    \ We have also seen a large number of recent works that show LLMs can memorize\
    \ and leak copyright-protected information (Carlini et al., 2021; Wahle et al.,\
    \ 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Removing such behaviors learned by\
    \ the LLMs as requested by the authors is important but is prohibitively expensive\
    \ if we need to retrain LLMs from scratch.    3.  Reducing Hallucinations: LLMs\
    \ often give factually wrong responses that mislead users. Reducing hallucinations,\
    \ especially in high-stakes applications, is the key to earning user trust.  \
    \  4.  Protecting User Privacy: Users might stop giving consent to the LLM service\
    \ providers for using their data. When it happens, LLM practitioners need a way\
    \ of removing the old user data from the trained LLMs.    5.  Enforcing Policy\
    \ Compliance: Local community compliance policy can iterate frequently (TikTok,\
    \ 2023; Twitter, 2023; Facebook, 2023). Practitioners need techniques to quickly\
    \ remove historical training data that leads to outputs that are no longer policy-compliant.\
    \      Though those tasks seem different, the central technical question is identical:\
    \ How to quickly remove the impact of training samples on LLMs? To this end, we\
    \ study how to perform large language model unlearning. If an LLM learns unwanted\
    \ misbehaviors in its pretraining stage, our goal is to unlearn them with samples\
    \ that represent those problematic behaviors, i.e. with only negative samples.\
    \   Figure 1: Harmful content warning. Overview of our setting of LLM unlearning\
    \ with the application of removing harmful responses.   We summarize the benefits\
    \ of LLM unlearning. (1) It only requires negative examples that we want the LLM\
    \ to forget, which are cheaper and easier to collect through user reporting or\
    \ red teaming than positive examples, which are required in the standard RLHF.\
    \ In addition, discovering negative examples is highly automatable given the pretrained\
    \ (i.e. unaligned) LLM. (2) It is computationally efficient; the cost is similar\
    \ to finetuning LLMs. (3) Unlearning is particularly effective in removing unwanted\
    \ behaviors if practitioners already know which training samples cause them. Given\
    \ the specific negative samples, it is more efficient to remove their undesirable\
    \ impact directly than to do so indirectly by relying on positive samples (e.g.\
    \ in RLHF) – if the goal is to stop generating undesirable outputs, e.g. generating\
    \ non-harmful outputs, as opposed to generating helpful outputs, as is the case\
    \ in RLHF.   We elaborate on the last benefit, which relates to our scenario.\
    \ We argue that if practitioners only have limited resources, meaning (1) they\
    \ do not have the budget to hire\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1.\
