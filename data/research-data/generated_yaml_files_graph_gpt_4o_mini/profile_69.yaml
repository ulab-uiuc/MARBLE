  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the frontiers of representation
    learning, particularly in the context of unsupervised and self-supervised methods.
    My recent work has focused on kernel-based approaches, which I believe hold significant
    potential that remains largely untapped compared to traditional neural network
    models. I have developed and analyzed several innovative kernel Self-Supervised
    Learning (SSL) models utilizing contrastive loss functions, as well as a Kernel
    Autoencoder (AE) that emphasizes the embedding and reconstruction of data.


    In my research, I challenge the conventional wisdom surrounding representer theorems
    in supervised kernel machines, proposing new theorems that are more applicable
    to self-supervised representation learning. This has allowed me to derive generalization
    error bounds for kernel SSL and AE, providing a theoretical foundation for my
    empirical evaluations. My findings demonstrate the effectiveness of these kernel-based
    methods, particularly in small data regimes, and I have rigorously compared their
    performance against neural network-based models.


    Through my work, I aim to broaden the understanding and application of representation
    learning techniques, advocating for a more diverse toolkit that includes kernel
    methods alongside neural networks. I am excited about the potential of these approaches
    to unlock new insights and capabilities in machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of causal inference,
    statistical learning, and machine learning, with a particular focus on the complexities
    of causal discovery and representation learning. My recent work explores how causal
    models can be leveraged to infer properties of unobserved joint distributions,
    emphasizing the utility of causal hypotheses in predicting statistical properties
    rather than merely seeking "true" causal relationships. I have developed methods
    for falsifying causal discovery outputs, highlighting the importance of compatibility
    across variable subsets, which provides a robust framework for model selection.


    In addition, I have investigated the challenges posed by unobserved confounding
    in regression analysis, deriving consistent estimators for confounding strength
    and demonstrating the necessity of stronger regularization in causal learning
    compared to statistical learning. My research also extends to kernel-based clustering
    and the optimality of kernel methods in high-dimensional settings, where I have
    established necessary conditions for consistent recovery of true clusters.


    I am particularly interested in ordinal embedding, where I have contributed to
    the development of fast algorithms that scale to large datasets, enabling effective
    representation learning from triplet comparisons. My work aims to bridge theoretical
    insights with practical applications, providing a comprehensive understanding
    of how causal and statistical learning can inform each other in complex data environments.
    Through my research, I strive to advance the field of machine learning by addressing
    fundamental challenges and proposing innovative solutions that enhance our understanding
    of causal relationships and data representation.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT Despite the growing popularity\
    \ of explainable and interpretable machine learn- ing, there is still surprisingly\
    \ limited work on inherently interpretable clusteringmethods on the synthetic\
    \ datasets “Pathbased”, “Aggregation” and “Flame” (Fränti & Sieranoja) which have\
    \ k= 3,k= 7andk= 2clusters respectively. We start with linear k-means and IMM\
    \ on all three, and then run kernel k-means with both the Laplace as well as the\
    \ Gaussian kernel over a range of hyperparameters γ, choosing the best agreement\
    \ with the ground truth as our starting point for Kernel IMM. When the Gaussian\
    \ kernel is chosen, we run Kernel IMM both on the surrogate Taylor features from\
    \ Definition 3 with M= 5, as well as on the surrogate features based on the kernel\
    \ matrix, as defined in Equation (4), and choose the better one. We then refine\
    \ the partition induced by Kernel IMM using both Kernel ExKMC as well as Kernel\
    \ Expand, constructing m= 6,m= 10 andm= 4 leaves respectively. Note that at every\
    \ step, Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand only need to check the cost of the threshold\
    \ cuts at the new nodes (obtained from the previous iteration). Thus, adding mleaves\
    \ to an existing tree with pleaves amounts to p+ 2miterations over all possible\
    \ threshold cuts. We follow the same procedure for the two real world datasets.\
    \ In Iris(Fisher, 1936), there are three classes with 50observations each. Every\
    \ class refers to a type of iris plant. As illustrated in the barplot included\
    \ in Section 6, kernel k-means slightly improves over k-means and this translates\
    \ to Kernel IMM, Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand. The Wisconsin breast cancer dataset\
    \ consists of 569observations of benign and malignant cells. The 30-dimensional\
    \ features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei observed in each image.\
    \ Interestingly, IMM exactly replicates its suboptimal reference k-means clustering.\
    \ Kernel k-means better identifies the ground truth, and Kernel IMM approximates\
    \ it well (even achieving a slightly higher agreement with the ground truth).\
    \ The same is true for Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand. Kernel IMM for the χ2kernel.\
    \ The additive χ2kernel is evaluated on a toy dataset obtained from a mixture\
    \ model of four discrete distributions, with values in four bins. Figure 6 shows\
    \ a plot of the different distributions. For all four distribution, we draw 5instances\
    \ of 100random samples, and compute the fraction of observations in each bin for\
    \ every instance (thus n= 20 andd= 4). We repeat this procedure 100times. We find\
    \ that the χ2kernel achieves a Rand index that is consistently higher than the\
    \ one of k-means (see Figure 6). This is not very surprising: The denominator\
    \ of the 20Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 1 2 3 40.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0Probability4\

    \ Plot Figure 6: We cluster samples drawn from a mixture model of four discrete\
    \ distributions by checking the fraction of observations in each of four bins.\
    \ The true underlying probabilities are shown in the left plot. Over 100draws\
    \ of samples, the χ2kernel improves over standard k-means in recovering the ground\
    \ truth, as the boxplot on the right shows. χ2kernel accounts for the overall\
    \ number of observations in each bin, penalizing deviations in less probable bins\
    \ more than in frequently visited bins — a nonlinear characteristic that standard\
    \ k-means lacks. To provide some more intuition on how Kernel IMM constructs interpretable\
