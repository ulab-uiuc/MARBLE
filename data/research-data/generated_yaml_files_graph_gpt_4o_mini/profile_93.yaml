    and the mathematical modeling of random processes. My recent work has focused
    on understanding the growth of pseudobulges in stellar discs, where I utilized
    simulations to explore how various parameters, such as disc-to-halo mass ratios
    and halo concentrations, influence morphological transitions and bulge prominence.
    I developed a robust formula relating bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to the
    disc''s contribution to gravitational acceleration, which aligns well with observational
    data and enhances semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.


    In addition to my astrophysical research, I have delved into the realm of Markov
    processes, proposing a novel data-driven method for learning these models through
    spectral decomposition of the infinitesimal generator. My approach addresses the
    challenges posed by traditional methods, particularly in terms of computational
    efficiency and robustness to time-lag variations. By leveraging the resolvent
    of the infinitesimal generator, I have significantly reduced the complexity of
    eigenvalue learning, making it applicable to a wider class of Markov processes.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Dynamical systems\
    \ and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) provide a general mathematical\
    \ framework to study natural phenomena, with broad applications in science and\
    \ engineering. Langevin SDEs, the main focus of this paper, are widely used to\
    \ simulate physical processes such as protein folding or catalytic reactions [see\
    \ e.g. 44, and references therein]. A main objective is to describe the dynamics\
    \ of the process, forecast its evolution from a starting state, ultimately gaining\
    \ insights on macroscopic properties of the system.   In molecular dynamics, the\
    \ motion of a molecule is sampled according to a potential energy U⁢(x)\U0001D448\
    \U0001D465U(x)italic_U ( italic_x ), where the state vector x\U0001D465xitalic_x\
    \ represents the positions of all the atoms. Specifically, the Langevin equation\

    \ italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - ∇ italic_U ( italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t\
    \ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_d italic_t + italic_σ italic_d italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT describes the stochastic behavior of the system at\
    \ thermal equilibrium, where Xtsubscript\U0001D44B\U0001D461X_{t}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the random position of the state at time t\U0001D461\
    titalic_t, the scalar σ\U0001D70E\\sigmaitalic_σ is a multiple of the square root\
    \ of the system’s temperature, and Wtsubscript\U0001D44A\U0001D461W_{t}italic_W\
    \ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is a vector random variable describing\
    \ thermal fluctuations (Brownian motion). Most often, the atoms evolve in metastable\
    \ states that are separated by barriers which can hardly be crossed during a simulation.\
    \ For instance, for a protein the free energy barrier between the folded and unfolded\
    \ states is larger than thermal agitation, making the transition between the two\
    \ states a rare event. Consequently, long trajectories need to be simulated before\
    \ such interesting events are observed. In fact, one needs to observe many events\
    \ to get the relevant thermodynamics (free energy) and kinetics (transition rates)\
    \ information [33]. Beyond molecular dynamics, the slow mixing behavior of many\
    \ systems modeled by SDEs is a major bottleneck in the study of rare events, and\
    \ so designing methodologies which can accelerate the process is paramount.  \
    \ A general idea to overcome the above problem is to perturb the system dynamics.\
    \ One important approach which has been put in place in molecular dynamics is\
    \ the so-called \"bias potential enhanced sampling\" [25, 42, 11]. The main idea\
    \ is to add to the potential energy a bias potential V\U0001D449Vitalic_V, thereby\
    \ lowering the barrier and allowing the system state to be explored more rapidly.\
    \ To make this approach tractable in large systems, V\U0001D449Vitalic_V is often\
    \ chosen as a function of a few wisely selected variables called collective variables\
    \ (CVs). For instance, if a chemical reaction involves a bond breaking, physical\
    \ intuition suggests to choose the distance between the reactive atoms [26, 28].\
    \ However, for complex processes, hand-crafted CVs might be \"suboptimal\", meaning\
    \ that some of the degrees of freedom important for the transition are not taken\
    \ into account, making the biasing process inefficient.   In recent years, machine\
    \ learning approaches have been employed to find the most relevant CVs [8, 40,\
    \ 14, 9, 10, 4, 27]. A key idea is to use available dynamical information to construct\
    \ the CVs [39, 30, 7, 40]. For instance, if one can identify the slowest degrees\
    \ of freedom of the system, one can accurately describe the transitions between\
    \ metastable states. These\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
