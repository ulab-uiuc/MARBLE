  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing the security and privacy challenges
    posed by deep learning technologies, particularly in the context of deepfakes,
    data poisoning, and model watermarking. My recent work has focused on developing
    innovative solutions to enhance the robustness and reliability of machine learning
    models against malicious attacks. For instance, I introduced Pivotal Tuning Watermarking
    (PTW), a method that allows for efficient watermarking of pre-trained generators,
    significantly improving the speed and effectiveness of watermarking while preserving
    image quality.


    I have also explored the vulnerabilities of deep image classification models to
    data poisoning attacks, revealing a critical trade-off between detectability and
    robustness. My research emphasizes the need for effective defenses that can both
    detect and repair poisoned models, demonstrating that larger models are often
    more susceptible to detection but also more robust against attacks.


    In addition, I have contributed to the field of Private Set Intersection (PSI)
    protocols, proposing efficient solutions that maintain privacy while allowing
    for meaningful data analysis. My work on differential privacy and its application
    to PSI has led to protocols that optimize communication and computation complexity,
    making them practical for large datasets.


    Through my research, I aim to raise awareness of the inherent risks in machine
    learning systems and to develop methodologies that enhance their security and
    trustworthiness. I am committed to advancing the understanding of these complex
    issues and providing robust solutions that can be applied in real-world scenarios.'

    and accuracy of k-means clustering while ensuring robust privacy protections.
    I have developed innovative solutions that significantly reduce computational

    during inference. By co-designing activation functions with polynomial approximations,
    I achieved significant speed-ups in inference times while maintaining competitive
    accuracy.


    Most recently, I introduced RHODE, a system that enables privacy-preserving training
    and prediction on recurrent neural networks in a federated learning context. This
    work not only preserves data confidentiality but also mitigates potential attacks,
    showcasing my commitment to advancing secure and efficient machine learning methodologies.

    and classify adversary knowledge. This foundational work has provided insights
    into the complexities of threat models and the effectiveness of various attack
    strategies.


    In addition to adversarial machine learning, I have contributed to the evolutionary

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Deepfakes are images\
    \ synthesized using deep image generators that can be difficult to distinguish\
    \ from real images. While deepfakes can serve many beneficial purposes if used\
    \ ethically, for example, in medical imaging (Akrout et al., 2023) or education (Peres\
    \ et al., 2023), they also have the potential to be misused and erode trust in\
    \ digital media. Deepfakes have already been used in disinformation campaigns (Boneh\
    \ et al., 2019; Barrett et al., 2023) and social engineering attacks (Mirsky &\
    \ Lee, 2021), highlighting the need for methods that control the misuse of deep\
    \ image generators.   Watermarking offers a solution to controlling misuse by\
    \ embedding hidden messages into all generated images that are later detectable\
    \ using a secret watermarking key. Images detected as deepfakes can be flagged\
    \ by social media platforms or news agencies, which can mitigate potential harm (Grinbaum\
    \ & Adomaitis, 2022). Providers of large image generators such as Google have\
    \ announced the deployment of their own watermarking methods (Gowal & Kohli, 2023)\
    \ to enable the detection of deepfakes and promote the ethical use of their models,\
    \ which was also declared as one of the main goals in the US government’s “AI\
    \ Executive Order” (Federal Register, 2023).   A core security property of watermarking\
    \ is robustness, which states that an attacker can evade detection only by substantially\
    \ degrading the image’s quality. While several watermarking methods have been\
    \ proposed for image generators (Wen et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Fernandez\
    \ et al., 2023), none of them are certifiably robust (Bansal et al., 2022) and\
    \ instead, robustness is tested empirically using a limited set of known attacks.\
    \ Claimed security properties of previous watermarking methods have been broken\
    \ by novel attacks (Lukas et al., 2022), and no comprehensive method exists to\
    \ validate robustness, which causes difficulty in trusting the deployment of watermarking\
    \ in practice. We propose testing the robustness of watermarking by defining robustness\
    \ using objective function and approaching adaptive attacks as an optimization\
    \ problem. Adaptive attacks are specific to the watermarking algorithm used by\
    \ the defender but have no access to the secret watermarking key. Knowledge of\
    \ the watermarking algorithm enables the attacker to consider a range of surrogate\
    \ keys similar to the defender’s key. This also presents a challenge for optimization\
    \ since the attacker only has imperfect information about the optimization problem.\
    \ Adaptive attackers had previously been shown to break the robustness of watermarking\
    \ for image classifiers (Lukas et al., 2022), but attacks had to be handcrafted\
    \ against each watermarking method. Finding attack parameters through an optimization\
    \ process can be challenging when the watermarking method is not easily optimizable,\
    \ for instance, when it is not differentiable. Our attacks leverage optimization\
    \ by approximating watermark verification through a differentiable process. Figure 1\
    \ shows that our adaptive attacker can prepare their attacks before the provider\
    \ deploys their watermark. We show that adaptive, learnable attackers, whose parameters\
    \ can be optimized efficiently, can evade watermark detection for 1 billion parameter\
    \ Stable Diffusion models at a negligible degradation in image quality.   Figure\
    \ 1: An overview of our adaptive attack pipeline. The attacker prepares their\
    \ attack by generating a surrogate key and leveraging optimization to find optimal\
    \ attack parameters θ\U0001D49Csubscript\U0001D703\U0001D49C\\theta_{\\mathcal{A}}italic_θ\
    \ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_A end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (illustrated here as an\
    \ encoder ℰℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E and decoder \U0001D49F\U0001D49F\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D)\
    \ for any message. Then, the attacker generates watermarked images and applies\
    \ a modification using their optimized attack to evade\n\n            **Your Task**\n\
