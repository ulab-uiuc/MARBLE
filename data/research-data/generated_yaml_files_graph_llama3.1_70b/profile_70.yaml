  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Machine learning\
    \ models usually learn from user data where data privacy has to be respected.\
    \ Certain laws, such as European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),\
    \ are in place to ensure “the right to be forgotten”, which requires corporations\
    \ to erase all information pertaining to a user if they request to remove their\
    \ data. It is insufficient to comply with such privacy regulation by only removing\
    \ user data from the dataset, as machine learning models can memorize training\
    \ data information and risk information leakage [1, 2]. A naive approach to adhere\
    \ to this privacy regulation is to retrain the model from scratch after every\
    \ data removal request. Apparently, this approach is prohibitively expensive in\
    \ practice for frequent data removal requests and the goal of machine unlearning\
    \ is to perform efficient model updates so that the resulting model is (approximately)\
    \ the same as retraining statistically. Various machine unlearning strategies\
    \ have been proposed, including exact [3, 4, 5, 6] and approximate approaches [7,\
    \ 8, 9, 10, 11]. The later approaches allow a slight misalignment between the\
    \ unlearned model and the retraining one in distribution under a notion similar\
    \ to Differential Privacy (DP) [12].   The most popular approach for privatizing\
    \ machine learning models with DP guarantee is arguably noisy stochastic gradient\
    \ methods including the celebrated DP-SGD [13]. Mini-batch training is one of\
    \ its critical components, which not only benefits privacy through the effect\
    \ of privacy amplification by subsampling  [14] but also provides improved convergence\
    \ of the underlying optimization process. Several recent works [9, 11] based on\
    \ full-batch (noisy) gradient methods may achieve certified approximate unlearning.\
    \ Unfortunately, their analysis is restricted to the full-batch setting and it\
    \ is non-trivial to extend these works to the mini-batch setting with tight approximate\
    \ unlearning guarantees. The main challenge is to incorporate the randomness in\
    \ the mini-batch sampling into the sensitivity-based analysis [9] or the Langevin-dynamics-based [11]\
    \ analysis.   We aim to study mini-batch noisy gradient methods for certified\
    \ approximate unlearning. The high-level idea of our unlearning framework is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1. Given a training dataset \U0001D49F\U0001D49F\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D\
    \ and a fixed mini-batch sequence ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}caligraphic_B, the model first\
    \ learns and then unlearns given unlearning requests, both via the projected noisy\
    \ stochastic gradient descent (PNSGD). For sufficient learning epochs, we prove\
    \ that the law of the PNSGD learning process converges to a unique stationary\
    \ distribution ν\U0001D49F|ℬsubscript\U0001D708conditional\U0001D49Fℬ\\nu_{\\\
    mathcal{D}|\\mathcal{B}}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_D | caligraphic_B\
    \ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Theorem 3.1). When an unlearning request arrives, we update\
    \ \U0001D49F\U0001D49F\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D to an adjacent dataset \U0001D49F\
    ′superscript\U0001D49F′\\mathcal{D}^{\\prime}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT so that the data point subject to such request is removed.\
