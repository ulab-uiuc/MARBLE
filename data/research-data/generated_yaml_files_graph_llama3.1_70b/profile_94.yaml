  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of computer vision
    and generative models, particularly focusing on text-to-image and text-to-video
    synthesis. My recent work has led to significant advancements in customizing generative
    models, such as the development of the Still-Moving framework, which allows for
    text-to-video customization without the need for specialized video data. This
    framework leverages lightweight Spatial Adapters to integrate the spatial characteristics
    of customized text-to-image models into video generation, demonstrating effectiveness
    across various tasks.


    Additionally, I introduced Lumiere, a text-to-video diffusion model that synthesizes
    coherent motion through a novel Space-Time U-Net architecture, achieving state-of-the-art
    results in video generation. My research also addresses the limitations of existing
    diffusion models by proposing techniques like Generative Semantic Nursing (GSN),
    which enhances the fidelity of generated images by refining the model''s attention
    mechanisms.


    I am particularly interested in improving model robustness and interpretability.
    My work on foreground-background relevance in visual classification models has
    shown promising results in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. Furthermore,
    I have explored the use of explainability techniques in Transformer architectures,
    providing novel methods to visualize and understand model predictions.


    Through my research, I aim to push the boundaries of generative modeling and enhance
    the practical applications of AI in creative and analytical domains. My work is

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Generative models have\
    \ demonstrated unprecedented ca- pabilities to create high-quality, diverse imagery\
    \ based on textual descriptions [2,11,34,37,40]. While revolutionary, re- cent\
    \ works have demonstrated that these models often suffer from heavy reliance on\
    \ biases [7, 28] and occasionally also data memorization [3, 42]. However, all\
    \ these works draw conclusions by a simple external evaluation of the output images,\
    \ while research on understanding the internal repre- sentations learned by the\
    \ model remains scarce. Thus, our understanding of these impressive models remains\
    \ limited. In this work, we aim to develop a method to interpret the inner representations\
    \ of text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach draws inspiration from the field\
    \ of concept-based interpretability [16, 21, 24], which proposes to interpret\
    \ the modelâs decision-making for a given input by decomposing it into a set of\
    \ elements that impact the prediction ( e.g., de- composing âcatâ into âwhiskersâ\
    \ ,âpawsâ ,etc.). Under 1arXiv:2306.00966v3  [cs.CV]  5 Oct 2023this setting,\
    \ an âinterpretationâ can be considered to be a mapping function from the internal\
    \ state of the model to a set of concepts humans can understand [21]. Notably,\
    \ ex- isting approaches for concept-based interpretability are not directly applicable\
    \ to generative models, and, as we demon- strate, fall short of producing meaningful\
    \ interpretations for such models. Therefore, we propose a novel method to produce\
    \ concept-based explanations for diffusion models, which leverages their unique\
    \ structure and properties. Our method, CONCEPTOR , learns a pseudo-token , re-\
    \ alized as a combination of interpretable textual elements (Fig. 1(a)). To obtain\
    \ the pseudo-token, CONCEPTOR trains a neural network to map each word embedding\
    \ in the vocab- ulary of the model to a corresponding coefficient, with the objective\
    \ of denoising the concept images. The pseudo-token is then constructed as a linear\
    \ combination of the top vocab- ulary elements weighted by their learned coefficients.\
    \ This formulation allows us to exploit both the modelâs powerful ability to link\
    \ between text and image, and the rich semantic information encapsulated in the\
    \ text encoder. Through a large battery of Related Work Text-guided image generation\
    \ Recently, impressive re- sults were achieved for text-guided image generation\
    \ with large-scale auto-regressive models [34, 46] and diffusion models [29, 33,\
    \ 37, 40]. In the context of text-to-image dif- fusion models, a related line\
    \ of work aims to introduce per- sonalized concepts to a pre-trained text-to-image\
    \ model by learning to map a set of images to a âtokenâ in the text space of the\
    \ model [12, 23, 39]. Importantly, these methods violate the meaningfulness criterion.\
    \ We note that meaningfulness is a critical criterion for an interpretation, as\
    \ without it, humans cannot understand the decomposition, and it does not serve\
    \ its basic goal of giving insights into the model. Original Images PCA Component\
