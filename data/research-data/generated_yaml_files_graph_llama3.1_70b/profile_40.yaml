  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
    and stochastic games, with a focus on decentralized systems and the challenges
    they present. My work primarily revolves around developing algorithms that enable
    independent learners to converge to optimal policies in complex environments.
    I have made significant contributions to the understanding of non-stationarity
    in MARL, proposing asynchronous variants of decentralized Q-learning that relax
    the need for synchronized updates, thus broadening the applicability of these
    algorithms.


    My research also delves into the structure of weakly acyclic games and their generalizations,
    exploring how agents can employ experimental strategies to navigate multi-agent
    settings effectively. I have introduced the concept of $\epsilon$-satisficing
    paths, which provides a framework for independent learners to approximate equilibrium
    in stochastic games, leveraging the inherent symmetry in multi-player scenarios.


    Additionally, I have investigated mean-field games from a decentralized learning
    perspective, establishing conditions under which control problems can be modeled
    as fully observed Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or partially observed MDPs
    (POMDPs). This work culminated in the development of a decentralized learning
    algorithm that drives agents toward subjective Q-equilibrium, enhancing our understanding
    of emergent behaviors in systems of independent learners.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    contributing to the advancement of algorithms that can operate effectively in
    decentralized and dynamic environments.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.


    In addition to static graphs, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs
    through the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static
    GNNs to dynamic environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning
    (AutoML), where I introduced methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer to improve the
    efficiency of model design searches by leveraging prior knowledge across tasks.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    providing scalable solutions that enhance the performance of GNNs across a variety
    of domains. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve
    and contributing to the broader understanding of their design and functionality.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in distributed optimization and game theory,
    with a particular focus on generalized Nash equilibria (GNE) in multi-agent systems.
    My recent work has explored innovative algorithms for achieving GNE in settings
    where players have limited information and can only communicate with their neighbors
    over networks. I have developed several distributed algorithms that leverage primal-dual
    methods and monotone operator theory to ensure convergence to GNE, even in the
    presence of partial information and coupled constraints.


    One of my key contributions is the introduction of a passivity-based approach
    to enhance convergence properties in reinforcement learning and multi-agent games.
    I have also investigated the robustness of distributed algorithms against adversarial
    agents and communication failures, ensuring that my methods remain effective in
    real-world scenarios.


    My research extends to asynchronous algorithms that efficiently utilize local
    computation resources, allowing agents to operate without centralized coordination.
    I have demonstrated the effectiveness of my algorithms through extensive numerical
    simulations, showcasing their applicability in various contexts, including wireless
    networks and social media behavioral models.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in game
    theory and practical applications in distributed systems, contributing to the
    development of robust, efficient algorithms for complex multi-agent interactions.'

    linear systems over noisy communication channels. My work has explored the stochastic
    stability of these systems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for
    their stabilizability, even in the presence of Gaussian noise. I have developed
    innovative coding and control policies that ensure closed-loop systems remain
    stochastically stable, extending existing results for both linear and non-linear
    systems.


    My research also delves into optimal causal coding for partially observed Markov
    processes, where I have established structural results that enhance our understanding
    of decentralized coding strategies. I have introduced a dynamic programming framework
    for sequential stochastic control problems, which has led to new existence results
    for optimal policies in decentralized settings.


    Recognizing the limitations of traditional assumptions in stochastic processes,
    I have investigated non-Markovian processes and their stability properties, contributing

    \ reinforcement learning [24], and adversarial model training [7], among many\
    \ others.   In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), players use learning\
    \ algorithms to revise their strategies in response to the observed history of\
    \ play, producing a sequence {\U0001D431^t}t≥1subscriptsubscript^\U0001D431\U0001D461\

    \ structure of multi-agent systems, each player’s learning problem involves a\
    \ moving target: since an individual’s reward function depends on the strategies\
    \ of the others, strategy revision by one agent prompts other agents to revise\
    \ their own strategies. Convergence analysis of MARL algorithms can therefore\
    \ be difficult, and the development of tools for such analysis is an important\
    \ aspect of multi-agent learning theory.   A strategy profile (x∗i)i=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptsubscript\U0001D465\

    \ is called a Nash equilibrium if all players simultaneously best respond to one\
