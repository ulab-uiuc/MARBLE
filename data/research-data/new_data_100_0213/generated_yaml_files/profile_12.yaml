  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing medical diagnostics through advanced
    machine learning techniques, particularly in the realm of brain neoplasm detection
    using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). My work has led to the development of
    an innovative preprocessing technique that significantly improves the area of
    interest in MRI data, coupled with a hybrid approach that combines Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    for classification. By modifying the SVM''s cost function, I have addressed the
    critical issue of false positive predictions, enabling more accurate detection
    of both malignant and benign neoplasms.


    In addition to my work in medical imaging, I am also exploring the intersection
    of big data and healthcare information retrieval. I have proposed an intelligent,
    interactive system that leverages vast medical data repositories to enhance the
    precision of medical information searches. My recent research delves into the
    potential of large language models (LLMs) in ranking tasks, where I have developed
    a pairwise few-shot ranker that improves performance over traditional zero-shot
    methods. This work demonstrates my commitment to simplifying complex processes
    while maintaining high accuracy in medical and information retrieval applications.
    Overall, my research aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning
    techniques and practical medical applications, ultimately improving patient outcomes
    and access to critical health information.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of information retrieval
    and natural language processing, with a particular focus on the application of
    large language models (LLMs) in enhancing retrieval systems. My recent work has
    explored innovative approaches to generative relevance feedback, where I applied
    LLMs in both zero-shot and pseudo-relevance feedback settings, demonstrating significant
    performance improvements in retrieval tasks.


    I have also investigated the vulnerabilities of modern sequence-to-sequence relevance
    models to adversarial attacks, revealing how prompt injection can manipulate relevance
    scores. This research highlights the need for robust evaluation methods in retrieval
    systems, especially as neural ranking models (NRMs) become more prevalent. My
    findings indicate that while NRMs are powerful, they can be susceptible to semantic
    perturbations, prompting me to propose strategies to mitigate these weaknesses.


    Additionally, I have delved into the paradigm of in-context learning (ICL), drawing
    parallels between ICL and information retrieval to optimize the selection of few-shot
    examples for downstream tasks. My work aims to redefine relevance in this context,
    enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs in practical applications.


    Through my research, I strive to push the boundaries of how we understand and
    utilize LLMs in retrieval, advocating for more efficient algorithms and robust
    models that can withstand adversarial challenges while improving user experience

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1. Introduction\n\nResearch on\
    \ large language models (OpenAI, 2023) (LLMs) is expanding in scope and yielding\
    \ significant scientific advancements rapidly. These language models are pre-trained\
    \ on large corpora of documents to capture the inherent semantics of text in a\
    \ generic task-independent manner. Common pre-training methodologies either involve\
    \ a masked language model (MLM) that predicts randomly masked tokens from the\
    \ text (Devlin et\_al., 2019a; Liu et\_al., 2019; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019),\
    \ or an auto-regressive model or causal language model (CLM)\nwhich predicts a\
    \ token only from its predecessor tokens (Radford et\_al., 2019; Brown et\_al.,\
    \ 2020; Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2022). While MLM is employed in BERT (Devlin et\_\
    al., 2019a) and its successors, such as RoBERTa (Liu et\_al., 2019), BART (Lewis\
    \ et\_al., 2020a) etc., the latter class of models, i.e., CLM, is applied to train\
    \ GPT variants (Radford et\_al., 2019; Brown et\_al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and\
    \ open-source Llama and Mistral variants (Touvron et\_al., 2023; Jiang et\_al.,\
    \ 2023) etc.\nLLMs, when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have\
    \ demonstrated to be\nadaptable to a broad set of tasks\ndue to instruction tuning\
    \ (Ouyang et\_al., 2022),\nin the sense that they are not only able to produce\
    \ semantically correct and coherent text but are also able to adapt themselves\
    \ surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs, commonly\
    \ called prompts (Arora et\_al., 2022).\n\n\nThis ability to adapt to unseen data\
    \ and tasks with only a small number of examples differs from the standard notion\
    \ of supervised learning, where the parameters of a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT\
    \ (Devlin et\_al., 2019a)) is then again learned (commonly referred to as \u2018\
    fine-tuning\u2019) from a training set of labelled examples. Instead, in few-shot\
    \ learning or in-context learning (ICL), a small number of labelled examples from\
    \ a training set are simply appended to a prompt instruction to control the text\
    \ generation in a desirable way beneficial to the downstream task (Mysore et\_\
    al., 2023; Li et\_al., 2022; Ni et\_al., 2021; Pradeep et\_al., 2023a). In addition\
    \ to leveraging ICL for a purely generative task, e.g., question answering or\
    \ abstractive summarisation (Brown et\_al., 2020; Li et\_al., 2023; Tang et\_\
    al., 2023), a more common use is in a predictive task, such as text classification\
    \ (Lu et\_al., 2022; Milios et\_al., 2023), where each class is specified by a\
    \ set of words (commonly called a verbaliser (Schick and Sch\xFCtze, 2021)), e.g.,\
    \ for a binary sentiment classification task the positive class could be defined\
    \ by the set {{\\{{\u2018good\u2019, \u2018great\u2019, \u2018wonderful\u2019\u2026\
    }}\\}}.\nOnce each class for a predictive task is well-defined, the generated\
    \ text can be mapped to the most likely class(es) by using the posterior over\
    \ the vocabulary generated by the decoder.\n\n\nIt is to be realised that ICL\
    \ is somewhat conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k\U0001D458\
    kitalic_k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the\
    \ local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels\
    \ (called few-shot examples) - the only difference of ICL with k\U0001D458kitalic_k-NN\
    \ is that the former involves a frozen set of encoder-decoder parameters of an\
    \ underlying LLM, where ICL generally works well on any domain with only a small\
    \ number of examples because, unlike\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n        \
