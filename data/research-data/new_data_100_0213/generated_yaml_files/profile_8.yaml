  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance
    in tasks like link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My research doesn''t stop at static graphs; I proposed the ROLAND framework
    to effectively handle dynamic graphs, allowing for scalable and efficient training
    methods that adapt to real-world scenarios.


    In addition to architectural innovations, I have explored the design space of
    GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 different configurations to provide
    guidelines for optimal model design. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON
    and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the process of finding effective neural architectures

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nState-of-the-art\
    \ LLMs such as GPT-4\_(Achiam et\_al. 2023), Gemini\_(Team et\_al. 2023), Llama-3\_\
    (Meta 2024), and Claude-3 Sonnet\_(Anthropic 2024) achieve remarkable performance\
    \ through pre-training on large amounts of internet texts and rigorous alignment\
    \ process for safety enhancement.\nDespite the immense effort in safety research,\
    \ LLMs are still vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks and can exhibit unwanted\
    \ behaviors\_(Shah et\_al. 2023; Chao et\_al. 2023; Zou et\_al. 2023b; Jones et\_\
    al. 2023; Yuan et\_al. 2024; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2024).\n\n\nMachine\
    \ Unlearning\_(Cao and Yang 2015; Chris Jay\_Hoofnagle and Borgesius 2019; Bourtoule\
    \ et\_al. 2021; Nguyen et\_al. 2022; Xu et\_al. 2023; Liu et\_al. 2024c) has emerged\
    \ as a promising method for mitigating unforeseen risks in LLMs before deployment.\n\
    Li et\_al. (2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014\
    an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples\
    \ that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the\
    \ representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember)\
    \ unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks,\
    \ while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates\
    \ stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason\
    \ for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development\
    \ of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\
    \n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\
    \n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness.\
    \ We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal\
    \ updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness\
    \ of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss,\
    \ which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and\
    \ a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget\
    \ representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective\
    \ when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome\
    \ RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively\
    \ adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation.\
    \ Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy\
    \ for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and\
    \ enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational\
    \ overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\
    \nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without\
    \ the forget samples. However, this method becomes more computationally expensive\
    \ as the size of datasets and modern deep networks grows. Existing works focus\
    \ on approximating unlearning\_(Warnecke et\_al. 2021; Izzo et\_al. 2021; Sekhari\
    \ et\_al. 2021; Isonuma and Titov 2024) using Influence Function\_(Koh and Liang\
    \ 2017; Grosse et\_al. 2023), gradient projection\_(Bae et\_al. 2023), gradient\
    \ ascent\_(Thudi et\_al. 2022; Trippa et\_al. 2024), second-order approximation\_\
    (Jia et\_al. 2024), preference optimization\_(Zhang et\_al. 2024b), and embedding\
    \ corrupted\_(Liu et\_al. 2024a). Other views on the landscape of machine unlearning\
    \ include: unlearning in text classification\_(Ma et\_al. 2022), image classification\
    \ and recognition\_(Ginart et\_al. 2019; Golatkar, Achille, and Soatto 2020; Fan\
    \ et\_al. 2024; Choi and Na 2023; Cha et\_al. 2024), image-to-image generative\
    \ models\_(Li et\_al. 2024a), diffusion models\_(Gandikota et\_al. 2023; Zhang\
    \ et\_al. 2024a; Kumari et\_al. 2023), multimodal unlearning\_(Cheng and Amiri\
    \ 2023), federated unlearning\_(Liu et\_al. 2020a; Romandini et\_al. 2024; Wang\
