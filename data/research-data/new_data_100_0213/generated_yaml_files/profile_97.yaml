  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy gains across multiple prediction benchmarks.
    Recognizing the challenges posed by dynamic graphs, I proposed the ROLAND framework,
    which allows static GNNs to be adapted for dynamic environments, enhancing their
    scalability and performance.


    In addition to architectural advancements, I have explored the intricate relationship
    between neural network structures and their predictive performance through relational
    graphs. My work aims to systematically study the design space of GNNs, providing
    guidelines for selecting optimal architectures for specific tasks. I am also passionate
    about improving the efficiency of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods,
    as demonstrated by my development of FALCON and AutoTransfer, which leverage design
    graphs to streamline the search for optimal model configurations.

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nDeep learning practitioners\
    \ commonly regard recurrent ar-\nchitectures as the default starting point for\
    \ sequence model-\ning tasks. The sequence modeling chapter in the canonical\n\
    textbook on deep learning is titled \u201CSequence Modeling:\nRecurrent and Recursive\
    \ Nets\u201D (Goodfellow et al., 2016),\ncapturing the common association of sequence\
    \ modeling\nand recurrent architectures. A well-regarded recent online\ncourse\
    \ on \u201CSequence Models\u201D focuses exclusively on recur-\nrent architectures\
    \ (Ng, 2018).\n1Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon Univer-\nsity, Pittsburgh,\

    \ <vkoltun@gmail.edu >.On the other hand, recent research indicates that certain\
    \ con-\nvolutional architectures can reach state-of-the-art accuracy\nin audio\
    \ synthesis, word-level language modeling, and ma-\nchine translation (van den\
    \ Oord et al., 2016; Kalchbrenner\net al., 2016; Dauphin et al., 2017; Gehring\
    \ et al., 2017a;b).\nThis raises the question of whether these successes of con-\n\
    volutional sequence modeling are con\uFB01ned to speci\uFB01c ap-\nplication domains\
    \ or whether a broader reconsideration of\nthe association between sequence processing\
    \ and recurrent\nnetworks is in order.\nWe address this question by conducting\
    \ a systematic empiri-\ncal evaluation of convolutional and recurrent architectures\n\
    on a broad range of sequence modeling tasks. We specif-\nically target a comprehensive\
    \ set of tasks that have been\nrepeatedly used to compare the effectiveness of\
    \ different\nrecurrent network architectures. These tasks include poly-\nphonic\
    \ music modeling, word- and character-level language\nmodeling, as well as synthetic\
    \ stress tests that had been de-\nliberately designed and frequently used to benchmark\
    \ RNNs.\nOur evaluation is thus set up to compare convolutional and\nrecurrent\
    \ approaches to sequence modeling on the recurrent\nnetworks\u2019 \u201Chome\
    \ turf\u201D.\nTo represent convolutional networks, we describe a generic\ntemporal\
    \ convolutional network (TCN) architecture that is\napplied across all tasks.\
    \ This architecture is informed by\nrecent research, but is deliberately kept\
    \ simple, combining\nsome of the best practices of modern convolutional archi-\n\
    tectures. It is compared to canonical recurrent architectures\nsuch as LSTMs and\
    \ GRUs.\nThe Background\nConvolutional networks (LeCun et al., 1989) have been\n\
    applied to sequences for decades (Sejnowski & Rosen-\nberg, 1987; Hinton, 1989).\
    \ They were used prominently\nfor speech recognition in the 80s and 90s (Waibel\
    \ et al.,\n1989; Bottou et al., 1990). ConvNets were subsequently\napplied to\
    \ NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and\nsemantic role labelling (Collobert\
    \ & Weston, 2008; Col-\nlobert et al., 2011; dos Santos & Zadrozny, 2014). More\n\
    recently, convolutional networks were applied to sentence\nclassi\uFB01cation\
    \ (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014) and\ndocument classi\uFB01cation (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2015; Conneau et al.,\n2017; Johnson & Zhang, 2015; 2017). Particularly\
    \ inspiring\nfor our work are the recent applications of convolutional\narchitectures\
    \ to machine translation (Kalchbrenner et al.,\n2016; Gehring et al., 2017a;b),\
    \ audio synthesis (van den\nOord et al., 2016), and language modeling (Dauphin\
    \ et al.,\n2017).\nRecurrent networks are dedicated sequence models that\nmaintain\
    \ a vector of hidden activations that are propagated\nthrough time (Elman, 1990;\
    \ Werbos, 1990; Graves, 2012).\nThis family of architectures has gained tremendous\
    \ pop-\nularity due to prominent applications to language mod-\neling (Sutskever\
    \ et al., 2011; Graves, 2013; Hermans &\nSchrauwen, 2013) and machine translation\
    \ (Sutskever et al.,\n2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). The intuitive appeal of re-\n\
    current modeling is that the hidden state can act as a rep-\nresentation of everything\
    \ that has been seen so far in the\nsequence. Basic RNN architectures are notoriously\
    \ dif\uFB01cult\nto train (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al.,\n\n          \
