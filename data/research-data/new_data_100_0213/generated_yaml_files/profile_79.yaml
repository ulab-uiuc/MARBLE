  profile: 'As a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, my work primarily
    revolves around the development of ethical and explainable AI decision support
    systems (AI-DSS). I advocate for a framework I call the RCC approach, which emphasizes
    the importance of providing human decision-makers with three essential types of
    explanations: reasons, counterfactuals, and confidence. My recent publications
    delve into the empirical landscape of explainable AI (XAI), critically analyzing
    existing methods like LIME, SHAP, and Anchors, and their impact on user trust
    and decision accuracy.


    I have identified gaps in current theories regarding what constitutes effective
    human-grounded explanations, leading me to propose a novel theory of human-machine
    interaction known as epistemic quasi-partnerships (EQP). This theory not only
    clarifies the empirical evidence surrounding model explanations but also provides
    ethical guidance for the development of AI systems. My goal is to bridge the gap
    between AI capabilities and human understanding, ensuring that AI technologies
    are not only powerful but also trustworthy and aligned with human values. Through
    my research, I aim to foster a more collaborative relationship between humans
    and AI, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes across various domains.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nArtificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) systems\u2014often based on machine learning (ML) models\u2014are increasingly\n\
    used to support decision-makers, even in high-stakes domains like healthcare and\
    \ finance. Given\nthe complexity of AI systems, it is often suggested that decision-makers\
    \ could benefit from access\nto explanations of their predictions. The hope is\
    \ that such explanations will help decision-makers\nreason about when and when\
    \ not to rely on the AI system\u2019s predictions, achieving appropriate\nreliance\
    \ [4]. However, across many domains, empirical studies of explanations have produced\
    \ mixed RELATED WORK AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nFirst, we overview related work on\
    \ explainable AI (XAI), focusing on XAI for ML models\u2014what is\nsometimes\
    \ referred to as interpretability in the ML literature [ 27,57]. We then overview\
    \ why XAI is\nbelieved to be useful for human-AI decision-making and gaps in the\
    \ community\u2019s understanding.\n2.1 Overview of XAI\nGiven the increasing use\
    \ of AI and ML systems, there is a growing need for people interacting with\n\
    these systems to understand the underlying models. The technical field of explainable\
    \ AI (XAI)\ngrew out of these concerns. A diverse set of XAI conclusions about\
    \ their precise relations and impact on decisions.\nWe also acknowledge the trade-off\
    \ of a two-phase study design that showed participants the\nsame set of instances\
    \ in both phases. While this design allowed us to analyze cases where the\nhuman-alone\
    \ decisions agree or disagree with the AI predictions separately, this design\
    \ may have\nstrengthened, in some cases, participants\u2019 prior intuition more\
    \ than a realistic human-AI decision-\nmaking setting. That being said, we do\
    \ not foresee any type of intuition to be contingent on the\nset-up of our study\
    \ design.\nOur study was also limited by the choice of decision tasks and explanation\
    \ METHODS\nWe describe the set-up of our study and analysis, the two prediction\
    \ tasks that we asked participants\nto engage with, and the types of explanations\
    \ they were shown. We then overview our experimental\ndesign and study procedure\
    \ and discuss the approaches used to analyze the data collected during\nour study.\
    \ We note that participation was voluntary and the study was IRB approved.\n3.1\

    \ we chose to start with a\nconvenience sampling strategy and then diversify our\
    \ selection from a large pool of sign-ups based\non their background shapes perceptions\
