  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am also passionate about exploring the structural dynamics of neural networks.
    My work on relational graphs has unveiled critical insights into how the architecture
    of neural networks influences their predictive performance, leading to the identification
    of optimal configurations that mirror biological neural networks.


    In addition, I have pioneered frameworks like ROLAND, which facilitate the adaptation
    of static GNNs to dynamic environments, and FALCON, an efficient method for automated
    model design that leverages a design graph to optimize performance across tasks.
    My research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical
    applications, providing scalable solutions that can be readily implemented in
    real-world scenarios.


    Overall, my goal is to push the boundaries of GNN research, making significant
    contributions that not only advance the field but also empower practitioners to
    harness the full potential of graph-based learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the safety and efficiency of
    neural networks, particularly in the context of out-of-distribution (OOD) data
    detection and knowledge distillation. My recent work includes the development
    of WeShort, a post-hoc technique designed to mitigate the overconfidence of neural
    networks when faced with OOD inputs. This method leverages the internal residual
    structures of networks and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
    like ImageNet.


    In addition to OOD detection, I have explored self-knowledge distillation (SKD),
    proposing a novel approach that distills knowledge from multilevel abstraction
    features, which has shown significant effectiveness across various tasks and model
    architectures. My commitment to improving model efficiency is further reflected
    in my research on contrastive image-text models, where I introduced innovative
    greedy search methods for token pruning in Vision Transformers (ViT). This work
    not only reduces computational demands but also maintains high performance levels,
    achieving a minimal accuracy loss while significantly decreasing the number of
    patch tokens.


    Through these contributions, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced neural architectures
    and their practical deployment, ensuring that they are both robust and efficient
    in real-world applications. My research is driven by a passion for making machine
    learning models safer and more accessible, and I am excited to continue exploring
    new frontiers in this dynamic field.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of computer vision
    and machine learning, with a particular focus on vision-language models and their
    applications. My recent work has explored the robustness of prompt tuning in models
    like CLIP, revealing how fixed classname tokens and powerful pre-trained embeddings
    contribute to improved performance, even in the presence of label noise. I have
    also tackled challenges in unsupervised anomaly detection, developing methods
    to reduce false alarms and enhance detection accuracy in industrial applications.


    My research extends to optimizing deep learning architectures for resource-constrained
    environments, where I have pioneered techniques in network pruning and compression.
    For instance, I introduced a novel block pruning strategy that directly assesses
    the impact of block removal on classification accuracy, achieving significant
    reductions in model size while maintaining high performance.


    Additionally, I have contributed to advancements in self-supervised learning for
    video representation, proposing the Cascade Positive Retrieval (CPR) method, which
    enhances positive example mining for contrastive learning. My work has consistently
    aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of deep learning models across
    various tasks, from image classification to video action recognition.

    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nRecent advancements in\
    \ vision-language foundation models (VLMs)\n[17,21,29] have marked significant\
    \ progress across various com-\nputer vision tasks. These models exhibit strong\
    \ zero-shot capa-\nbilities, having been pretrained on large-scale image-text\
    \ pairing\ndatasets, one prominent example of them is CLIP. When applying\nVLMs\
    \ to downstream tasks, if the data distribution of the down-\nstream dataset differs\
    \ significantly from the image distribution used\nduring VLMs\u2019 pre-training,\
    \ its zero-shot performance substantially\ndecreases [10].\n\u2217Both authors\

    method CapS-Adapter .CapS-Adapter demonstrates superior\nperformance on 19 datasets.\n\
    Therefore, some studies aiming at adapting VLMs for diverse\ndownstream tasks\
    \ have been introduced in previous works. These methods showed a\ndeclining trend,\
    \ the decrease in Caps-Adapter was more gradual,\nprimarily due to the images\
    \ in the caps being closer to the target\ndistribution.\nFTRAING-FREE FEW SHOT\
    \ CLASSIFICATION\nWITH M-ADAPTER\nWe adapt M-Adapter method to the training-free\
    \ few-shot adap-\ntation regime and compared it with the current state-of-the-art\n\
    (SOTA) model, TIP-X. We conducted this experiment using 1, 2, 4,\n8, 16 shots.\
    \ The RELATED WORK\n2.1 Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nVisual language models\
    \ demonstrate strong performance across\na range of visual tasks and possess powerful\
    \ generalization ca-\npabilities, such as CLIP[ 29], a model trained on a vast\
    \ dataset of\ntext-image pairs through contrastive learning. This approach has\n\
    since inspired a plethora of visual language models that employ sim-\nilar training\
    \ methodologies. The pre-trained CLIP model acquires\nthe ability to represent\
    \ images and text in a shared feature space\nthrough contrastive learning. These\
    \ image-text representations de-\nrived from CLIP can be utilized for downstream\
    \ tasks like semantic\nsegmentation and object detection. Notably, CLIP demonstrates\n\
    the capability to handle zero-shot classification in these tasks by\nemploying\
    \ class prompts in the form of \"A photo of <CLASS>.\"\n2.2 VLMs\u2019 Adaptation\n\
    Inspired by the zero-shot ability of CLIP, subsequent work aims to\nimprove its\
    \ performance. The ability of CLIP to handle zero-shot\nclassification in downstream\
    \ tasks is influenced by the data distri-\nbution of those tasks. Many researchers\
    \ have proposed Methods. Some experiments in using five CLIP[ 29] backbone\nnetworks\
    \ as encoders: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16,\nand ViT-L/14 [ 9].\
