  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing our understanding of complex
    and nonlinear dynamical systems through innovative machine-learning techniques.
    My work primarily focuses on developing model-free, data-driven frameworks that
    enable accurate tracking of time-varying parameters from partial state observations.
    I have explored the potential of reservoir computing and random forests to enhance
    parameter tracking and weak signal detection, particularly in challenging environments
    like magnetic navigation.


    One of my significant contributions is a general model-discovery framework that
    overcomes the limitations of sparse optimization, allowing for the analysis of
    dynamical systems that do not adhere to sparsity conditions. This framework has
    revealed the non-uniqueness of models that can accurately represent system dynamics,
    which has profound implications for understanding chaotic systems.


    In the realm of control engineering, I have developed a machine-learning framework
    for nonlinear tracking control of robotic manipulators, demonstrating its effectiveness
    in real-time applications with partially observed states. My recent research also
    addresses critical environmental issues, such as predicting tipping points in
    the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, where I apply machine-learning
    methods to forecast potential system collapses due to climate change.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical dynamical systems
    and practical applications, contributing to fields ranging from robotics to climate
    science. My research not only enhances our predictive capabilities but also provides
    valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the study of synchronization phenomena
    in complex networks, particularly focusing on group and cluster synchronization.
    My work explores the stability of these synchronization patterns under various
    conditions, including parameter mismatches and the presence of different coupling
    types. I have developed innovative methods, such as simultaneous block diagonalization,
    to simplify the stability analysis of complex systems, allowing for a more nuanced
    understanding of how different network structures influence synchronization behavior.


    My recent research has expanded into the realm of ecological systems, where I
    investigate rate-induced tipping points and their implications for environmental
    stability. By employing a global dynamics approach, I have introduced a probability
    framework for understanding how gradual changes can lead to catastrophic outcomes,
    emphasizing the importance of considering the entire phase space.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the field of data-driven model discovery,
    challenging traditional sparse optimization methods by demonstrating that complex
    dynamical systems can be effectively modeled even when they do not adhere to sparsity
    conditions. My work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    including predicting tipping points in systems like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
    Circulation and exploring transitions between chimera and coherent states in coupled
    oscillators.


    Through my research, I strive to uncover the intricate relationships between network
    dynamics and stability, providing valuable insights that can inform both theoretical
    advancements and real-world applications.'

    metrics, such as the Forecastability Quality Metric (FQM), to assess the predictability
    of chaotic systems, and I have explored the dynamics of Moving Neighborhood Networks
    to analyze emergent behaviors in swarms.


    My research also delves into the intricacies of synchronization in coupled oscillators,
    where I have derived master stability functions that account for parameter mismatches
    across various network architectures. I bridge local geometric analysis with global
    operator-theoretic approaches, particularly through the lens of Koopman analysis,
    to uncover the relationships between dynamical behaviors and their underlying
    structures.


    In addition, I have tackled the challenges of inferring causality in nonlinear
    time series, proposing measures like causation entropy to enhance the reliability

    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet

    solutions and insights that can be applied across a wide range of domains, from
    social networks to biological systems. I am passionate about fostering a deeper
    understanding of how these models can be designed and utilized effectively, paving

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nIn nonlinear dynamics,\
    \ the traditional solution to the inverse problem, i.e., to analyze\ntime series\
    \ to probe into the inner \\gears\" of the system, is based on the paradigm of\
    \ delay-\ncoordinate embedding [1, 2]. The research started about four decades\
    \ ago when Takens [1]\nproved that the underlying dynamical system can be faithfully\
    \ reconstructed from time series\nwith a one-to-one correspondence between the\
    \ reconstructed and the true but unknown\ndynamical systems. From the reconstructed\
    \ system, statistical quantities characterizing the\ndynamical invariant set of\
    \ the original system can be assessed [3, 4]. For example, from\ntime series,\
    \ the fractal dimensions of the underlying chaotic attractor can be estimated\
    \ [5{\n12], as well as the Lyapunov exponents [13{19] and some unstable periodic\
    \ orbits [20{25].\nThe continuity and di\verentiability of the original dynamical\
    \ system can be tested [26{30].\nPractical issues on determining the basic parameters\
    \ of delay-coordinate embedding such\nas the proper time delay [11, 12, 31{36]\
    \ and the embedding dimension [37] were addressed.\nThe Takens' paradigm was also\
    \ extended to dynamical systems in the regime of transient\nchaos [38{43] and\
    \ to systems with a time delay [44].\nThere were previous DISCUSSION\nThe principle\
    \ of exploiting sparse optimization such as compressive sensing to \fnd the\n\
    equations of nonlinear dynamical systems from data was \frst articulated [78]\
    \ in 2011. The\nbasic idea is to expand the equations (the velocity \feld for\
    \ a continuous time dynamical sys-\ntem or the map function for a discrete time\
    \ system) of the underlying system into a power\nseries or a Fourier series of\
    \ a \fnite number of terms and then to determine the vector of the\nexpansion\
    \ coe\x0Ecients based on data through sparse optimization. The sparse optimization\n\
    principle has been demonstrated to be e\vective for \fnding the governing equations\
    \ of cer-\ntain types of nonlinear dynamical systems for inferring the detailed\
    \ connection structures of\ncomplex dynamical networks such as oscillator networks\
    \ and social networks hosting evolu-\ntionary game dynamics. In spite of the demonstrated\
    \ success, limitation and open questions\nremain.\nA key requirement is that the\
    \ coe\x0Ecient vector to be determined must be sparse. If the\nvector \feld or\
    \ the map function contains a few power series terms, such as the classical\n\
    Lorenz [90] or R\x7F ossler [91] chaotic oscillator, or contains a few Fourier\
    \ series terms, such as\nthe standard map [129, 130], then sparse optimization\
    \ can be quite e\vective and computa-\ntionally e\x0Ecient for \fnding the system\
    \ equations [78]. However, if the vector \feld or the\nmap function contains a\
    \ large number of terms in its power series or Fourier series expan-\nsion so\
    \ that the coe\x0Ecient vector to be determined is dense, then the sparse optimization\n\
    methodology will fail. One such example is the classical Ikeda map [131, 132]\
    \ that describes\nthe propagation of a laser pulse in an optical cavity:\nF(x;y)\
    \ =\x12\na+b(xcos\x1E\0ysin\x1E\nb(xsin\x1E+ycos\x1E\x13\n; (33)\nwith the nonlinear\
    \ phase variable \x1Egiven by\n\x1E\x11p\0k\n1 +x2+y2; (34)\nwherea,b,k, andpare\
    \ parameters. It can be seen that both components of the map function\ncontain\
    \ an in\fnite number of power series terms, rendering inapplicable sparse optimization\n\
    for \fnding the system equations from data.\n15In the mathematical formulation\
    \ of compressive sensing Eq. (1), a requirement is that the\nprojection matrix\
    \ Gbe random, e.g., Gaussian type of random matrices with no correlations\namong\
    \ the matrix elements [72, 73, 75{77]. However, in the power series formulation,\
    \ e.g.,\nEq.\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
