  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed
    Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes
    within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction
    and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, thereby enhancing their scalability
    and effectiveness.


    In addition to architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space
    of GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 configurations to provide guidelines
    for optimal model design. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON and AutoTransfer,
    aims to streamline the search for effective neural architectures by leveraging
    prior knowledge and improving efficiency.


    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for understanding and optimizing GNNs,
    with the goal of making them more accessible and effective for a wide range of
    applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to the field of image generation, particularly
    in the realm of anime and high-resolution models. My recent work includes the
    development of the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), a novel image generative
    model that leverages the strengths of the Transformer architecture to achieve
    linear scaling with pixel count. This innovation allows for efficient training
    at high resolutions, such as 1024x1024 pixels, without relying on traditional
    high-resolution techniques like multiscale architectures or latent autoencoders.


    In my technical report, I detail the modifications made to the SDXL framework
    during the training of NovelAI Diffusion V3, which has emerged as a state-of-the-art
    model in anime image generation. My research not only demonstrates that HDiT competes
    effectively with existing models on benchmarks like ImageNet but also sets a new
    standard for diffusion models on FFHQ at 1024x1024 resolution. I am passionate
    about pushing the boundaries of generative models and exploring their potential
    in creating high-quality, visually stunning images.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nDiffusion models have\
    \ recently demonstrated unpar-\nalleled performance across broad applications,\
    \ including\ntext-to-image generation [8, 10, 17\u201319, 37, 42], image edit-\n\
    ing [4, 5, 15, 24, 28, 30, 48], consistent image sequence gen-\neration [27, 29,\
    \ 31], and even achieves promising methods struggle to do so.\n19A cute dogroomchefA\

    \ this section, we start by outlining our experimental\nsettings in Sec. 5.1.\
    \ Subsequently, we present compar-\nisons to existing models with quantitative\
    \ metrics and hu-\nman evaluation in Sec. 5.2. We then showcase qualitative Results\n\
    C.1. Evidence Behind the Core idea & intuition\nAs stated in eDiff-I [1], diffusion\
    \ models synthesize se-\nmantics during early denoising stages and refine image\
    \ de-\ntails in later stages. As depicted in Figure 6, we also observe\nthat semantic\
    \ deviations and object repetitions commonly\nencountered at higher resolutions\
    \ primarily stem from in-\ncorrect semantics generated during early denoising,\
    \ leading\nto irreparable errors. Thus, our intuition and insight hereare: perform\
    \ early denoising at the original resolution to\ngenerate accurate semantic information,\
    \ followed by trun-\ncate andrelay to continue denoising at higher resolutions,\n\
    thereby enriching texture details. This enables MegaFu-\nsion to produce high-quality,\
    \ semantically accurate higher-\nresolution images with lower computational costs,\
    \ while\nsupporting arbitrary aspect ratios.\nC.2. Disadvantages of Direct Upsampling\n\
    Compared to our MegaFusion for higher-resolution im-\nage generation, a more straightforward\
    \ approach is to di-\nrectly apply upsampling to images generated by diffusion\n\
    models. Although simple, this will introduce three poten-\ntial issues: (i) Direct\
    \ super-resolution may lead to unrealis-\ntic texture details, such as blurring\
    \ and artifacts, especially\nat high upsampling factors; (ii) While diffusion-based\

    \ comparison Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce MegaFusion , a tuning-free\n\
    approach designed to tackle the challenges of synthesiz-\ning higher-resolution\
    \ images, effectively resolving issues of\nsemantic inaccuracies and object replication.\
    \ Our method\nadopts an innovative truncate and relay strategy to elegantly\n\
    connect generation processes across different resolutions,\nsynthesizing higher-resolution\
    \ images with megapixels and\nvarious aspect ratios in a coarse-to-fine manner.\
    \ By or-\nthogonally incorporating dilated convolutions andnoise re-\nscheduling\
    \ , we further adapt model priors towards higher\n8resolution. The versatility\
    \ and efficacy of MegaFusion en-\nable it universally applicable to both latent-space\
    \ and pixel-\nspace diffusion models, as well as their extensions with ex-\ntra\
    \ conditions. Extensive References\n[1] Yogesh Balaji, Seungjun Nah, Xun Huang,\
