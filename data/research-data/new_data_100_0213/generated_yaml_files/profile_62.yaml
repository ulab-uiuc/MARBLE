  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nFederated Learning (FL)\
    \ has been a center of interest for\nthe research and industrial communities due\
    \ to its unique\nproperty of collaboratively learning feature representations\n\
    from large-scale datasets without compromising the users\u2019\ndata privacy [28,\
    \ 49, 20, 16]. It has been successful in joint\nvisual representations learning\
    \ from image data while pre-\nserving data privacy [28, 35, 22]. However, current\
    \ prac-\ntices in FL are commonly limited to supervised learning\ntasks that require\
    \ high-quality and domain-speci\uFB01c labels to\nbe available alongside the data.\
    \ This requirement limits the\ndeployment of FL in many real-world applications\
    \ where\naccess to high-quality labels at the edge is restricted [15].\nSelf-Supervised\
    \ Learning (SSL) has been combined with\n*Equal contribution, authors ordered\
    \ alphabetically.FL, enabling it to expand its potential of learning feature\n\
    representations from the vast amount of unlabeled, pri-\nvate, uncurated, and\
    \ visual data being produced at the edge\n[50, 26, 21, 51]. In contrast to supervised\
    \ FL [7, 10, 28],\nfederated self-supervised learning (F-SSL) does not require\n\
    high-quality labeled data, although it may require another\nstage of centralized\
    \ \uFB01ne-tuning or personalizing the model\nfor downstream tasks with limited\
    \ labeled data. F-SSL\nenables the re-purposing of heterogeneous, unlabeled, and\n\
    uncurated real-world image data for various downstream\ntasks. ( viz., image recognition\
    \ [18], object detection[14],\nsemantic segmentation[33], facial recognition,\
    \ authentica-\ntion [15, 38], etc.) by collaboratively learning intermediate\n\
    visual representations in a privacy-preserving fashion.\nOne of the unique challenges\
    \ of F-SSL is learning visual\nrepresentations from non-independently and identically\
    \ dis-\ntributed ( Non-iid ) data [50, 26, 36]. Recent studies in\nF-SSL, both\
    \ image-based [50] and video-based [36], di-\nrectly extend the state-of-the-art\
    \ (SOTA) centralized SSL\npre-training techniques (e.g., SimCLR [5], SimSiam [6],\n\
    BYOL [12], Barlow Twins [45] Speed [1], VCOP [43], and\nCtP [40]) under the setting\
    \ of FL. Generally, these F-SSL results on the \v= 0:2setting are better\nthan\
    \ others. This indicates that the Non-iid level for image-\nSSL may be partially\
    \ determined by actual class labels.\n5.4.2 Cross-device performance\nCompared\
    \ to cross-silo ,cross-device setting is more chal-\nlenging due to its nature\
    \ of heterogeneous data distribu-\ntion. One can observe from Table 6 that our\
    \ proposed meth-\nods still perform better than all baselines with a slight im-\n\
    provement of 1:26%/0:25% (SimCLR) and 0:25%/0:85%\n(Barlow Twins) on CIFAR-10/100,\
    \ respectively. Also, the\ncombination of L-DAWA with the existing experiments\
    \ show that L-DAWA obtained a new SOTA per-\nformance in the cross-silo andcross-device\
    \ settings with\nboth contrastive and non-contrastive SSL Methods !CIFAR-10!CIFAR-100\n\
