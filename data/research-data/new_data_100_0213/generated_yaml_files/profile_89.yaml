    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nWhile today\u2019s general-purpose\
    \ robots are rapidly advanc-\ning towards achieving dexterous capabilities comparable\
    \ to\nhuman workers [1], [2], [3], they still face several signifi-\ncant limitations.\
    \ They lack cognitive abilities to assess the\nsemantics of situations, states,\
    \ and actions of both themselves\nand others, or engage in meaning-oriented, human-level\n\
    dialog. They also struggle to deal with disturbances and\nnovel situations, which\
    \ limits their adaptability in dynamic\nenvironments. Finally, they fall short\
    \ of being trusted because\nthey are unable to generate causal explanations of\
    \ their\nreasoning and action.\nTo serve as trusted partners, robots must be able\
    \ to:\nreliably collaborate on complex and novel tasks and mis-\nsions; interpret\
    \ and anticipate teammates\u2019 actions and needs;\ncommunicate with teammates\
    \ in natural language; learn\nnew skills on the job from language and demonstration;\n\
    explain their own and others\u2019 decisions and actions; and\nteach teammates\
    \ through language and demonstration.\nThe HARMONIC framework we present aims\
    \ to meet\nthese challenges by facilitating the implementation of em-\nbodied\
    \ robots that can remember, plan, reason, explain, ne-\ngotiate, learn, and teach.\
    \ Specifically, the architecture enables\nrobots to perform:\n1) physical actions,\
    \ such as repairing, cleaning and gofer-\ning;\n2) the mental actions needed to\
    \ emulate human-like be-\nhavior, such as meaning-oriented language processing;\n\
    reasoning about plans, goals, and attitudes; explaining\nthe reasons for their\
    \ own and others\u2019 actions; and\naccessing and archiving institutional memory\
    \ (which\nis key to operating in complex environments); and\n3) hybrid actions,\
    \ such as teaching and learning physical\nand mental actions through natural language\
    \ and visual\ndemonstration.\n1Authors are with the Cognitive Science Department\

    Fig. 1. An overview of the HARMONIC framework showing the strategic\nand tactical\
    \ layers.\nThe HARMONIC framework (Figure 1) is an extension\nof hybrid control\
    \ systems and architectures as summarized\nby Dennis et al. [4] and is an enhancement\
    \ over the type\n2 integration in the DIARC framework [5], [6], in which\nconcurrent\
    \ and dynamic operation is facilitated by incorpo-\nrating the strategic layer\
    \ as a subsystem within the tactical\nlayer. In HARMONIC, by contrast, the strategic\
    \ and tactical\nlayer components function independently and interactively.\nMoreover,\
    \ while we implemented HARMONIC using spe-\ncific cognitive and robotic control\
    \ systems, this framework\nwas designed to facilitate implementation using any\
    \ state-\nof-the-art cognitive and robotic system that supports all the\nrequired\
    \ functionalities.\nWhile basic strategic layer functionality can be imple-\n\
    mented using generalist models [7], including Large Lan-\nguage Models (LLMs)\
    \ and Vision-Language-Action (VLA)\nmodels [8], these cannot support human-level\
    \ explainability,\nwhich is crucial for establishing trust with humans [9].\n\
    To ensure explainability, VLAs and LLMs are limited to\nspecific modules and functionalities\
    \ within the HARMONIC\nframework. For details of such integration, see [10] and\
    \ [11].\nII. T HEFRAMEWORK\nHARMONIC is a dual control architecture consisting\
    \ of\na strategic (cognitive) layer for high-level decision-making\nand planning,\
    \ a tactical (robot) layer for low-level robot\ncontrol and execution, and a bidirectional\
    \ interface to support\ncommunication between the layers, as shown in Figure 1.\n\
    The strategic layer includes modules for attention man-\nagement, perception interpretation,\
    \ and utility-based and ana-\nlogical decision-making, enhanced by metacognitive\
    \ abilities\nsupported by the microtheories of the OntoAgent cognitive\narchitecture\
    \ [12], [13]. These modules prioritize the strategic\ngoal and plan agenda, and\
