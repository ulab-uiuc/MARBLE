  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of machine learning
    and artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of polymer property prediction,
    urban planning, feature transformation, and biomarker discovery. My recent work
    focuses on developing innovative frameworks that address the limitations of existing
    methodologies. For instance, I introduced the Traceable Group-wise Reinforcement
    Generation Perspective to enhance polymer property predictions by automating descriptor
    generation and selection, ensuring both optimality and explainability.


    In urban planning, I proposed the Dual-stage Urban Flows (DSUF) framework, which
    leverages normalizing flows to generate functional zones and land-use configurations
    while capturing the intricate relationships among different urban zones. This
    approach not only improves the stability and interpretability of the planning
    process but also streamlines the design of urban environments.


    My research also tackles the challenge of unsupervised feature transformation
    learning (UFTL) by integrating graph, contrastive, and generative learning techniques.
    This paradigm allows for the effective capture of complex feature interactions
    without relying on expensive supervised feedback.


    Additionally, I am passionate about biomarker discovery, where I developed a framework
    that automates the identification of effective biomarker subsets through a multi-agent
    system and an encoder-evaluator-decoder learning paradigm. This work aims to reduce
    the reliance on extensive human effort while enhancing the efficiency and robustness
    of biomarker identification.


    Through my research, I strive to create impactful solutions that bridge the gap
    between complex scientific challenges and practical applications, ultimately contributing
    to advancements in personalized medicine and sustainable urban development.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nClassic machine learning\
    \ on tabular data is highly dependent on the structure of the model, the\nactivation\
    \ function [ 1], and most importantly, the quality of the training data [ 2,3]\
    \ (as depicted in\nFigure 1(a)). Traditionally, optimizing tabular data has required\
    \ extensive manual intervention by\ndomain experts [4, 5], which is time-consuming\
    \ and labor-intensive. Current research is focused on\nautomatically transforming\
    \ the original feature spaces through a series of mathematical operations [ 6],\n\
    thereby minimizing the reliance on human expertise and streamlining the data preparation\
    \ phase.\n\u2217Corresponding Author\nPreprint. Under review.arXiv:2406.07404v1\
    \  [cs.LG]  11 Jun 2024The mainstream of existing automated feature transformation\
    \ adopts an iterative perspective: 1)\nexpansion-reduction approaches [7\u2013\
    9] randomly combine and generate features through mathemati-\ncal transformations,\
    \ then employ feature selection techniques to isolate high-quality features. Those\n\
    approaches are highly stochastic, lacked stability, and could not learn strategy\
    \ from transformation\nsteps. 2) iterative-feedback approaches [10,11] aim at\
    \ refining the feature space with the trans-\nformation towards reinforcement\
    \ learning [ 12\u201314] and evolutionary algorithms [ 15]. Although\nthose results\
    \ in terms of\n1-RAE for the Housing Boston dataset and F1-score for the Messidor_features\
    \ dataset, respectively.\nWe can observe that the transformed features generated\
    \ by our model consistently achieved the\nhighest performance in regression and\
    \ classification tasks among each downstream machine learning\nmethod. Therefore,\
    \ this experiment validates the effectiveness of our model in generating informative\n\
    and robust features for various downstream models.\nA.1.4 Case Study on Generated\

    \ Table 4 presents the Top-10 most important features\ngenerated by the original\
    \ dataset, our proposed method, and its feature-centric variants (i.e., TCTO\u2212\
    g).\nWe can first observe that TCTO has reused many high-value sub-transformations,\
    \ such as node v17\nin Housing Boston and node v30in Wine Quality White. Compared\
    \ to TCTO\u2212g, the graph-based\nmodel tends to reuse important intermediate\
    \ nodes, transforming them to generate more significant\nfeatures. A possible\
    \ reason for this is that our model effectively utilizes historical information\
    \ from\nthe graph, identifying optimal substructures and exploring and transforming\
    \ these crucial nodes,\nthereby utilizing the historical sub-transformations.\
    \ Another point to note is that the transformed\nfeature\u2019s importance score\
    \ in our model tends to be more balanced compared to the original dataset\nand\
    \ its variant, e.g., the sum of the top-10 feature importance is lower.\n\n  \
