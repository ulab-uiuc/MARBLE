  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis\
    \ suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system\
    \ of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit\
    \ from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language\
    \ data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations,\
    \ like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language\
    \ of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired\
    \ representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the\
    \ Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical,\
    \ composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties,\
    \ and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns\
    \ to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying\
    \ data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating\
    \ superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization,\
    \ and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous\
    \ object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards\
    \ creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing\
    \ LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive\
    \ science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis\
    \ (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured,\
    \ language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201C\
    Mentalese\u201D.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like\
    \ structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201Csentences\u201D\
    \ is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201Cwords\u201D\
    \ and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural\
    \ language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al.,\
    \ 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently\
    \ expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how\
    \ we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\n\
    such as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is\
    \ further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing\
    \ objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow\
    \ can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought\
    \ representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following\
    \ three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought\
    \ model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent\
    \ it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally\
    \ and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components\
    \ such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n\
    (Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is\
    \ that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words,\
    \ objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly\
    \ those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have\
    \ demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated\
    \ with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023;\
    \ Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al.,\
    \ 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217\
