    and its applications in complex systems, particularly in motion control and recommendation
    systems. My recent work has focused on developing innovative algorithms that enhance
    sample efficiency while addressing model bias. One of my key contributions is
    the Model-Embedding Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MEMB) algorithm, which

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of event sequence
    modeling, user representation learning, and temporal data analysis. My recent
    work has focused on developing innovative frameworks and models that address complex
    challenges in these areas. For instance, I introduced HYPRO, a hybrid probabilistic

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing wireless network capacity through
    innovative antenna design. My recent work focuses on the development of a six-dimensional
    movable antenna (6DMA) system, which allows for both 3D positioning and 3D rotation
    of antennas. This flexibility is crucial for maximizing network performance, yet
    I recognize the practical challenges posed by existing base station architectures
    that typically rely on fixed-position antenna arrays.


    To address this, I introduced a hybrid fixed and movable antenna (HFMA) architecture
    that integrates conventional fixed-position arrays with adjustable 6DMA surfaces.
    This design not only facilitates implementation but also optimizes network capacity
    by adapting the rotation angles of the 6DMA surfaces based on user distribution.
    Given the combinatorial nature of this optimization problem, I developed an adaptive
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to efficiently find solutions without the computational
    burden of exhaustive search.


    Through simulations, I have demonstrated significant performance improvements
    with my proposed HFMA design compared to traditional benchmarks. My research aims
    to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications
    in wireless communication, ultimately contributing to more efficient and flexible
    network infrastructures.'
