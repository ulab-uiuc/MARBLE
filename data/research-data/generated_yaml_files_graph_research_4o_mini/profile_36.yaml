  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nA critical concern with\
    \ deep learning models arises from\ntheir well-known tendency to base their predictions\
    \ on cor-\nrelations present in the training data rather than robustly\ninformative\
    \ features (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Sagawa et al.,\n2020). For instance, in image\
    \ classification, translating an\nimage by a few pixels (Azulay & Weiss, 2019)\
    \ or modifying\nthe background spurious correlations. We hypothesize\nthat because\
    \ of this, on CMNIST and CelebA (Table 1),\nwhere concepts are less spatially\
    \ separable, our method\u2019s\nbenefit is a bit limited compared to other datasets\
    \ like Water-\nbirds, Urban Cars, Bar (Nam et al., 2020) (Table 6), whereconcepts\
    \ have clear spatial regions. Further investigation in\nthis direction is needed.\
    \ In principle, one could try to learn a\ndisentangled representation of the high\
    \ level objects and use\nthe disentangled factors of variations as concept. Work\
    \ like\nSingh et al. (2022) that further factorizes the representation\nof each\
    \ semantic region can be used to mitigate this issue by\nallowing one spatial\
    \ region to be represented as a collection\nof concepts.\n4.2.7. A VOIDING REPRESENTATION\
    \ COLLAPSE\nOur concept discovery method is based on self-supervised\nSiamese\
    \ representation learning, utilizing two parallel en-\ncoders: the student produces\
    \ the source slot encoding and\nthe teacher produces the target encoding. One\
    \ of the main\nissues with this kind of encoder-only learning framework is\nrepresentation\
    \ collapse (Hua et al., 2021). During training,\nour method can obtain a degenerate\
    \ solution in which all\nrepresentations of the slots fall into one cluster, while\
    \ still\nminimizing the objective in Equation 5.\nTo avoid this degenerate case,\
    \ we employ a similar set of\nideas as DINO (Caron et al., 2021) to have asymmetric\n\
    teacher and student branches: 1) using data augmentations\nof teacher and student\
    \ views; 2) centering and sharpening\nof teacher slot distributions; 3) updating\
    \ teacher weights by\ntaking an exponential moving average of student. Typically,\n\
    the teacher model\u2019s weights are updated after every gradient\nupdate step\
    \ for most datasets. However, for the CMNIST\ndatasets, data augmentation is not\
    \ used. To maintain the\nasymmetry between the teacher and student models in the\n\
    absence of data augmentation, the updates for the CMNIST\ndatasets are performed\
    \ less frequently, specifically after\nevery 20 steps.\n5. related work in Section\
    \ 2). Our approach models concepts\nthat do not necessarily correspond directly\
    \ to subgroups;\ntypically, we use a significantly larger number of concepts\n\
    than annotated subgroups in the dataset.\nThis paper demonstrates the use of object-centric\
    \ represen-\ntation learning approaches to design classifiers robust to\nspurious\
    \ correlations without the need for human-labeled\nsubgroup annotations. We introduce\
    \ CoBalT, a method\ncombining concept discovery with concept balancing for\nrobust\
    \ classification. CoBalT follows a two-stage procedure\ncommon in the literature:\
    \ first, inferring information about\nthe training data, and then leveraging this\
    \ information for\nrobust training.\nInStage 1 , we propose to vector quantize\
    \ semantic group-\n1arXiv:2402.13368v2  [cs.LG]  16 Jul 2024Unsupervised Concept\
    \ Discovery Mitigates Spurious Correlations\ning representations into discrete\
    \ concepts (Section 3.2), en-\nabling the association of each input with relevant\
    \ sets of\nconcepts (see Fig 1) and facilitating the calculation of con-\ncept\
    \ occurrence statistics across the dataset.\nInStage 2 , we utilize the occurrence\
    \ statistics of concepts\nvia importance sampling to train a separate classifier\
    \ (Sec-\ntion 3.3). The architecture of the classifier is inconsequen-\ntial;\
    \ the key contribution lies in the concept-aware sampling\nprocedure, bridging\
    \ object-centric representation learning\nand learning under subpopulation shifts.\n\
    Integrating Stages 1 and 2 introduces CoBalT (Concept Bal-\nancing Technique)\
