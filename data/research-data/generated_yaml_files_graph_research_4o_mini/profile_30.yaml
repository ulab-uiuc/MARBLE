  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in deep imitation learning and its applications
    in autonomous driving, with a particular focus on navigating complex environments
    like crowded intersections. My recent work has led to the development of a multi-task
    conditional imitation learning framework that enhances both lateral and longitudinal
    control tasks, significantly improving interaction safety with pedestrians. I
    also created the IntersectNav benchmark, which provides human demonstrations to
    facilitate research in this area.


    In addition to my work on imitation learning, I have conducted a comprehensive
    survey of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep imitation learning (DIL)

    Moreover, I have explored the realm of remote sensing image processing, specifically
    focusing on pansharpening. I developed a novel probability-based global cross-modal
    upsampling method (PGCU) that leverages both local and global information from
    low-resolution multispectral images and guiding panchromatic images. My experiments
    demonstrate that PGCU outperforms existing methods and enhances the performance
    of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in pansharpening.

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nGraph neural networks\
    \ (GNNs) are a class of neural networks\nthat operate on graph-structured data.\
    \ GNNs have shown to be\neffective in addressing a variety of real-world applications\
    \ such as\nfraud detection [ 18,47,74], recommendation systems [ 61,71,72],\n\
    predicting molecular and protein structure [ 29,57], knowledge\n1Accepted in KDD\u2019\
    23. DOI: 10.1145/3580305.3599843representation [ 15], and more recently helping\
    \ in fine-tuning large\nlanguage models [ 73]. Their popularity has led to the\
    \ development\nof various optimized frameworks and libraries [ 19,63,76] that\n\
    enable the fast application of GNNs on new domains, making it\neasier for researchers\
    \ and practitioners to leverage the power of\nGNNs in their work.\nHowever, high-quality\
    \ frameworks and libraries are necessary\nbut not sufficient for enabling fast\
    \ research progress in GNN. One\nof the major challenges in GNN research is the\
    \ lack of large-scale\ndatasets. This is because large graph datasets are typically\
    \ propriety\nand most publicly available ones are rather small. The small size\n\
    of these datasets makes it difficult to train GNNs that can handle\nlarge-graph\
    \ structures and prevents the use of powerful pre-training\ntechniques [ 16,32,59,65].\
    \ These challenges make it difficult to fully\nleverage GNN potential and its\
    \ applications.\nTo address these challenges, recent work such as OGBN and\nMAG\
    \ [ 26,27] have proposed open large graph benchmark suites\nproviding up to 244\
    \ million nodes and 1.7 billion edge graphs. These\ndatasets contain a diverse\
    \ set of graphs and have been widely used\nin the research community to benchmark\
    \ GNNs\u2019 performance. How-\never, most existing datasets, including OGBN,\
    \ provide very limited\nlabeled data. As GNN downstream tasks are often trained\
    \ as super-\nvised learning tasks, having large labeled data matters, especially\n\
    for multi-label classification problems. However, both OGBN and\nMAG use Arxiv\
    \ [ 26,27] class labels which provide 1.4 million la-\nbeled nodes, meaning only\
    \ about 1% of the overall dataset is labeled!\nWith such small labeled data usage\
    \ during training, it becomes chal-\nlenging to determine if the GNN model\u2019\
    s low accuracy for unseen\ndata is inherently due to insufficient training data\
    \ or if the model\nitself fails to generalize [28, 37, 45, 62, 78].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the lack of flexible datasets hinders the researcher\u2019s\nability to scrutinize\
    \ and systematically evaluate the scalability of\nthe GNN models, frameworks,\
    \ and systems. Ideally, a dataset should\nprovide (a) capability to study the\
    \ impact of embedding generation\ntechniques and their properties on the GNN model\u2019\
    s accuracy, (b)\nprovide sub-datasets of varying graph sizes and embeddings main-\n\
    taining consistent homophily, and (c) provide a range of multi-class\nclassification\
    \ tasks with varying degrees of complexity. Without\nsuch flexible datasets, it\
    \ is difficult to train models on small graph\ndatasets and then evaluate their\
    \ accuracy and execution efficiency\non larger data corpus, a common scenario\
    \ in industrial settings.\nMoreover, the framework and system scalability problems\
    \ encoun-\ntered with small datasets are different from those with large datasets,\n\
    making it challenging to study the system requirements of GNNs.arXiv:2302.13522v2\
