  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nState-of-the-art\
    \ LLMs such as GPT-4\_(Achiam et\_al. 2023), Gemini\_(Team et\_al. 2023), Llama-3\_\
    (Meta 2024), and Claude-3 Sonnet\_(Anthropic 2024) achieve remarkable performance\
    \ through pre-training on large amounts of internet texts and rigorous alignment\
    \ process for safety enhancement.\nDespite the immense effort in safety research,\
    \ LLMs are still vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks and can exhibit unwanted\
    \ behaviors\_(Shah et\_al. 2023; Chao et\_al. 2023; Zou et\_al. 2023b; Jones et\_\
    al. 2023; Yuan et\_al. 2024; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2024).\n\n\nMachine\
    \ Unlearning\_(Cao and Yang 2015; Chris Jay\_Hoofnagle and Borgesius 2019; Bourtoule\
    \ et\_al. 2021; Nguyen et\_al. 2022; Xu et\_al. 2023; Liu et\_al. 2024c) has emerged\
    \ as a promising method for mitigating unforeseen risks in LLMs before deployment.\n\
    Li et\_al. (2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)\u2014\
    an unlearning method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples\
    \ that the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the\
    \ representations of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember)\
    \ unchanged.\nRMU significantly degrades models\u2019 accuracy on forget-tasks,\
    \ while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates\
    \ stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason\
    \ for RMU\u2019s effectiveness is not well understood, hindering the development\
    \ of better unlearning algorithms. In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\
    \n\n\u2022\n\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\
    \n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe investigate the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness.\
    \ We demonstrate that RMU impedes the adversary\u2019s ability to determine optimal\
    \ updates for generating adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness\
    \ of the model.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss,\
    \ which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between forget representation and\
    \ a fixed scaled random vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget\
    \ representation is larger than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective\
    \ when applied to middle and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nTo overcome\
    \ RMU\u2019s limitation, we introduce Adaptive RMU\u2014a variant that adaptively\
    \ adjusts the coefficient value based on the norm of the forget representation.\
    \ Experimental results show that Adaptive RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy\
    \ for forget knowledge, maintaining high performance on general knowledge, and\
    \ enables effective unlearning for most layers without incurring additional computational\
    \ overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\
    \nA natural is leave-some-out retraining: retraining the model from scratch without\
    \ the forget samples. However, this method becomes more computationally expensive\
    \ as the size of datasets and modern deep networks grows. Existing works focus\
    \ on approximating unlearning\_(Warnecke et\_al. 2021; Izzo et\_al. 2021; Sekhari\
    \ et\_al. 2021; Isonuma and Titov 2024) using Influence Function\_(Koh and Liang\
    \ 2017; Grosse et\_al. 2023), gradient projection\_(Bae et\_al. 2023), gradient\
    \ ascent\_(Thudi et\_al. 2022; Trippa et\_al. 2024), second-order approximation\_\
    (Jia et\_al. 2024), preference optimization\_(Zhang et\_al. 2024b), and embedding\
    \ corrupted\_(Liu et\_al. 2024a). Other views on the landscape of machine unlearning\
    \ include: unlearning in text classification\_(Ma et\_al. 2022), image classification\
    \ and recognition\_(Ginart et\_al. 2019; Golatkar, Achille, and Soatto 2020; Fan\
    \ et\_al. 2024; Choi and Na 2023; Cha et\_al. 2024), image-to-image generative\
