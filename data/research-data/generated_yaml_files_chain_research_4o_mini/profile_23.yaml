    equations and uncertainty quantification. My work primarily focuses on developing
    efficient algorithms for approximating solutions to complex problems, particularly
    in the context of financial mathematics and partial differential equations (PDEs)
    with random data.


    In my recent publications, I have introduced innovative techniques such as the
    Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation method (MISC) and the Continuation Multi-Level

    methods for high-dimensional imaging problems. My work primarily focuses on developing
    innovative algorithms that enhance the efficiency and accuracy of Bayesian estimation
    techniques, particularly in the context of inverse problems that are often ill-posed
    and exhibit significant uncertainty.


    In my recent publications, I have introduced a novel Metropolis-adjusted Langevin
    algorithm (MALA) that leverages convex analysis to efficiently sample from high-dimensional
    log-concave densities. This method not only improves convergence properties but
    also extends the applicability of MALA to non-differentiable target densities,
    which are increasingly relevant in modern machine learning and image processing.


    I have also made significant strides in uncertainty quantification, proposing
    methodologies that allow for robust analysis of uncertainty in reconstructed images.
    My work on Bayesian hypothesis testing and the development of efficient Markov
    chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods has provided new insights into the reliability
    of imaging results, particularly in radio interferometric imaging, where I have
    demonstrated the ability to quantify uncertainties in a computationally feasible
    manner.


    Additionally, I have explored the intersection of generative models and Bayesian
    inference, presenting a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that reduces computational
    costs while maintaining accuracy in large-scale inverse problems. My research
    aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications,
    ensuring that the methodologies I develop can be effectively utilized in real-world

    by exploring Hamiltonian splitting methods and preconditioning dynamics, which
    has led to the development of more effective sampling strategies compared to traditional
    leapfrog integrators.


    I have also contributed to the field of numerical integration by proposing new
    higher-order integrators that generalize extrapolation methods. These innovations
    not only improve computational efficiency but also address latency issues in parallel
    environments, making them suitable for a variety of applications.


    In addition, I have investigated the stability properties of splitting integrators
    for dynamical systems, demonstrating that Strang splitting offers optimal stability
    compared to alternative methods. This work builds on foundational principles in
    numerical analysis and extends their applicability to complex systems.


    More recently, I have turned my attention to generative diffusion models in Bayesian
    inverse problems. Recognizing the computational challenges posed by these models,
    I developed a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that effectively balances cost and
    accuracy. This approach has shown significant promise in reducing computational
    expenses while maintaining high accuracy in large-scale inverse problems, particularly

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 1: Aurora\
    \ is a 1.3 billion parameter foundation model for high-resolution forecasting\
    \ of weather and atmospheric processes. Aurora is a flexible 3D Swin Transformer\
    \ with 3D Perceiver-based encoders and decoders. At pretraining time, Aurora is\
    \ optimised to minimise a loss \u2112\u2112\\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L on multiple\
    \ heterogeneous datasets with different resolutions, variables, and pressure levels.\
    \ The model is then fine-tuned in two stages: (1) short-lead time fine-tuning\
    \ of the pretrained weights (2) long-lead time (rollout) fine-tuning using Low\
    \ Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The fine-tuned models are then deployed to tackle a\
    \ diverse collection of operational forecasting scenarios at different resolutions.\n\
    \n\nDeep learning foundation models have revolutionised various scientific domains,\
    \ such as protein structure prediction [Abramson et\_al., 2024], drug discovery\
    \ [Chithrananda et\_al., 2020], computer vision [Betker et\_al., 2023], and natural\
    \ language processing [OpenAI, 2024]. The key tenets of foundation models include\
    \ pretraining, where a single large-scale neural network learns to capture intricate\
    \ patterns and structure from a large corpus of diverse data; and fine-tuning,\
    \ which allows the model to leverage its learned representations to excel at new\
    \ tasks with limited training data [Bommasani et\_al., 2021, Brown et\_al., 2020].\n\
    \n\nThe Earth system is a complex and interconnected network of subsystems, such\
    \ as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice, which constantly interact in intricate\
    \ ways.\nIn a rapidly changing climate, accurate understanding of these subsystems\
    \ becomes increasingly important.\nWe envision that foundation models can revolutionise\
    \ our ability to model subsystems of the Earth, and eventually the whole Earth.\n\
    \n\nAmongst the Earth\u2019s subsystems, the atmosphere stands out as particularly\
    \ data-rich [Reichstein et\_al., 2019, Bauer et\_al., 2015] and therefore constitutes\
    \ ripe ground for pretraining a foundation model. Classical atmospheric simulation\
    \ approaches, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), are costly and unable\
    \ to exploit this wealth of data [Bauer et\_al., 2015]. Recent deep learning approaches\
    \ are cheaper, more flexible, and have shown great promise in specific prediction\
    \ tasks with abundant training data [Lam et\_al., 2023, Bi et\_al., 2023, Chen\
    \ et\_al., 2023a, b, Han et\_al., 2024, Kochkov et\_al., 2024, Lessig et\_al.,\
    \ 2023, Pathak et\_al., 2022, Bonev et\_al., 2023, Andrychowicz et\_al., 2023,\
    \ Ham et\_al., 2019, Nguyen et\_al., 2023a, b]. However, these methods struggle\
    \ when atmospheric training data are scarce [Chantry et\_al., 2021] or heterogeneous\
    \ [Reichstein et\_al., 2019], and they lack robustness in predicting extremes\
    \ [Charlton-Perez et\_al., 2024].\nBy learning generalizable representations from\
    \ vast amounts of diverse data, foundation models have been able to overcome analogous\
    \ challenges in other domains\n[Zhai et\_al., 2022, Radford et\_al., 2021, Bommasani\
    \ et\_al., 2021, Nguyen et\_al., 2023a].\n\n\nHere we introduce Aurora: a foundation\
    \ model of the atmosphere. Aurora can produce forecasts for a wide variety of\
    \ atmospheric forecasting problems, including those with limited training data,\
    \ heterogeneous variables, and extreme events. We demonstrate this ability by\
    \ producing operational forecasts for global air pollution and global high-resolution\
    \ medium-term weather patterns that match or outperform state-of-the-art classical\
    \ simulation tools, at orders of magnitude smaller computational cost.\nSpecifically,\
    \ in under a minute, Aurora generates 5-day air pollution forecasts at 0.4\u2218\
    superscript0.40.4^{\\circ}0.4 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2218 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
