    bodies within our Solar System, particularly focusing on transneptunian objects
    (TNOs), asteroids, and their interactions with planetary systems. My recent work
    has delved into the stability of orbits in the Earth-Mars belt, revealing a narrower
    region where small bodies can survive over 4.5 billion years. I have also explored
    the intriguing dynamics of sednoids, uncovering a primordial alignment that suggests
    significant events during the planet formation epoch.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nHumans use all\
    \ facial expressions, body motions, and hand motions to express our emotions and\
    \ intentions, and interact with other people and objects.\nIn particular, facial\
    \ expressions and hand gestures are one of the most powerful channels for non-verbal\
    \ communication, and hand motions are necessary to interact with diverse types\
    \ of objects.\nModeling the facial expression, body motion, and hand motion altogether\
    \ is extremely challenging.\nSeveral whole-body 3D human geometry models have\
    \ been introduced\_[21, 37, 50, 2].\nAmong them, SMPL-X\_[37] is the most widely\
    \ used one, which motivated a number of 3D whole-body pose estimation methods\_\
    [9, 45, 11, 32, 52, 26, 28, 4] and benchmarks\_[36].\n\n\nTo represent 3D humans\
    \ beyond the minimally clothed parametric models, personalized 3D human avatars\
    \ have been recently studied.\nThe 3D human avatar is a representation that combines\
    \ 3D geometry and the appearance of a certain person, which can be animated and\
    \ rendered with novel poses.\nHowever, most of existing 3D human avatars\_[39,\
    \ 38, 25, 8, 6, 20, 15, 19, 24, 18] modeled from a casually captured video only\
    \ support body motions without facial expressions and hand motions.\nTheir avatars\
    \ bake facial expressions and hand poses, and animating them is not possible.\n\
    A recent work\_[47] introduced a whole-body avatar that supports animation with\
    \ facial expressions, and body and hand poses; however, it requires 3D observations,\
    \ such as 3D scans or RGBD images with highly accurate SMPL-X registrations, with\
    \ diverse poses and facial expressions.\nSuch an assumption does not hold for\
    \ the majority of casually captured videos in daily life.\n\n\nFigure 1: \nFrom\
    \ (a) a monocular video from a single person, we create our (b) ExAvatar, an expressive\
    \ whole-body 3D avatar, animatable with novel facial expression code, hand poses,\
    \ and body poses of SMPL-X.\n\n\n\nWe present ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body\
    \ 3D human avatar that can be made from a short monocular video.\nExAvatar is\
    \ designed as a combination of the whole-body 3D parametric model (SMPL-X)\_[37]\
    \ and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\_[22].\nIt utilizes the whole-body drivability\
    \ of SMPL-X and the photorealistic and efficient rendering capability of 3DGS.\n\
    After the training, it is animatable with novel facial expression code and 3D\
    \ pose of SMPL-X, as shown in Fig.\_1.\nDespite its desired properties, modeling\
    \ ExAvatar is an non-trivial task with the following two challenges: 1) a limited\
    \ diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of\
    \ 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD videos.\nThe limited diversity in\
    \ the video makes a drivability with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial.\n\
    In addition, the absence of 3D observations creates ambiguity in the occluded\
    \ human parts, exhibiting noticeable artifacts in novel facial expressions and\
    \ poses.\n\n\nTo address them, we propose a novel hybrid representation of the\
    \ surface mesh and 3D Gaussians in ExAvatar.\nOur hybrid representation treats\
    \ each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface, where the vertices have pre-defined\
    \ connectivity (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology\
    \ of SMPL-X.\nExisting volumetric avatars\_[39, 38, 25, 8, 6, 20, 15, 19, 47]\
    \ do not have the connectivity by the definition.\nAlso, previous 3DGS-based\_\
    [24, 18] works consider a set of 3D Gaussian points as a point cloud without considering\
    \ the connectivity between them.\n\n\nUsing our hybrid representation, our\n\n\
