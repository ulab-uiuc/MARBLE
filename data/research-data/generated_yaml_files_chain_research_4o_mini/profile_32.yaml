  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of machine learning
    and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on probabilistic modeling,
    reinforcement learning, and deep learning applications. My recent work includes
    the development of the Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) model, which effectively
    addresses the challenges of imbalanced regression while providing robust uncertainty
    estimations. I have also pioneered methods for domain adaptation in contextual
    bandits, enabling effective learning across different domains despite distribution
    shifts.


    My research extends to the integration of geometry in neural networks, where I

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the robustness and performance
    of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through innovative approaches to graph structure
    learning. My recent work addresses a critical challenge in GNNs: the amplification
    of noise during the message-passing process, which often arises from relying solely
    on observed adjacency matrices. To tackle this issue, I have developed a novel
    Boolean product-based graph residual connection that effectively links latent
    graphs with their original counterparts. This method not only corrects the learning
    process by computing the Boolean product between adjacency matrices at each layer
    but also facilitates the discovery of triangular cliques within the graph structure.


    My research emphasizes the importance of mitigating fluctuations in latent graph
    learning, and I have validated my approach using benchmark datasets, demonstrating
    significant improvements in both performance and robustness. I am passionate about
    exploring the intricate relationships within graph data and continuously seek
    to push the boundaries of GNN capabilities, contributing to the broader field

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nGraph neural networks\
    \ (GNNs) [8, 12, 23, 33] have recently received considerable attention due to\n\
    their strong ability to handle complex graph-structured data. GNNs consider each\
    \ data sample as a\nnode and model the affinities between nodes as the weights\
    \ of edges. The edges as a whole constitute\nthe graph structure or topology of\
    \ the data. By integrating the graph topology into the training process\nof representation\
    \ learning, GNNs have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of\n\
    tasks, such as classification [19, 37], clustering [31, 40], retrieval [5, 43],\
    \ and recognition [35, 44].\nAlthough effective, existing GNNs typically require\
    \ a prior graph to learn node representations, which\nposes a major challenge\
    \ when encountering incomplete or even missing graphs. This limitation has\nspurred\
    \ the development of latent graph inference (LGI) [7, 10, 17, 22, 32], also known\
    \ as graph\nstructure learning [9, 24, 39, 42]. LGI aims to jointly learn the\
    \ underlying graph and discriminative\nnode representations solely from the features\
    \ of nodes in an end-to-end fashion. By adaptively\nlearning the graph topology,\
    \ LGI models are empowered with great ability to remove noise and\ncapture more\
    \ complex structure of the data [13,26,27,47]. Consequently, LGI emerges as a\
    \ promising\nresearch topic with a broad range of applications, such as point\
    \ cloud segmentation [41], disease\nprediction [6], multi-view clustering [31],\
    \ and brain connectome representation [18].\n\u2217Corresponding author: JianglinLu@outlook.com\

    \ aims to\nsimultaneously learn the underlying graph structure and discriminative\
    \ node representations from the\nfeatures of data [10, 24, 39]. For example, Jiang\
    \ et al. [15] propose to infer the graph structure by\ncombining graph learning\
    \ and graph convolution in a unified framework. Yang et al. [45] model the\ntopology\
    \ refinement as a label propagation process. Jin et al. [16] explore some intrinsic\
    \ properties of\nthe latent graph and propose a robust LGI framework to defend\
    \ adversarial attacks on graphs. Though\neffective, these Conclusion\nIn this\
