  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing data estimation techniques in
    sensor-less environments, particularly in the realms of traffic state estimation
    and environmental monitoring. My recent work centers around the development of
    Kriformer, a novel graph transformer model designed to tackle the challenges posed
    by sparse sensor deployment and unreliable data. By framing the estimation problem
    as a spatiotemporal kriging task, I leverage the power of transformer architecture
    to effectively capture spatial and temporal correlations, even when resources
    are limited.


    In Kriformer, I have integrated a carefully constructed positional encoding module
    that embeds spatiotemporal features, alongside a sophisticated spatiotemporal
    attention mechanism that significantly boosts estimation accuracy. My approach
    includes a multi-head spatial interaction attention module, which adeptly captures
    subtle spatial relationships between observed and unobserved locations. I also
    employ a random masking strategy during training, enabling the model to learn
    from partial information loss and enhancing its ability to discern correlations
    among various locations.


    The experimental results from my work demonstrate Kriformer''s exceptional performance
    in representation learning for unobserved locations, validated on real-world traffic
    speed datasets. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of how we understand
    and estimate data in complex systems, and I look forward to further exploring
    innovative solutions in this field.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in numerical methods and control systems,
    with a focus on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of computational techniques
    in various applications. My recent work has led to the development of advanced
    schemes like the multi-moment constrained finite volume method (MCV3) and its
    variants, which significantly improve numerical accuracy and stability in fluid
    dynamics simulations. I have also contributed to the formulation of the CIP/multi-moment
    finite volume method (CIP/MM FVM), enabling arbitrary order accuracy in reconstruction
    processes.


    In the realm of control systems, I have tackled complex challenges such as designing
    dissipative estimators for continuous time-delay systems using the Krasovskii
    functional framework. My innovative approach, which incorporates the Kronecker-Seuret
    Decomposition, allows for effective handling of distributed delays without introducing
    conservatism, streamlining the design process.


    Additionally, I have developed ICSTrace, a novel model for malicious IP traceback
    in industrial control systems, which leverages existing infrastructure to enhance
    security without requiring new services. My research also extends to multi-agent
    systems, where I have proposed protocols for finite-time consensus and average-agreement
    problems, addressing the challenges posed by switching topologies and asynchronous
    communication.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    ensuring that my contributions not only push the boundaries of knowledge but also
    provide tangible benefits in real-world scenarios.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            Abstract\nLearning representation for\
    \ graph classi\uFB01cation\nturns a variable-size graph into a \uFB01xed-size\
    \ vector\n(or matrix). Such a representation works nicely with\nalgebraic manipulations.\
    \ Here we introduce a sim-\nple method to augment an attributed graph with a\n\
    virtual node that is bidirectionally connected to all\nexisting nodes. The virtual\
    \ node represents the la-\ntent aspects of the graph, which are not immediately\n\
    available from the attributes and local connectivity\nstructures. The expanded\
    \ graph is then put through\nany node representation method. The representation\n\
    of the virtual node is then the representation of the\nentire graph. In this paper,\
    \ we use the recently in-\ntroduced Column Network for the expanded graph,\nresulting\
    \ in a new end-to-end graph classi\uFB01cation\nmodel dubbed Virtual Column Network\
    \ (VCN). The\nmodel is validated on two tasks: (i) predicting bio-\nactivity of\
    \ chemical compounds, and (ii) \uFB01nding\nsoftware vulnerability from source\
    \ code.Results\nFig. 3 reports the performance on Code classi\uFB01cation task\
    \ in\nAUC and F1-score. VCN outperforms all the baselines on\nboth measures.\n\
    4results in a new graph classi\uFB01cation method called\nVirtual Column Network\
    \ (VCN). We demonstrate the power\nof the VCN on two tasks: (i) classi\uFB01cation\
    \ of bio-activity of\nchemical compounds against a given cancer; (ii) detecting\
    \ soft-\nware vulnerability from source code. Overall, the automatic\nrepresentation\
    \ learning is more powerful than state-of-the art\nfeature engineering.\nThere\
    \ are rooms open for further investigations. First, we\ncan use multiple virtual\
    \ nodes instead of just one.The graph\nis then embedded into a matrix whose columns\
    \ are vector\nrepresentation of virtual nodes. This will be bene\uFB01cial in\
    \ sev-\neral ways. For multitask learning, each virtual node will be\nused for\
    \ a task and all tasks share the same node represen-\ntations. For big graphs\
    \ with tight subgraph structures, each\nvirtual node can target a subgraph. Second,\
    \ other node rep-\nresentation architectures beside Column Networks are also\n\
    applicable for deriving graph representation, including Gated\nGraph Sequence\
    \ Neural Network [Liet al. , 2016 ], Graph\nNeural Network [Scarselli et al. ,\
    \ 2009 ]and diffusion-CNN\n[Atwood and Towsley, 2016 ].Experiments\nWe demonstrate\
    \ the effectiveness of our model against the\nbaselines on BioAssay activity prediction\
    \ tasks and a code\nclassi\uFB01cation task.3.1 Experiment settings\nFor allexperiments\

    \ where nodes are atoms and edges are\nbonds between them. We chose the 2 most\
    \ common activities\nfor classi\uFB01cation: \u201Cactive\u201D and \u201Cinactive\u201D\
    . The statistics of\ndata is reported in Table 1. These datasets are unbalanced,\n\
    therefore \u201Cinactive\u201D compounds are randomly removed so that\neach of\
