  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nAutomatic speaker verification\
    \ (ASV) systems have become in-\ncreasingly important in the field of voice recognition\
    \ technol-\nogy including their applications in security systems, banking,\ncall\
    \ centers, law enforcement, fraud prevention, criminal inves-\ntigations, and\
    \ healthcare. Modern deep learning based ASV\nsystems [1] involve three phases:\
    \ (1) training of speaker em-\nbedding extractor; (2) enrollment to create a reference\
    \ model of\nthe target speakers; and (3) verification to validate a speaker\u2019\
    s\nclaimed identity based on the similarity between the enrollment\nand verification\
    \ recordings (ASV score).\nSimilar to other biometrics, ASV systems are not perfect.\
    \ It\nis evident that the accuracy of the ASV system depends strongly\non how\
    \ closely the enrollment and verification conditions are\nmatched [2, 3]. Over\
    \ the years, extensive prior research works\nhave addressed the effects of various\
    \ mismatch factors between\nenrolment and verification phases, including background\
    \ environment, etc. Moreover, the\ndegradation in EER within the LCFSH dataset\
    \ for different age-\ning conditions is consistent and well-evident, likely due\
    \ to age-\ngroups with larger age gaps.\nSimilar to V oxCeleb1-Age-Enriched (USA),\
    \ all fixed effect\ncoefficients (C1, C3, C4, and C6) are negative in the LCFSH\n\
    dataset. The fixed effect coefficients for target scores (C1 and\nC4) are notably\
    \ larger in magnitude than those for non-target\nscores, indicating that, like\
    \ in English, Finnish target scores are\nmore sensitive to ageing than non-target\
    \ scores. Furthermore,\nwe observe in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that the x-axes for\
    \ non-target\nscores are limited to a narrow range, while the target scores in\n\
    Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c are distributed more widely. This further\nconfirms that target\
    \ scores are more impacted due to ageing.\nUnlike the methods, such as linear\
    \ mixed effect (LME) [24]\nmodels, which enable jointly modeling the random and\
    \ fixed ef-\nfects in ASV scores. LMEs are a type of statistical model used\n\
    to analyze grouped data using regression techniques.\nTo summarize, our study\
    \ has the following main contribu-\ntions:\n\u2022 Unlike most prior studies that\
    \ have analyzed the ageing effect\nusing a single language only, our study includes\
    \ two very dif-\nferent languages and datasets namely, V oxCeleb and LCFSH.\n\u2022\
    \ Studies are conducted separately for male and female speak-\ners to understand\
    \ the impact of ageing across the gender.\n\u2022 As opposed to the previous studies\
    \ that rely mean of scores,\nwe have conducted extensive experiments\nusing the\
    \ SpeechBrain toolkit [30]. Specifically, we use the\nECAPA-TDNN based ASV system\
    \ that achieves state-of-the-\nart performance [22]. We use cosine similarity\
    \ measure fol-\nlowed by the score normalized using adaptive s-norm [31, 32].\n\
    The ECAPA-TDNN model trained on V oxCeleb2 achieves EER\nof1.28% and1.95% on the\
    \ V ox1-O and V ox1-E datasets, re-\nspectively.\n4. Methodology\nWe use the linear\
    \ mixed effect (LME) [24] models to analyze\nthe variation in the ASV score with\
    \ respect to the age differ-\nence under different gender, language, and session\
    \ conditions.\nWe fit the following model to ASV score data under different\n\
    conditions:\nSi=\xB5+\u03B2\u2217\u03B4i+\u03B3 (1)\nwhere Siis ASV score of i-th\
    \ trial, \xB5is intercept or mean of the\nASV scores in a particular condition,\
    \ \u03B4iis the age difference\nbetween enrollment and verification audio, \u03B2\
    is fixed effect co-\nefficient that establishes a linear relationship between\
    \ age dif-\nference ( \u03B4i) and ASV score Si, and\u03B3is a random effect which\
    \ is\ninduced by other variabilities such as Results and Discussions\n5.1. Analyzing\
    \ the Impact of Ageing on VoxCeleb1-Age-\nEnriched (USA)\nFigure 4a displays the\
    \ gender and age distribution of speak-\ners\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n\
