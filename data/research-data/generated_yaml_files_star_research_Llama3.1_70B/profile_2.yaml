  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing network security through the
    application of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realm
    of autonomous agents and reinforcement learning. My work addresses the inherent
    challenges faced by defenders in the cybersecurity landscape, where attackers
    only need to succeed once while defenders must thwart every attempt. I have developed
    novel reinforcement learning agents capable of effectively defending against sophisticated
    attacks, including those from advanced persistent threats (APTs).


    In my recent projects, I have introduced an end-to-end methodology for studying
    attack strategies and designing defense agents, achieving significant performance
    improvements over previous approaches. I also explore the implications of generative
    large language models (LLMs) in terms of accountability and copyright issues,
    proposing methods to trace the origins of fine-tuned models back to their pre-trained
    bases.


    Additionally, I have investigated the resilience of communication networks in
    disaster relief scenarios, particularly when faced with compromised drones. By
    leveraging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, I have developed strategies
    that maximize communication bandwidth despite ongoing adversarial interference.
    My research emphasizes the importance of information-rich observations, expert-guided
    learning, and reward optimization to enhance the performance of learning-based
    agents.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in machine
    learning and practical applications in network defense, ultimately contributing
    to more robust and autonomous cybersecurity solutions.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in network security, particularly in the
    detection of malicious activities and the development of autonomous defense mechanisms.
    My recent work has focused on combating domain generation algorithms (DGAs) used
    by botnets and malware. I developed a hybrid neural network model, Bilbo, which
    combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
    networks for effective DGA detection. This model has proven to outperform existing
    architectures in various classification tasks, successfully identifying potential
    threats in real-time network traffic.


    In addition to DGA detection, I explore the application of reinforcement learning
    in network defense. I designed a novel agent capable of defending against advanced
    persistent threats in a simulated network environment, demonstrating its effectiveness
    in countering continual attacks. My research also delves into the visualization
    of symmetries in neural networks through an efficient algorithm called GENNI,
    which enhances our understanding of model identifiability and optimization.


    I am particularly interested in establishing causal relationships in intrusion
    research, employing adaptive designs inspired by clinical trials to improve the
    accuracy of our findings. My work in this area has led to significant improvements
    in honeypot deployment studies, allowing for more efficient data collection and
    analysis.

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            Abstract\nAutonomous Cyber Operations\
    \ (ACO) involves the\ndevelopment of blue team (defender) and red team\n(attacker)\
    \ decision-making agents in adversarial\nscenarios. To support the application\
    \ of machine\nlearning algorithms to solve this problem, and to\nencourage researchers\
    \ in this \uFB01eld to attend to prob-\nlems in the ACO setting, we introduce\
    \ CybORG, a\nwork-in-progress gym for ACO research. CybORG\nfeatures a simulation\
    \ and emulation environment\nwith a common interface to facilitate the rapid\n\
    training of autonomous agents that can then be\ntested on real-world systems.\
    \ Initial testing demon-\nstrates the feasibility of this approach.\n1Background\n\
    Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) is concerned with\nthe defence of computer systems\
    \ and networks through au-\ntonomous decision-making and action. It is particularly\n\
    needed where deploying security experts to cover every net-\nwork and location\
    \ is becoming increasingly untenable, and\nwhere systems cannot be reliably accessed\
    \ by human defend-\ners, either due to unreliable communication channels or ad-\n\
    versary action.\nThe ACO domain is challenging to develop arti\uFB01cial intelli-\n\
    gence (AI) approaches for as it combines hard problems from\nother domains of\
    \ AI research. Like game AI, it is adversar-\nial: the effectiveness of a defensive\
    \ cyber agent is determined\nby its ability to respond to an adversary. Like autonomous\n\
    robotics, ACO is affected by the \u2018reality gap\u2019 [Ibarz et al. ,\n2021\
    \ ], as simulations of an environment willabstract away\ninformation that could\
    \ be critical to an agent\u2019s effectiveness.\nA further issue for the ACO domain\
    \ is that the environment\nand action set change as cyber security research progresses,\n\
    which is far more rapidly than either of the domains discussed\nabove.\nThe requirement\
    \ to handle the varying actions of an adver-\nsary, in a complex environment,\
    \ precludes the use of static\ndata sets to learn ACO behaviour. A tool for learning\
    \ in ad-\nversarial environments is an AI Gym. AI Gyms such as the\none developed\
    \ by OpenAI implement reinforcement learning(RL) through direct interaction with\
    \ a simulation of the prob-\nlem. A path to addressing the \u2018reality gap\u2019\
    , used in [Tanet\nal., 2016 ], is to combine learning on simulations with testing\n\
    in a real environment. In this case, the bulk of learning is\nconducted on simulated\
    \ systems. Successful agents are trans-\nferred to the real system to \uFB01rstly\
    \ validate their effectiveness,\nand secondly to re\uFB01ne the simulation.\n\
    We believe that AI Gyms, that can be validated and re-\n\uFB01ned throughexperiments,\
    \ the requirements of ACO motivate an in-\ntegrated design comprising emulation\
    \ and simulation modes\nto support large scale RL across diverse scenarios.\n\
    We have made progress towards implementing this design,\nwith the ability to spawn\
    \ and play games either in simula-\ntion mode or emulation mode with cloud infrastructure.\
    \ In\nCybORG, we can now train an RL agent in simulation then\ntest its effectiveness\
    \ in emulation. TheRelated Work\nThere are a growing number of cyber security\
    \ environments\ndesigned for experimentation. A summary of several environ-\n\
    ments, with an assessment of how they \uFB01t our requirements,\ncan be found\
    \ in Table 1.\nDETERlab [Mirkovic et al. , 2010 ]is a specialised cy-\nber security\
    \ experimentation environment based on EMU-\nlab[Stoller et al. , 2008 ]. It supports\
    \ cyber security experi-\nmentation through the emulation of hosts and networks.\
    \ As\nit relies on local hardware, DETERlab has limited maximum\nnetwork size\
    \ and takes a signi\uFB01cant amount of time to reset or\nrecon\uFB01gure. VINE\
