  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  In recent years,\
    \ there has been growing excitement about improving the generalization of deep\
    \ networks by regularizing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Among optimizers\
    \ that explicitly minimize sharpness, Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) (Foret\
    \ et al., 2020) garnered popularity for achieving state-of-the-art performance\
    \ on various natural image and language benchmarks. Compared to stochastic gradient\
    \ descent (SGD), SAM provides consistent improvements of several percentage points.\
    \ Interestingly, a less widely known finding from Foret et al. (2020) is that\
    \ SAM’s most prominent gains lie elsewhere, in the presence of random label noise.\
    \ In fact, SAM is more robust to label noise than SGD by tens of percentage points,\
    \ rivaling the current best label noise techniques (Jiang et al., 2017; Zhang\
    \ et al., 2017; Arazo et al., 2019). In Figure 1, we demonstrate this finding\
    \ in CIFAR10 with 30%percent\\%% label noise, where SAM’s best test accuracy is\
    \ 17%percent1717\\%17 % higher. In particular, we find that the robustness gains\
    \ are most prominent in a particular version of SAM called 1-SAM which applies\
    \ the perturbation step to each sample in the minibatch separately.   An important\
    \ caveat about the random label noise setting is that the test accuracy does not\
    \ improve with further training, but instead peaks in the middle. Consequently,\
    \ we argue understanding SAM in this regime requires a departure from reducing\
    \ SAM to the sharpness of its solution at convergence, but instead reasoning about\
    \ SAM’s “early learning” behavior. In fact, even in settings with a unique minimum,\
    \ the best test accuracy may change based on the optimization trajectory. Indeed,\
    \ the performance achieved by SAM does not diminish with underparametrization,\
    \ with the gains above SGD sometimes increasing with more data (Appendix F). \
    \  In this work, we investigate why 1-SAM is more robust to label noise than SGD\
    \ at a more mechanistic level. Decomposing the gradient of each example (“sample-wise”\
    \ gradient) by chain rule into ∇wℓ⁢(f⁢(w,x),y)=∂ℓ/∂f⋅∇wfsubscript∇\U0001D464ℓ\U0001D453\

    \ clean training accuracy before fitting the noisy data, i.e., when accuracy of\
    \ noisy training data surpasses random chance. This corresponds with a higher\
    \ peak in test accuracy.   We begin our study in linear models, where the only\
    \ difference between SAM and SGD is the logit scale term. Here, we show that SAM\
    \ reduces to a reweighting scheme that explicitly up-weights the gradient contribution\
    \ of low loss points. This effect is particularly useful in the presence of mislabeled\
    \ examples. When training with gradient descent, correctly labeled or clean examples\
    \ initially dominate the direction of the update and as a result, their corresponding\
    \ loss decreases first before that of mislabeled or noisy examples (Liu et al.,\
    \ 2020; 2023). Similar to many existing label-noise techniques (Liu et al., 2020),\
    \ SAM’s explicit up-weighting keeps the gradient contribution of\n\n         \
