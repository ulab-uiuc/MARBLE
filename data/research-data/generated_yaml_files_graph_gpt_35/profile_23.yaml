  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the exploration of attention mechanisms
    within deep learning, particularly in the context of transformers. My recent work
    focuses on deriving self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel
    PCA), which has allowed me to uncover the theoretical foundations of how self-attention
    operates. By projecting query vectors onto the principal component axes of the
    key matrix, I have formulated a precise representation of the value matrix in
    self-attention, revealing its connection to the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix
    of key vectors.


    Building on this framework, I introduced Attention with Robust Principal Components
    (RPC-Attention), a novel approach designed to enhance the resilience of attention
    mechanisms against data contamination. Through empirical evaluations across various
    tasks, including object classification, language modeling, and image segmentation,
    I have demonstrated the superior performance of RPC-Attention compared to traditional
    softmax attention. My research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical
    applications, contributing to the ongoing evolution of robust and efficient deep
    learning models.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of transformer
    architectures and graph neural networks (GNNs) through innovative regularization
    techniques and robust modeling frameworks. My recent work has focused on addressing
    critical challenges such as over-smoothing and input corruption in these models.
    For instance, I introduced the $p$-Laplacian Transformer (p-LaT), which utilizes
    $p$-Laplacian regularization to better capture heterophilic features in self-attention
    layers, allowing for more nuanced attention mechanisms.


    Additionally, I developed Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention),
    which derives self-attention from kernel principal component analysis, enhancing
    resilience to data contamination. My research also led to the creation of the
    Neural Transformer with a Regularized Nonlocal Functional (NeuTRENO), which effectively
    mitigates the over-smoothing issue by preserving the fidelity of token representations.


    In the realm of GNNs, I proposed the Kuramoto Graph Neural Network (KuramotoGNN),
    leveraging the Kuramoto model to prevent node feature convergence while maintaining
    stability. Furthermore, I explored the integration of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative
    (PID) control system into transformer architectures, resulting in the PID-controlled
    Transformer (PIDformer), which enhances robustness and representation capacity.


    Through these contributions, I aim to push the boundaries of deep learning models,
    making them more interpretable, robust, and effective across various applications
    in natural language processing and computer vision.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Scaling up deep models\
    \ has demonstrated significant potential for enhancing the model’s performance\
    \ on a wide range of cognitive and machine learning tasks, ranging from large\
    \ language model pre-training [13, 58, 59, 30, 5, 51, 70] and vision understanding [15,\
    \ 2, 3, 39, 1, 40] to reinforcement learning [6, 28] and scientific applications [66,\
    \ 74]. However, increasing the model’s size requires a higher computational budget,\
    \ which can be often challenging to meet. As a result, Sparse Mixture of Experts\
    \ (SMoE) has been recently studied as an efficient approach to effectively scale\
    \ up deep models. By modularizing the network and activating only subsets of experts\
    \ for each input, SMoE maintains constant computational costs while increasing\
    \ model complexity. This approach enables the development of billion-parameter\
    \ models and achieves significant success in various applications, including machine\
    \ translation [35], image classification [61], and speech recognition [34].††Please\
    \ correspond to: rachel.tsy@u.nus.edu    1.1 Sparse Mixture of Experts  A MoE\
    \ replaces a component in the layer of the model, for example, a feed-forward\
    \ or convolutional layer, by a set of networks termed experts. This approach largely\
    \ scales up the model but increases the computational cost. A SMoE inherits the\
    \ extended model capacity from MoE but preserves the computational overhead by\
    \ taking advantage of conditional computation. In particular, a SMoE consists\
    \ of a router and E\U0001D438Eitalic_E expert networks, uisubscript\U0001D462\U0001D456\
