  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning
    and graph theory, with a particular focus on the symmetries and structures that
    underpin neural networks. My recent work has explored the concept of canonicalization,
    providing a unified framework for designing frame-averaging methods that enhance
    the invariance and equivariance of neural networks. By establishing a connection
    between frames and canonical forms, I have developed novel frames for eigenvectors
    that outperform existing methods both theoretically and empirically.


    I have also investigated the impact of parameter space symmetries on neural network
    performance, introducing architectures that reduce these symmetries to improve
    training efficiency and model behavior. My empirical studies have revealed significant
    insights into phenomena such as linear mode connectivity and Bayesian neural network
    training.


    In addition, I have contributed to the burgeoning field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs), advocating for a balanced theoretical understanding that encompasses expressive
    power, generalization, and optimization. My work on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs)
    has opened new avenues for leveraging these weights in machine learning models,
    leading to innovative approaches for predicting model performance and detecting
    harmful finetunes.


    Through my research, I aim to advance our understanding of neural networks and
    GNNs, developing architectures that respect the inherent symmetries of data while
    pushing the boundaries of what these models can achieve. My commitment to open
    science is reflected in my code releases, which I hope will inspire further exploration
    in this exciting field.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Neural networks are\
    \ well-established for predicting, generating, and transforming data. A newer\
    \ paradigm is to treat the parameters of neural networks themselves as data. This\
    \ insight inspired researchers to suggest neural architectures that can predict\
    \ properties of trained neural networks (Eilertsen et al., 2020), generate new\
    \ networks (Erkoç et al., 2023), optimize networks (Metz et al., 2022), or otherwise\
    \ transform them (Navon et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a). We refer to these neural\
    \ networks that process other neural networks as metanetworks, or metanets for\
    \ short.   Metanets enable new applications, but designing them is nontrivial.\
    \ A common approach is to flatten the network parameters into a vector representation,\
    \ neglecting the input network structure. More generally, a prominent challenge\
    \ in metanet design is that the space of neural network parameters exhibits symmetries.\
    \ For example, permuting the neurons in the hidden layers of a Multilayer Perceptron\
    \ (MLP) leaves the network output unchanged (Hecht-Nielsen, 1990). Ignoring these\
    \ symmetries greatly degrades the metanet performance (Peebles et al., 2022; Navon\
    \ et al., 2023). Instead, equivariant metanets respect these symmetries, so that\
    \ if the input network is permuted then the metanet output is permuted in the\
    \ same way.   Recently, several works have proposed equivariant metanets that\
    \ have shown significantly improved performance (Navon et al., 2023; Zhou et al.,\
    \ 2023a; b). However, these networks typically require highly specialized, hand-designed\
    \ layers that can be difficult to devise. A careful analysis of its symmetries\
    \ is necessary for any input architecture, followed by the design of corresponding\
    \ equivariant metanet layers. Generalizing this procedure to more complicated\
    \ network architectures is time-consuming and nontrivial, so existing methods\
    \ can only process simple input networks with linear and convolutional layers,\
    \ and cannot process standard modules such as normalization layers or residual\
    \ connections — let alone more complicated modules such as attention blocks. Moreover,\
    \ these architectures cannot directly process input neural networks with varying\
    \ architectures, such as those with different numbers of layers or hidden units.\
    \   This work offers a simple and elegant solution to metanet design that respects\
    \ neural network parameter symmetries. As in the concurrent work of Zhang et al.\
    \ (2023), our technique’s crux is representing an input neural network as a graph\
    \ (see Figure 1). We show how to efficiently transform a neural network into a\
    \ graph such that standard techniques for learning on graphs – e.g., Message Passing\
    \ Neural Networks Gilmer et al. (2017); Battaglia et al. (2018) or Graph Transformers (Rampášek\
    \ et al., 2022) – will be equivariant to the parameter symmetries. One of our\
    \ key contributions is in developing a compact parameter graph representation,\
    \ which in contrast to established computation graphs allows us to handle parameter-sharing\
    \ layers like convolutions and attention layers without scaling with the activation\
    \ count. While past work is typically restricted to processing MLPs and simple\
    \ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (LeCun et al., 1989), we validate experimentally\
    \ that our graph metanets (GMNs) generalize to more complicated networks such\
    \ as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), residual networks (He et al., 2016),\
    \ normalization layers (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Ba et al., 2016; Wu & He, 2018),\
    \ general group-equivariant architectures (Ravanbakhsh et al., 2017) like Deep\
    \ Sets (Zaheer et al., 2017), and more.   We prove theoretically that our metanets\
    \ are equivariant to permutation symmetries in the input network, which we formulate\
    \ via neural graph automorphisms (Section 2.2). This generalizes\n\n         \
