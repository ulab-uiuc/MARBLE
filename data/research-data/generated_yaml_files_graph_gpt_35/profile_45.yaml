  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to understanding and improving the experiences
    of individuals in various contexts, particularly focusing on international migrants,
    education, healthcare, and human-computer interaction (HCI). My recent work explores
    the challenges faced by international migrants in accessing information and the
    role of information providers in bridging gaps beyond co-national networks. I
    have conducted in-depth interviews to uncover how these providers navigate language
    barriers and knowledge disparities, aiming to inform the design of information
    and communication technologies that better serve migrants'' needs.


    In the realm of education, I have investigated how students utilize their waiting
    time and how this can inform time management tools. My research also delves into
    predictive modeling for student performance using fine-grained log data from programming
    environments, demonstrating the potential of differential sequence mining to enhance
    instructional strategies.


    Additionally, I have contributed to advancements in machine learning, particularly
    in apprenticeship learning and missing data imputation in electronic health records.
    My work on the Time-aware Hierarchical EM Energy-based Sub-trajectory (THEMES)
    framework addresses evolving reward functions in healthcare, while the Time-Aware
    Dual-Cross-Visit method significantly improves missing value imputation by leveraging
    multivariate and longitudinal dependencies.


    Overall, my research aims to create practical solutions that enhance well-being
    and decision-making across diverse domains, driven by a commitment to understanding
    the nuanced needs of individuals in complex environments.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures. For instance, I developed
    Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional context of nodes
    within graphs, significantly improving performance in tasks like link prediction
    and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identities during message passing. This
    innovation has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My exploration of dynamic graphs culminated in the ROLAND framework, which
    allows static GNNs to adapt to dynamic environments, showcasing the scalability
    and efficiency of my approaches.


    Beyond architectural advancements, I have delved into the design space of GNNs,
    systematically studying over 315,000 designs to provide guidelines for optimizing
    performance across different tasks. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON
    and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the search for optimal model designs, making
    it more efficient and insightful.


    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for understanding and improving the
    interplay between graph structures and machine learning, with the goal of making
    GNNs more effective and accessible for real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in advanced machine learning techniques,
    particularly in the realms of online learning, contextual bandits, and large-scale
    data analysis. My work has focused on developing innovative algorithms that enhance
    computational efficiency and statistical performance across various applications.
    For instance, I introduced RandomizedCCA, a randomized algorithm for canonical
    correlation analysis that excels in handling large datasets with minimal data
    passes, making it ideal for distributed processing environments.


    I have also made significant contributions to the field of sequential inference
    with my work on confidence sequences, which provide robust coverage guarantees
    for running averages in challenging statistical settings. My research extends
    to online learning algorithms that are independent of feature scales, allowing
    for more robust and efficient model training without the need for pre-normalization.


    In tackling the complexities of multiclass and multilabel classification, I have
    developed fast label embedding algorithms that leverage low-dimensional representations,
    achieving state-of-the-art results on large-scale datasets. My exploration of
    contextual bandits has led to the creation of risk-averse algorithms that maintain
    performance in worst-case scenarios, addressing critical challenges in dynamic

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Language agents based\
    \ on large language models (LLMs) have been developed for a variety of applications\
    \ (Dohmke, 2022; Brynjolfsson et al., 2023), following recent breakthroughs in\
    \ improving LLMs (Achiam et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022b; Team et al., 2023).\
    \ However, despite their impressive zero-shot performance, LLMs still need to\
    \ align to a given user and task (Mysore et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). In many\
    \ applications, a natural feedback for LLM-based agents is user edits, where a\
    \ user queries the agent and edits the agent’s response before their own final\
    \ use. In contrast, typical feedback used for fine-tuning, such as the comparison-based\
    \ preference feedback in RLHF, is explicitly collected by providing annotators\
    \ with model responses and asking them to rank (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon\
    \ et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022a, inter alia), making\
    \ such feedback an expensive choice for improving alignment. Motivated by this\
    \ observation, we focus on interactive learning of LLM-based language agents using\
    \ user edits as feedback. ∗Equal contribution. 1Our code and data are publicly\
