  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to the field of natural language processing
    (NLP), with a particular focus on text generation. My work centers around the
    challenge of enabling machines to express themselves in human language, a task
    that has seen significant advancements since the introduction of neural encoder-decoder
    models like Seq2Seq in 2014. However, I recognize that relying solely on input
    text often limits the effectiveness of these models in generating high-quality
    outputs.


    To address this challenge, I have explored the promising area of knowledge-enhanced
    text generation, which integrates various forms of knowledge beyond the input
    text into generation models. My recent survey comprehensively reviews the advancements
    in this field over the past five years, detailing general methods and architectures
    for knowledge integration, as well as specific techniques and applications tailored
    to different types of knowledge data.


    I aim to bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications,
    making my findings accessible to both researchers and practitioners in the industry.
    My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of what machines can achieve in language
    generation, ultimately striving for more nuanced and contextually aware outputs.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Adversarial robustness\
    \ is the study of model performance in the worst-case scenario, which is a key\
    \ element in trust- worthy machine learning. Without further remediation, state-\
    \ of-the-art machine learning models, especially neural net- works, are known\
    \ to be overly sensitive to small human- imperceptible perturbations to data inputs\
    \ [ 19]. Such a prop- erty of over-sensitivity could be exploited by bad actors\
    \ to craft adversarial perturbations leading to prediction-evasive adversarial\
    \ examples. Given a threat model specifying the knowledge of the target machine\
    \ learning model (e.g., white-box or black-box model access) and the setting of\
    \ plausible adversarial in- terventions (e.g., norm-bounded input perturbations),\
    \ the methodology for adversarial robustness evaluation can be divided into two\
    \ categories: attack-dependent andattack- independent . Attack-dependent approaches\
    \ aim to devise the strongest possible attack and use it for performance assess-\
    \ ment. A typical example is Auto-Attack [ 12], a state-of-the- art attack based\
    \ on an ensemble of advanced white-box and black-box adversarial perturbation\
    \ methods Table 7 shows the best ranking coefﬁcient we achieved on each calibration\
    \ option for CIFAR-10. Among all these four calibration choices, we found that\
    \ Sigmoid then Temperature Softmax achieves the best result. A.7. Approximation\
    \ Error and Sample Complexity Figure 5 presents the sample complexity as analyzed\
    \ in Theorem 2 with varying approximation error ( \x0F) and three conﬁdence parameters\
    \ ( \x0E) for quantifying the difference be- tween the sample mean and the true\
    \ mean for global robust- ness estimation. As expected, smaller \x0Eor smaller\x0F\
    will lead to higher sample complexity. A.8. Complete Run-time Background and Related\
    \ Works Adversarial Attack and Defense. In classiﬁcation tasks, adversarial attacks\
    \ aim to generate adversarial examples that evade the correct prediction of a\
    \ classiﬁer. In principle, ad- versarial examples can be crafted by small perturbations\
    \ to a native data sample, where the level of perturbation is mea- sured by different\
    \ Lpnorms [ 7,8,55]. The procedure of ﬁnding adversarial perturbation within a\
    \ perturbation level is often formulated as a constrained optimization problem,\
    \ which can be solved by algorithms such as projected gradient descent (PGD) [\
    \ 37]. The state-of-the-art adversarial attack is the Auto-Attack [ 12], which\
    \ uses an ensemble of white-box and black-box attacks. There are many Appendix\

    \ Section 3.1 Table 6: Main notations used in this paper A.2. More Motivations\
    \ on using Generative Models for Robustness Evaluation We emphasize the necessity\
    \ of generative models using the points below. 1.Global robustness assessment\
    \ requires a GM . The ma- jor focus and novelty of our study are to evaluate the\
    \ global robustness with respect to the underlying true data distribution, and\
    \ we propose to use a GM as a proxy. We argue that such a proxy is necessary to\
    \ eval- uate global robustness unless the true data distribution is known. 2.GAN\
    \ can provably match data distribution. Recent works such as [ 50] and [ 33] have\
    \ proved the conver- gence rate of approaching the true data distribution for\
    \ a family of GANs under certain conditions. This will beneﬁt global robustness\
    \ evaluation (see Figure 3 for ablations on GAN variants). 3.Privacy-sensitive\
    \ remote model auditing. As shown in Sec 4.5, synthetic data from generative models\
    \ can facilitate the robustness evaluation of privacy-sensitive models. A.3. Proof\
    \ of Theorem 1 In this section, we will give detailed\n\n            **Your Task**\n\
