    temporal action detection (TAD), with a focus on developing innovative models
    that address the unique challenges of these fields. My recent work has explored
    lexicon-free modeling units for Korean ASR, where I introduced various units such
    as syllable-based and Jamo characters, achieving significant performance improvements
    in both Korean and Korean-English code-switching tasks.


    In the realm of TAD, I have tackled critical issues such as attention collapse
    in DETR-based models. My proposed frameworks, including Self-DETR and Long-Term
    Pre-training (LTP), have demonstrated substantial advancements in model performance
    by enhancing self-attention mechanisms and addressing data scarcity challenges.
    Additionally, I developed the Boundary-Recovering Network (BRN) to mitigate the
    vanishing boundary problem, which has proven effective in localizing actions of
    varying lengths.


    My interdisciplinary approach combines insights from machine learning, video analysis,
    and even theoretical physics, as seen in my work on generalized van der Waals
    equations. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible in
    ASR and TAD, and I strive to create models that not only perform well but also
    contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes in these complex
    domains.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Diffusion probabilistic\
    \ models have achieved significant success in generating images (Ho et al., 2020;\
    \ Song et al., 2021b; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2022). On top of\
    \ the success in the image domain, there has been rapid progress in the generation\
    \ of videos (Ho et al., 2022; Singer et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\
    \ 2023b).   Despite the progress, long video generation still lags behind compared\
    \ to image generation. One reason is that video diffusion models (VDMs) often\
    \ consider a video as a single 4D tensor with an additional axis corresponding\
    \ to time, which prevents the models from generating videos at scale. An intuitive\
    \ approach to generating a long video is autoregressive generation, which iteratively\
    \ predicts a future frame given the previous ones. However, in contrast to the\
    \ transformer-based models (Hong et al., 2023; Villegas et al., 2023), diffusion-based\
    \ models cannot directly adopt the autoregressive generation strategy due to the\
    \ heavy computational costs incurred by iterative denoising steps for a single\
    \ frame generation. Instead, many recent works (Ho et al., 2022; He et al., 2022;\
    \ Voleti et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Blattmann et al.,\
    \ 2023) adopt a chunked autoregressive generation strategy, which predicts several\
    \ frames in parallel conditioned on few preceding ones, consequently reducing\
    \ computational burden. While these approaches are computationally tractable,\
    \ they often leads to temporal inconsistency and discontinuous motion, especially\
    \ between the chunks predicted separately, since the model captures a limited\
    \ temporal context available in the last few—only one or two in practice—frames.\
    \   The proposed inference technique, FIFO-Diffusion, realizes the long video\
    \ generation even without training. It facilitates generating videos with arbitrary\
    \ lengths, based on a diffusion model for video generation pretrained on short\
    \ clips. Moreover, it effectively alleviates the limitations of the chunked autoregressive\
    \ method by enabling every frame to refer to a sufficient number of preceding\
    \ frames.   Our approach generates frames through diagonal denoising (Section 4.1)\
    \ in a first-in-first-out manner using a queue, which maintains a sequence of\
    \ frames with different—monotonically increasing—noise levels over time. At each\
    \ step, a completely denoised frame at the head is popped out from the queue while\
    \ a new random noise image is pushed back at the tail. Diagonal denoising offers\
    \ both advantage and disadvantage; noisier frames benefit from referring to cleaner\
    \ ones at preceding diffusion steps while the model may suffer from training-inference\
    \ gap in terms of the noise levels of concurrently processed frames. To overcome\
    \ this limitation and embrace the advantage of diagonal denoising, we propose\
    \ latent partitioning (Section 4.2) and lookahead denoising (Section 4.3). Latent\
    \ partitioning constrains the range of noise levels in the noisy input images\
    \ and enhances video quality by finer discretization of diffusion process. Additionally,\
    \ lookahead denoising enhances the capacity of the baseline model, providing even\
    \ more accurate noise prediction. Furthermore, both latent partitioning and lookahead\
    \ denoising offer parallelizability on multiple GPUs.   Our main contributions\
    \ are summarized below.   •  We propose FIFO-Diffusion through diagonal denoising,\
    \ which is a training-free video generation technique for VDMs trained on short\
    \ clips. Our approach allows each frame to refer to a sufficient number of preceding\
    \ frames and facilitates the generation of arbitrarily long videos.    •  We introduce\
    \ latent partitioning and lookahead denoising, which enhances generation quality\
    \ and demonstrate the effectiveness of those two techniques theoretically and\
    \ empirically.    •  FIFO-Diffusion utilizes a constant amount of memory regardless\
    \ of the generating\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
