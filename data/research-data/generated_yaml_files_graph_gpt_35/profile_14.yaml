  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of efficiency
    and performance in deep learning, particularly through the lens of dynamic sparse
    training (DST) and its applications across various domains. My recent work challenges
    the conventional wisdom surrounding dense training, demonstrating that DST can
    not only match but often exceed the robustness of dense models, especially in
    image and video classification tasks. This revelation opens new avenues for enhancing
    deep learning robustness without incurring additional resource costs.


    In my pursuit of improving time series classification, I developed a dynamic sparse
    network (DSN) that adapts its receptive field dynamically, achieving state-of-the-art
    performance while significantly reducing computational costs. My investigations
    into sparse neural networks (SNNs) have revealed their potential to excel in learning
    from hard samples, providing insights into their behavior and efficiency in data-centric
    AI.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the evolution of convolutional networks by
    proposing the Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), which leverages extremely large
    kernels to compete with state-of-the-art transformer models. My work also extends
    to automatic speech recognition, where I introduced dynamic data pruning techniques
    that optimize training efficiency without sacrificing performance.


    Through these diverse projects, I aim to push the boundaries of deep learning,
    making it more accessible and efficient while maintaining high performance across
    various applications. My research is publicly available, reflecting my commitment
    to transparency and collaboration in the scientific community.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricacies of transfer learning,
    particularly in the context of distant transfer learning. My recent work focuses
    on bridging the gap between unrelated domains through innovative methodologies.
    I developed the DeEp Random Walk basEd distaNt Transfer (DERWENT) method, which
    stands out by explicitly learning the paths of knowledge transfer using deep random
    walk techniques. This approach allows for a more structured and effective transfer
    of knowledge, even when source and target domains lack direct connections.


    Through my research, I aim to push the boundaries of how we understand and implement
    transfer learning, making it applicable to a wider range of scenarios. My empirical
    studies have shown that DERWENT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
    benchmark datasets, reinforcing my commitment to advancing the field. I am passionate

    (SNNs) and their applications across various domains. My work primarily focuses
    on addressing the challenges associated with sparsity in neural networks, particularly
    in enhancing their efficiency and performance without the need for extensive over-parameterization.
    I have contributed to the understanding of SNNs by clarifying common confusions
    in the community, which I believe is essential as the focus shifts from traditional
    pruning methods to more sophisticated forms of sparsity.


    My recent research has explored the benefits of intrinsically sparse neural networks,
    demonstrating their superior generalization capabilities compared to fully connected
    architectures. I have developed innovative techniques such as Sparse Evolutionary
    Training (SET) and Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampled Low-Rank Projection (OwLore),
    which optimize model performance while significantly reducing parameter counts.
    Additionally, I have investigated the training of sparse GANs from scratch, achieving
    impressive results without relying on dense pre-trained models.


    I am also passionate about applying my findings to practical challenges, such
    as improving path planning for unmanned surface vehicles in ocean environments
    and enhancing speech recognition models through low-rank weight training. My goal

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the exploration of cosmology and gravitational
    waves, with a particular focus on addressing the Hubble tension and understanding
    the nature of dark energy. My recent work introduces the exponential Acoustic
    Dark Energy (eADE) model, which offers a novel exponential form of the equation
    of state for dark energy, providing insights into cosmic microwave background
    (CMB) phenomena and yielding a best-fit value for the Hubble constant that is
    smaller than the standard ΛCDM model.


    I have also investigated the dynamic dark energy through the Interacting Chevallier-Polarski-Linder
    (ICPL) model, analyzing its characteristic 21-cm power spectrum and its implications
    for future observations, particularly in relation to the EDGES experiment. My
    research extends to the analysis of primordial gravitational waves using data
    from pulsar timing arrays, where I have examined Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational
    Wave models, revealing new parameter ranges that challenge traditional cosmic
    microwave background analyses.


    Additionally, I have explored the stochastic gravitational wave background generated
    during the reheating period of the universe, focusing on scenarios involving vector
    particles. My findings highlight the need for innovative high-frequency gravitational
    wave detectors to capture these elusive signals. Through my work, I aim to bridge

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n               1 Introduction  Figure 1: A comparison\
    \ of feature fusion schemes. The purple nodes depict features extracted from the\
    \ backbone, while the green nodes depict the fused features. In particular, in\
    \ DiNTS (d), red lines indicate information flow paths determined through neural\
    \ architecture search techniques. In E2ENet (e), the red lines with different\
    \ widths represent sparse information flows determined by the DSFF mechanism,\
    \ allowing for efficient feature fusion. E2ENet is capable of dynamically learning\
    \ how much of the features to fuse is derived from the backbone.   3D medical\
    \ image segmentation, plays an essential role in numerous clinical applications,\
    \ including computer-aided diagnosis (Yu et al., 2020b) and image-guided surgery\
    \ systems (Ronneberger et al., 2015), etc. Over the past decade, the rapid development\
    \ of deep neural networks has achieved tremendous breakthroughs and significantly\
    \ boosted the progress in this area (Zhou et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Isensee\
    \ et al., 2021). However, the model sizes and computational costs are also exploding,\
    \ which deter their deployment in many real-world applications, especially for\
    \ 3D models where resource consumption scales cubically (Hu et al., 2021; Valanarasu\
    \ & Patel, 2022). This naturally raises a research question: Can we design a 3D\
    \ medical image segmentation method that trades off accuracy and efficiency better\
    \ subjected to different resource availability?    Accurately segmenting organs\
    \ is a challenging task in 3D medical image segmentation due to the variability\
    \ in size and shape even among the same type of organ, caused by factors such\
    \ as patient anatomy and disease stage. This diversity amplifies the difficulty\
    \ to accurately identify and distinguish the boundaries of different organs, leading\
    \ to potential errors in segmentation. One of the main solutions for accurate\
    \ medical image segmentation is to favorably leverage the multi-scale features\
    \ extracted by the backbone network, but this remains a long-standing problem.\
    \ Pioneering work UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) utilizes skip connection to\
    \ propagate detailed information to high-level features. More recently, UNet++\
    \ (Zhou et al., 2018), CoTr (Xie et al., 2021) and DiNTS (He et al., 2021) have\
    \ developed more complex neural networks architectures (e.g. densely skip connections\
    \ and attention mechanism) or optimization techniques (e.g. neural architecture\
    \ search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019)) for cross-scale feature fusion. NAS initially\
    \ searches for the network topology and operator (e.g., 3x3 Convolution and Maxpool)\
    \ and subsequently optimize the model weights. However, NAS typically demands\
    \ a significant amount of computational resources for exploring the network topology\
    \ and assessing numerous candidate architectures, making it computationally expensive\
    \ and time-consuming. For instance, C2FNAS (Yu et al., 2020a) necessitates nearly\
    \ one GPU year to discover a single 3D segmentation architecture, DiNTS (He et al.,\
    \ 2021) improves the searching efficiency but still requires 5.8 GPU days to search\
    \ for a single architecture. Compared to NAS approaches, our method does not require\
    \ costly architecture search time and directly optimizes/searches sparse topology\
    \ within the pre-defined architecture.   In this paper, we propose Efficient to\
    \ Efficient Network (E2ENet), a model that can efficiently incorporate both bottom-up\
    \ and top-down information flows from the backbone network in a dynamic sparse\
    \ pattern, achieving a much better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. As shown in\
    \ Figure 1 (e), E2ENet incorporates multi-scale features from the backbone into\
    \ the final output by gradually fusing the adjacent features, allowing the\n\n\
