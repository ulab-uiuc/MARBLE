    clouds, particularly focusing on their morphology and evolution. My recent work
    involves analyzing filamentary molecular clouds using data from the Milky Way
    Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. By examining a significant area of the
    Milky Way, I have investigated the orientation and morphological asymmetry of
    these filaments, employing elliptical fitting techniques to achieve precise measurements.


    One of my key findings is the bimodal distribution of filament orientations relative
    to the Galactic plane, revealing intriguing patterns that deepen our understanding
    of their formation processes. Despite exploring various parameters, I found no
    significant correlations with orientation, which raises further questions about
    the underlying mechanisms at play. Notably, my research highlights that over 40%
    of the filaments exhibit head-tail asymmetry, indicating a tendency for mass concentration
    at one end, a phenomenon that could have implications for star formation and cloud
    dynamics.


    Through my work, I aim to contribute to the broader understanding of molecular
    clouds and their role in the Galactic ecosystem, paving the way for future studies

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing societal issues through
    advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of hate speech
    detection, wildlife trafficking, and human activity recognition. My recent work
    focuses on developing robust frameworks that not only enhance the accuracy of
    hate speech classification but also ensure fairness and resilience against adversarial
    attacks. For instance, I designed a novel hate speech detection framework, SWE2,
    which leverages both word-level semantics and sub-word knowledge, achieving impressive
    performance metrics even under extreme adversarial conditions.


    In addition to hate speech detection, I have tackled the challenge of wildlife
    trafficking by creating a scalable dataset and a practical framework for identifying
    suspicious online behaviors related to wildlife product sales. This work is crucial
    in combating illegal activities that threaten biodiversity.


    My research also delves into the complexities of human activity recognition, where
    I developed the Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning (DHC-HGL)
    framework. This innovative approach captures the nuances of context-aware data,
    significantly outperforming existing models.


    I am passionate about making my research accessible and reproducible, sharing
    code and datasets to foster collaboration and further exploration in these critical
    areas. My goal is to leverage machine learning to create impactful solutions that

    detect Covid-19 even before symptoms manifest. This innovative approach achieved
    an AUC-ROC of 0.79, demonstrating the potential of biobehavioral rhythms in timely
    disease detection.


    In addition to my work on Covid-19 detection, I have focused on improving energy

    a masking kernel into the training process, I successfully minimized energy consumption
    during both data acquisition and inference by 57%, making strides in sustainable
    AI applications.

    a novel Heterogeneous HyperGraph Neural Network (HHGNN-CHAR), which leverages
    the underlying graph structure of activity data. This work has led to substantial
    improvements in performance metrics, showcasing the power of graph representation

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nTo alleviate information\
    \ overload on the web, recommender system\nhas been widely deployed to perform\
    \ personalized information\nfiltering [ 7,45,46]. The core of recommender system\
    \ is to predict\nwhether a user will interact with an item, e.g., click, rate,\
    \ purchase,\namong other forms of interactions. As such, collaborative filtering\n\
    (CF), which focuses on exploiting the past user-item interactions to\nachieve\
    \ the prediction, remains to be a fundamental task towards\neffective personalized\
    \ recommendation [10, 19, 28, 39].\nThe most common paradigm for CF is to learn\
    \ latent features\n(a.k.a. embedding) to represent a user and an item, and perform\n\
    prediction based on the embedding vectors [ 6,19]. Matrix\nfactorization is an\
    \ early such model, which directly projects the\nsingle ID of a user to her embedding\
    \ [ 26]. Later on, several research\nfind that augmenting user ID with the her\
    \ interaction history as\nthe input can improve the quality of embedding. For\
    \ example,\nSVD++ [ 25] demonstrates the benefits of user interaction history\n\
    in predicting user numerical ratings, and Neural Attentive Item\nSimilarity (NAIS)\
    \ [ 18] differentiates the importance of items in\nthe interaction history and\
    \ shows improvements in predicting\nitem ranking. In view of user-item interaction\
    \ graph, these\nimprovements can be seen as coming from using the subgraph\nstructure\
    \ of a user \u2014 more specifically, her one-hop neighbors \u2014 to\nimprove\
    \ the embedding learning.\nTo deepen the use of subgraph structure with high-hop\n\
    neighbors, Wang et al. [ 39] recently proposes NGCF and achieves\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ performance for CF. It takes inspiration from the\nGraph Convolution Network\
    \ (GCN) [ 14,23], following the samearXiv:2002.02126v4  [cs.IR]  7 Jul 2020propagation\
    \ rule to refine embeddings: feature transformation,\nneighborhood aggregation,\
    \ and nonlinear activation. Although\nNGCF has shown promising results of the\
    \ 3-layer LightGCN. We have the following\nobservations:\n\u2022The best setting\
    \ in general is using sqrt normalization at both\nsides (i.e., the current design\
    \ of LightGCN). Removing either side\nwill drop the performance largely.\n\u2022\
    The second best setting is using L1normalization at the left side\nonly (i.e.,\
    \ LightGCN- L1-L). This is equivalent to normalize the\nadjacency matrix as a\
    \ stochastic matrix by the in-degree.\n\u2022Normalizing symmetrically on two\
    \ sides is helpful for the\nsqrt normalization, but will degrade the performance\
    \ of L1\nnormalization.\n4.4.3 Analysis of Embedding Smoothness. As we have analyzed\n\
    in Section 3.2.3, a 2-layer LightGCN smooths a user\u2019s embedding\nbased on\
    \ the users that have overlap on her interacted items, and\nthe smoothing strength\
    \ between two users cv\u2192uis measured in\nEquation (14). We speculate that\
    \ such smoothing of embeddings is\nthe key reason of LightGCN\u2019s effectiveness.\
    \ To verify this, we first\ndefine the smoothness of user embeddings as:\nSU=MX\n\
    u=1MX\nv=1cv\u2192u(eu\n||eu||2\u2212ev\n||ev||2)2, (17)\nwhere the L2norm on\
    \ embeddings is used to eliminate the\nimpact of the embedding\u2019s scale. Similarly\
    \ we can obtained the\ndefinition for item embeddings. Table 6 shows the smoothness\n\
    of two models, matrix factorization (i.e., using the E(0)for model\nprediction)\
    \ and the 2-layer LightGCN-single (i.e., using the E(2)for\nprediction). Note\
    \ that the 2-layer LightGCN-single outperforms\nMF in recommendation accuracy\
    \ by a large margin. As can be\nseen, the smoothness loss of LightGCN-single is\
    \ much lower\nthan that of MF. This indicates that by conducting light graph\n\
    convolution, the embeddings become smoother and more suitable\nfor recommendation.01e-6\
