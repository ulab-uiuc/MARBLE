  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years,\
    \ access to molecular forces has become an essential aspect in various applications\
    \ such as geometry optimization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\_(Jensen,\
    \ 2010).\nHowever, the underlying quantum mechanical (QM) calculations required\
    \ for these predictions are computationally demanding.\nIn order to reduce this\
    \ computational burden, graph neural networks (GNNs) fitted to QM data have been\
    \ proposed as a means to accelerate MD simulations\_(Chmiela et\_al., 2017; Sch\xFC\
    tt et\_al., 2018).\nWhile such surrogates have recently achieved exceptional reproduction\
    \ of the dataset they have been trained on, they tend to perform poorly on out-of-distribution\
    \ (OOD) data (Li et\_al., 2022). In practical applications, having access to the\
    \ full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example,\
    \ in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively\
    \ applies molecular forces\_(Hoja et\_al., 2021). These simulations may cause\
    \ the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019\
    s predictions unreliable\_(Stocker et\_al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE)\
    \ is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context\
    \ of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of\
    \ requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into\
    \ \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\n\
    In a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on\
    \ these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely\
    \ satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel\
    \ (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields\
    \ that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming\
    \ the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium\
    \ detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms\
    \ of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\_(Gal & Ghahramani,\
    \ 2016; Soleimany et\_al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find\
    \ our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive\
    \ physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular\
    \ force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata\
    \ and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\
    \n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension\
    \ to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\
