  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nLarge Language\
    \ Models (LLMs), built upon auto-regressive transformer\_(Vaswani et\_al., 2017;\
    \ OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et\_al., 2022; Touvron et\_al., 2023), have demonstrated\
    \ dominance in natural language generation due to the incredible context modeling\
    \ and scalability. Inspired by this, emergent works introduce auto-regressive\
    \ models into visual generation\_(Van Den\_Oord et\_al., 2017; Esser et\_al.,\
    \ 2021; Yu et\_al., 2022; Lee et\_al., 2022; Sun et\_al., 2024). These approaches\
    \ first utilize a vector quantizer for image tokenization and de-tokenization,\
    \ then employ an auto-regressive transformer for discrete image token sequence\
    \ modeling.\n\n\nAlthough great processes are achieved, the quality of visual\
    \ generation still falls behind the diffusion-based methods. The main factor is\
    \ limited tokenizer performance. Tokenizers are generally posited as the upper\
    \ bound of the visual generation, and inferior off-the-shelf tokenizers (e.g.,\
    \ VQ-VAE\_(Van Den\_Oord et\_al., 2017)) will lead to poor generation quality.\
    \ Although some improvements are done\_(Yu et\_al., 2022; Lee et\_al., 2022; Sun\
    \ et\_al., 2024), current tokenizers are limited by the codebook size and utilization,\
    \ and the reconstruction performance is still far worse than VAE(Kingma, 2013;\
    \ Rombach et\_al., 2022b) used in diffusion models. To unlock the potential of\
    \ tokenizers, MAGVIT-v2\_(Yu et\_al., 2024a) proposes Lookup-Free Quantizer to\
    \ enable a highly code-activated and super-large codebook, and achieves better\
    \ generation quality than diffusion models. However, such a powerful visual tokenizer\
    \ is completely closed-source and we have no access to this so far, limiting the\
    \ development of the academic community.\n\n\nIn this work, we push forward the\
    \ auto-regressive visual generation in two folds: 1) Replication of the visual\
    \ tokenizer: We re-implement the advanced Lookup-Free Quantizer proposed by MAGVIT-v2.\
    \ To our best knowledge, our open-source replication achieves the closest reconstruction\
    \ performance stated in MAGVIT-v2 (1.18 vs. 1.15 rFID on ImageNet 128\xD7\\times\xD7\
    128) and outperforms all other methods on the hallmark Imagenet benchmark\_(Deng\
    \ et\_al., 2009). 2) Integrating a super-large codebook with AR visual generation:\
    \ Instead of simply following MAGVIT-v2 that leverages the vision-oriented design\
    \ (i.e., mask generative methods\_(Chang et\_al., 2022) for visual synthesis),\
    \ we seek to exploit the potential of such a large codebook in vanilla auto-regressive\
    \ generation. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large\
    \ vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric\
    \ token factorization, and further introduce \u201Cnext sub-token prediction\u201D\
    \ to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. Our experiments\
    \ on the standard visual generation dataset ImageNet suggest that, with the powerful\
    \ tokenizer, the plain auto-regressive model exhibits superiority and scalability.\n\
    \n\nTable 1: Model configurations of Open-MAGVIT2. We partially follow the scaling\
    \ rule proposed in the previous works\_(Sun et\_al., 2024; Tian et\_al., 2024).\n\

    \n2.1 Overview\n\nOpen-MAGVIT2 is composed of two significant stages. One is a\
    \ powerful visual tokenizer that maps the input visual signal into the discrete\
    \ token representations. Subsequently, the vector-quantized sequence will be fed\
    \ into the auto-regressive transformer for intra- and inter-token relationship\
    \ modeling, eventually for visual synthesis.\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of Open-MAGVIT2.\
    \ There are two crucial stages in Open-MAGVIT2. In Stage II\\mathrm{I}roman_I:\
    \ the image is first encoded by MAGVIT-v2 Encoder and subsequently transformed\
    \ into bits format by Lookup-Free Quantizer (LFQ). In Stage IIII\\mathrm{II}roman_II:\
