    these groups. I have also explored the concept of perfect codes in finite groups,
    establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for subgroup perfect codes and
    applying these results to various group classes, including projective special
    linear groups.


    Additionally, I have investigated the application of Vision Transformers in drone
    detection, demonstrating their superiority over traditional CNN models in specific
    scenarios. My work emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying structures
    of both mathematical groups and machine learning models, aiming to bridge the

    \ become an important part of daily life, serving as tools\nfor individuals to\

    \ [cs.CV]  8 Apr 20242 K. You et al.\nFig.1:Ferret-UI is able to perform referring\
    \ tasks (e.g., widget classification, icon\nrecognition, OCR) with flexible input\
    \ formats (point, box, scribble) and grounding\ntasks (e.g., find widget, find\
    \ icon, find text, widget listing) on mobile UI screens. These\nelementary tasks\
    \ equip the model with rich visual and spatial knowledge, enabling it to\ndistinguish\
    \ UI types at both coarse and fine levels, such as between various icons or text\n\
    elements. This foundational knowledge is crucial for performing more advanced\
    \ tasks.\nSpecifically, Ferret-UI is able to not only discuss visual elements\
    \ in detailed descrip-\ntionandperception conversation , but also propose goal-oriented\
    \ actions in interaction\nconversation and deduce the overall function of the\
    \ screen via function inference .\ncurrent screen visually, and perform the desired\

    \ perception and interaction within user\ninterfaces, a sophisticated system endowed\
    \ with a set of key capabilities is es-\nsential. Such a system must possess the\

    \ it should further be able\nto map natural language instructions to corresponding\
    \ actions within a given\nUI, execute advanced reasoning, and provide exhaustive\
    \ details concerning the\nscreens it interacts with. These requirements necessitate\
    \ the development of a\nvision-language model adept at both referring and grounding\
    \ in relation to UI\nscreens. Here, referring requires the system to utilize particular\
    \ regional image\ninformation in the screen input, while grounding involves the\
    \ model\u2019s capacity\nto identify and denote precise locations on the screen\
    \ in its outputs.\nExisting approaches are insufficient in fully addressing these\
    \ key capabilities.\nOn one hand, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\
    \ like Fer-\nret[53],Shikra[8],andKosmos2[41]demonstratestrongreferringandgrounding\n\
    capabilities, their scope is mainly restricted to natural images. Directly adapting\n\

    \ than natural images. Relying solely on a directly resized, low-resolution\n\
    global image could lead to loss of important visual signals that are essential\
    \ for\nscreen understanding and interaction. On the other hand, other works targeting\n\
    directly at UI tasks have primarily focused on processing entire screens as sin-\n\
    gular inputs ( e.g., Pix2Struct [27], ILuvUI [23], CogAgent [20]), only supports\n\
    referring tasks with one bounding box in the input ( e.g., Spotlight [30]), and\n\
    leveraging GPT-4V [51] to navigate UI screens, as seen in MM-Navigator [49],\n\
    AppAgent [55], and MobileAgent [47]. Furthermore, the tasks studied in these\n\
    work do not comprehensively cover all dimensions of UI screen understanding.\n\
    In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, the first MLLM designed to execute\nprecise\
    \ referring and grounding tasks specific to UI screens, while adeptly in-\nterpreting\
    \ and acting upon open-ended language instructions. We address the\naforementioned\
    \ limitations by focusing on three pivotal dimensions: ( i) improved\nmodel architecture,\
    \ ( ii) data curation, and ( iii) benchmark establishment. For\nmodel architecture,\
