  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and understanding
    of machine learning models, particularly in the realms of federated learning and
    vision-language models. My recent work has led to the development of FedPara,
    a communication-efficient parameterization for federated learning that significantly
    reduces model upload and download burdens while maintaining performance. This
    innovation not only streamlines communication costs but also extends to personalized
    federated learning through pFedPara, which optimizes parameter management for
    better adaptability.


    In addition to federated learning, I have delved into the intricacies of vision-language
    models (VLMs). I introduced a novel eye examination process to assess how VLMs
    perceive images, revealing critical insights into their sensitivities to color,
    shape, and semantic recognition. This work, supported by the LENS dataset, aims
    to inform the design of VLMs and enhance their performance in real-world applications.


    Furthermore, I have explored the role of attention mechanisms in Vision Transformers
    (ViTs). My research on Context Broadcasting (CB) has shown that enhancing spatial
    interactions through uniform attention can improve model capacity and generalizability
    without incurring significant computational costs. Through these contributions,
    I strive to push the boundaries of machine learning, making models more efficient
    and interpretable while addressing real-world challenges.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the capabilities and trustworthiness
    of vision-language models (VLMs) and addressing challenges in visual perception
    and data imbalance. My recent work focuses on understanding and mitigating hallucination
    in VLMs, where I developed the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF) and introduced
    novel metrics to evaluate VLM performance in real-world scenarios. This research
    aims to improve the reliability of VLM outputs, enabling users to trust the results
    more fully.


    In addition to VLMs, I have explored weakly-supervised low-shot instance segmentation
    through my method, ENInst, which enhances model performance by refining instance
    masks and improving classification accuracy. This approach demonstrates significant
    efficiency gains compared to fully-supervised models.


    I also proposed TextManiA, a text-driven manifold augmentation technique that
    enriches visual feature spaces by leveraging the semantic power of language models.
    This work highlights the potential of language encoders to enhance visual representation,
    particularly in scenarios with scarce or imbalanced data.


    Lastly, I have investigated the use of synthetic data to combat data imbalance
    issues in training datasets. My method, SYNAuG, shows that combining synthetic
    data with real samples can lead to impressive performance improvements across
    various tasks. Through these contributions, I aim to push the boundaries of how
    we understand and utilize VLMs and machine learning models in general.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of cryptography, machine
    learning, and blockchain technology. My recent work focuses on addressing critical
    challenges in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and vision-language models (VLMs).
    I developed Cheddar, an FHE library optimized for CUDA GPUs, which significantly
    enhances performance for encrypted data processing, achieving up to 25.6 times
    faster execution compared to previous implementations.


    In the realm of VLMs, I have explored their vulnerabilities, particularly the
    issue of hallucination, by creating the BEAF dataset and introducing new metrics
    to assess their understanding of visual scenes. My research also delves into mitigating
    data imbalance in training datasets through synthetic data generation with SYNAuG,
    demonstrating its effectiveness across various tasks.


    Additionally, I have investigated the visual perception capabilities of VLMs through
    a novel eye examination process, revealing insights into their sensitivities to
    color, shape, and semantic recognition. My work extends to blockchain technology,
    where I proposed a decentralized system for compliance with the Financial Action
    Task Force''s travel rule, ensuring secure data exchange.


    Through empirical analysis of over 592 cryptocurrency projects, I have highlighted
    the challenges of code maintenance and security vulnerabilities, providing a critical
    perspective on the cryptocurrency landscape. My research aims to bridge theoretical
    advancements with practical applications, ultimately enhancing the reliability
    and security of emerging technologies.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance
    in tasks like link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. Additionally, I proposed the ROLAND framework, which enables the adaptation
    of static GNNs to dynamic graphs, addressing the challenges posed by evolving
    data structures.


    My research extends beyond GNNs; I have investigated the relationship between
    neural network architectures and their predictive performance through a novel
    relational graph representation. This work has opened new avenues for designing
    more effective neural architectures.


    I am passionate about systematically exploring the design space of GNNs, leading
    to the development of tools like GraphGym, which facilitates the exploration of
    different GNN designs and tasks. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical
    advancements and practical applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution
    of machine learning methodologies.'

    Overall, my research is driven by a passion for understanding and improving the
