  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing robotic capabilities, particularly
    in the areas of tool manipulation, adaptive control, and dynamic interaction with
    flexible objects. My work focuses on optimizing robotic tool shapes and trajectories
    to enhance task performance, as demonstrated in my studies on robotic object manipulation
    and laparoscopic surgery. I have developed innovative methods such as the Deep
    Predictive Model with Parametric Bias (DPMPB) to address complex modeling challenges
    and temporal changes in robotic systems.


    My research also explores the integration of imitation learning and visual servoing,
    enabling robots to adaptively learn from human demonstrations and autonomously
    adjust to their environments. I have implemented these concepts in various robotic
    platforms, including musculoskeletal humanoids and low-rigidity robots, to achieve
    complex behaviors like seated walking and dynamic manipulation of flexible materials.


    Additionally, I am passionate about creating versatile robotic systems that can
    operate in diverse environments, from industrial settings to personal assistance.
    My work on modular robots and the Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model
    (GeMuCo) reflects my commitment to developing robots that can learn and adapt
    their body schemas based on real-time experiences.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between human-like adaptability and
    robotic precision, ultimately contributing to the evolution of intelligent robotic
    systems capable of performing intricate tasks in dynamic and unpredictable environments.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing robotic state recognition and
    interaction through innovative applications of vision-language models. My recent
    work focuses on leveraging Visual Question Answering (VQA) within Pre-Trained
    Vision-Language Models (PTVLMs) to intuitively describe and recognize various
    states in robotic environments. By employing genetic algorithms to optimize question
    combinations, I have developed systems capable of recognizing complex states,
    such as the open/closed status of doors and the state of water, which have traditionally
    posed challenges.


    I have also explored the emotional dimensions of robotic interactions, creating
    a diary generation system that utilizes shared experiences between humans and
    robots to foster intimacy and improve user perception. My research extends to
    the integration of foundation models for executing General Purpose Service Robot
    (GPSR) tasks, where I successfully led a team to victory in the RoboCup@home Japan
    Open 2022.


    My work emphasizes the importance of continuous state recognition, particularly
    in dynamic environments like cooking, where I have proposed methods to track food
    state changes using vision-language models. I aim to bridge the gap between advanced
    vision-language models and practical robotic applications, ensuring that robots
    can navigate and operate effectively in diverse settings without extensive retraining
    or manual programming.

    the need for extensive retraining.


    My research also explores the challenges faced by low-rigidity robots in grasping
    and performing tasks like wiping and cooking. By implementing adaptive visual
    servoing techniques, I enable these robots to learn and adjust their movements
    in real-time, accommodating changes in their physical state. Additionally, I have
    investigated the potential of using large-scale vision-language models for continuous
    state recognition, allowing robots to monitor changes over time, such as the boiling
    of water or the melting of butter.


    I am particularly interested in simplifying robot navigation and task execution
    by employing open-vocabulary approaches that eliminate the need for prior map
    construction or complex programming. My work culminated in a successful implementation

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nDespite being a core\
    \ linguistic phenomenon, nega-\ntion remains a major stumbling block for modern\n\
    NLP architectures (Kassner and Sch\xFCtze, 2020;\nHossain et al., 2022). A reason\
    \ for this could be\nthat texts containing negation are underrepresented\nin training\
    \ data of language models, as humans tend\nto express themselves using affirmative\
    \ rather than\nnegative expressions (Ettinger, 2020). Regardless,\nnegation has\
    \ been shown to be challenging even for\nhumans to correctly interpret due to\
    \ the diversity of\nforms across domains (Truong et al., 2022a). For\ninstance,\
    \ in clinical documents, many acronyms\nare used to denote negation such as NAD\
    \ (no ab-\nnormality detected) , and implicit negation abounds,\nsuch as normal\
    \ chest x-ray scan , which implies the\nabsence of an abnormality. Even more complex\
    \ is\nthe use of negation in combination with other lin-\nguistic phenomena such\
    \ as quantifiers, gradable ad-\njectives ( not unattractive does not imply attractive\
    \ )\n\u2217Now at Google DeepMind.(Truong et al., 2022b); licensing context (negative\n\
    polarity items, e.g. any, either, yet , normally appear\nin certain negative grammatical\
    \ contexts Warstadt\net al. (2019)); downward entailment ( A man owns a\ndogentails\
    \ A man owns an animal butA man does\nnot own a dog does not entail A man does\
    \ not own\nan animal ) (Geiger et al., 2020).\nTraditionally, negation has been\
    \ treated as a stan-\ndalone problem, e.g. as negation detection (Chap-\nman et\
    \ al., 2001). The investigation of the im-\npact of negation in various downstream\
    \ tasks (Hos-\nsain et al., 2022; Hossain and Blanco, 2022a), or\nthrough probing\
    \ (Ettinger, 2020) has revealed sev-\neral limitations of modern large language\
    \ models\n(\u201CLLMs\u201D) in handling negation. Given that LLMs\nare being\
    \ adopted in an ever-growing range of tasks\nand have been shown to display emergent\
    \ abilities\nfor high-level tasks that require complex reasoning\n(Wei et al.,\
    \ 2022a), we are interested in exploring\nhow the handling of negation has progressed.\n\
    In this work, we investigate the performance\nof auto-regressive language models\
    \ on different\nnegation-focused benchmarks. Instead of just look-\ning at samples\
    \ containing negation in common\nNLP datasets, we consider datasets in which nega-\n\
    tion plays an important role in making the correct\njudgement. In particular,\
    \ we classify the bench-\nmarks into three categories corresponding to the\nrequisite\
    \ negation reasoning abilities: (1) sensitiv-\nity to negation through cloze completion\
    \ (fill-in-\nthe-blank) queries of factual statements; (2) lexi-\ncal semantics\
    \ of negation through classification of\nantonym/synonym relationships; and (3)\
    \ ability to\nreason with negation through language inference\ntasks.\nWe conduct\
    \ extensive experiments\nfor larger models like PaLM (with up to 540B pa-\nrameters)\
    \ (Chowdhery et al., 2022). Recent work\nby Wei et al. (2022b) has shown that\
    \ the inverse\nscaling trend on several benchmarks can be alle-\nviated using\
    \ the large instruction fine-tuned mod-\nels such as FLAN-PaLM-540B, which is\
    \ largely\nin line with our findings regarding InstructGPT\nand FLAN-T5. With\
    \ a small-scale experiment, we\nfound that ChatGPT displayed strong performanceon\
    \ challenging samples in the investigated bench-\nmark, so the main findings of\
    \ the paper may not\nhold true for newer LLMs.\nFinally, this work only considers\
    \ negation in the\nEnglish language. There is every reason to believe\nthat negation\
    \ is an equally challenging problem in\nother languages. As this is a linguistically-intensive\n\
    task, and requires native speakers to conduct thor-\nough analysis of the Appendix\
    \ B).\nFinding 1: Larger LMs are more insensitive to\nnegation\nMKR-NQ (Jang et\
    \ al., 2022b) Masked Knowl-\nedge Retrieval \u2013 Negated Query (MKR-NQ) is a\n\
