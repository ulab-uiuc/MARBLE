  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the exploration of quantum materials
    and their unique properties, particularly focusing on flat-band systems and their
    implications in superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling. My recent work investigates
    the quantum geometric effects on the Higgs mode in flat-band superconductors,
    revealing how the quantum metric influences third-harmonic generation (THG) and
    providing insights into detecting Higgs modes through optical methods.


    In addition to my work in condensed matter physics, I am also exploring the intersection
    of artificial intelligence and behavioral finance through the study of Large Vision-Language
    Models (LVLMs). I have developed a framework to assess the reasoning capabilities
    of these models, particularly in relation to behavioral biases such as recency
    and authority bias. My findings highlight significant biases in open-source LVLMs,
    offering pathways for improvement.


    Furthermore, I have proposed a novel model for unconventional Rashba bands, demonstrating
    their enhanced spin galvanic effects compared to conventional bands. This research
    opens new avenues for understanding spin dynamics in two-dimensional systems.


    Lastly, I am innovating in the field of spectrum sensing with one-bit analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs), leveraging the eigenvalue moment ratio for efficient signal
    sampling. My work emphasizes low-cost, high-performance solutions in spectrum
    sensing, showcasing the potential of one-bit technologies in practical applications.
    Overall, my research spans a diverse range of topics, all aimed at uncovering
    the intricate relationships between quantum mechanics, materials science, and
    machine learning.'

    psychology. I have developed a comprehensive framework that spans data collection
    to innovative evaluation metrics, allowing for a nuanced assessment of LVLMs''
    reasoning capabilities and their susceptibility to biases such as recency bias
    and authority bias.


    In my evaluations, I have analyzed several prominent open-source LVLMs, including
    LLaVA-NeXT and MobileVLM-V2, revealing significant behavioral biases that can
    impact their performance in real-world applications. In contrast, I found that
    proprietary models like GPT-4o exhibit minimal bias, underscoring the need for
    improvements in open-source models. My research not only highlights critical areas
    for enhancement but also aims to foster a deeper understanding of how these advanced
    models can be responsibly utilized in various domains. I am passionate about contributing
    to the development of more robust and fair AI systems, and I actively share my
    findings and code to encourage collaboration and further research in this vital
    area.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities during the aggregation
    process.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the
    ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic
    environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML),
    where I introduced methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer to improve the efficiency
    of model design searches by leveraging prior knowledge across tasks.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    providing scalable solutions that push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve
    in real-world scenarios. I am passionate about continuing to explore this dynamic
    field and contributing to its evolution.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nGood benchmarks guide\
    \ AI development. Current large foundational models such as GPT-\n4 [59], Gemini\
    \ [ 69], Claude [ 2], and many others [ 71,60,57,14] have demonstrated transformative\n\
    capabilities, approaching or surpassing human-level performances in many tasks.\
    \ In this context,\nbenchmarks become both challenging and crucial to differentiate\
    \ among the models and detect their\nweaknesses.\nIn the field of language models,\
    \ exemplary works such as [ 38,68,19] aimed to comprehensively\nassess models\
    \ across a wide range of dimensions. As generative AI evolves from language-centric\
    \ to\nmultimodal, a unified evaluation framework and a closer look at existing\
    \ benchmarks are needed.\nTransparent, standardized, and reproducible evaluations\
    \ are crucial. We identify that there is\nso far no unified evaluation protocol\
    \ in the field of LMM. Model publishers [ 42,71,16,87,33]\ncome up with custom\
    \ evaluation pipelines, which often differ significantly in data preparation,\
    \ output\npostprocessing, and metrics calculation, hindering transparency and\
    \ reproducibility. To this end, we\nbuild a standardized and reliable benchmark\
    \ suite to assess multimodal models in their entirety with\n*Equal contribution.BCorresponding\

    LIVE.-JWF#FODIFigure 1: To best navigate the trilemma in LMM evaluation benchmarking,\
    \ we contribute (1)LMM S-\nEVAL: a unified and standardized multimodal benchmark\
    \ suite that encompasses over 50 tasks and\nmore than 10 models, ensuring wide\
    \ coverage; (2)LMM S-EVAL LITE: an efficient benchmark set\nwith reliable and\
    \ aligned results categorized into Basic\nUnderstanding and Comparative Analysis.\
    \ Each category presents a question related to an article and\nthe corresponding\
    \ ground-truth answer.\n25 Appendix I.1.\nWe begin by capturing screenshots of\
    \ home pages and then refine these images by removing white\nmargins and other\
    \ non-news elements to ensure the content focuses on news information, not\nadvertisements\
    \ or errors due to website blocking. For analysis, we select a quiz model from\
    \ our pool of\ncurrent most powerful commercial multimodal models, such as GPT4-V\
    \ , Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-\n1.5-Pro. We then guide the quiz model to progressively\
    \ ask questions across multiple dimensions,\nincluding (1) basic understanding\
    \ (2) contextual analysis (3) deeper and broader implications (4)\nfurther insights.\
    \ The models design a Q&A set to address these dimensions. Subsequently, another\n\
    model from our pool reviews and revises the questions for accuracy and relevance.\n\
    The final Q&As are then reviewed by humans for ultimate validation. To balance\
    \ data collection\ncosts and user evaluation, we aim to gather about 500 questions\
    \ monthly, selecting 100-300 for our\nfinal L IVEBENCH problem set, tagged with\
    \ identifiers like LiveBench-2024-05 .\n4.2.2 Evaluation Metrics & experiments\
    \ to enhance our\nunderstanding of model architectures and training data.\n2.2\
    \ The Evaluation Trilemma\nOur ultimate goal is to find a wide-coverage, low-cost,\
    \ and zero-contamination way to evaluate LMMs.\nHowever, even with LMM S-EVAL,\
    \ we find it to be hard or even impossible. Specifically, once we\nscale the evaluation\
    \ datasets to 50+, it becomes time-consuming to perform a full evaluation run\
    \ on\nthose datasets. Besides, those benchmarks are also susceptible to contamination\
    \ during the training\n3time[ 79]. As shown in Figure 1, we believe there is a\
    \ trilemma in model evaluation. One can not\nachieve the three goals simultaneously\
    \ but only find a trade-off. The LMSys Chatbot Arena [ 13]and\nAI2 WildVision\
    \ [ 50] are foundational works in stressing wide coverage and anti-contamination.\
    \ We\npresent our solution to balance the other two sides of the triangle in Section\
    \ 3 and Section\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
