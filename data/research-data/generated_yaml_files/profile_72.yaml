  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing pressing societal issues through
    advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of hate speech
    detection, wildlife trafficking, and human activity recognition. My recent work
    focuses on developing robust frameworks that not only enhance detection accuracy
    but also ensure fairness and resilience against adversarial attacks. For instance,
    I designed a novel hate speech detection framework that leverages Bidirectional
    Quaternion-Quasi-LSTM layers, achieving significant performance improvements over
    existing methods.


    In addition to hate speech, I have tackled the challenge of detecting wildlife
    trafficking behaviors in online social networks. By creating a scalable dataset
    and employing a human-in-the-loop machine learning process, I developed a practical
    framework that identifies suspicious wildlife selling posts, contributing to efforts
    in combating environmental crimes.


    My research also delves into the complexities of human activity recognition, where
    I introduced a Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning framework.
    This innovative approach captures the nuances of context-aware data, significantly
    outperforming state-of-the-art models.


    I am passionate about making my work accessible to the research community, sharing
    code and datasets to foster collaboration and further exploration. My goal is
    to leverage machine learning to create impactful solutions that address real-world
    challenges, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to understanding and mitigating the impact
    of misinformation and hate speech in online environments. My work spans various
    domains, including crowdfunding, social media analysis, and automated fact-checking
    systems. I have conducted extensive studies on the characteristics of on-time
    and late reward delivery in crowdfunding projects, revealing key factors that
    influence project success.


    In the realm of misinformation, I have developed innovative models such as the
    Hierarchical Multi-head Attentive Network for fact-checking and a novel fact-checking
    URL recommendation system to enhance user engagement in combating fake news. My
    research also delves into the dynamics of public health crises, analyzing social
    media responses during outbreaks like Ebola to inform future health communication
    strategies.


    I am particularly passionate about creating robust frameworks for hate speech
    detection, exemplified by my SWE2 model, which effectively identifies hate speech
    while maintaining resilience against adversarial attacks. Additionally, I have
    explored the potential of large language models for data augmentation, demonstrating
    their ability to enhance performance across various tasks.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and social responsibility,
    providing tools and insights that empower users to navigate the complexities of
    information in the digital age. My research not only contributes to academic knowledge
    but also has practical implications for improving online discourse and fostering
    a more informed society.'
