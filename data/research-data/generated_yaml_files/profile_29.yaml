  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the intersection of machine learning
    and healthcare, with a particular focus on privacy-preserving technologies and
    decision support systems. My recent work has centered on developing frameworks
    that ensure patient data privacy while enabling effective clinical decision-making.
    For instance, I pioneered a local differential privacy approach for learning population
    rulesets in clinical decision support systems, utilizing Monte-Carlo Tree Search
    to balance privacy and utility.


    I have also explored safety assurance in machine learning for medical cyber-physical
    systems, specifically in artificial pancreas systems, where I implemented deep
    learning models and formal verification techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
    My research on hemodynamic risk stratification led to the creation of CARNA, a
    framework that integrates invasive hemodynamics and interpretable machine learning
    to improve heart failure risk assessments.


    Additionally, I have investigated Type I Diabetes management through a Signal
    Temporal Logic-based learning approach, identifying behavioral patterns that influence
    glycemic control. My work on causal discovery in time series data culminated in
    the development of MotifDisco, a framework that uncovers causal relationships
    among motifs in glucose traces, enhancing our understanding of patient behaviors.


    Most recently, I introduced GlucoSynth, a privacy-preserving GAN framework for
    generating synthetic glucose traces, which maintains the integrity of the data
    while ensuring strong privacy guarantees. My research aims to empower healthcare
    providers with robust, interpretable tools that enhance patient care while safeguarding
    sensitive information.'
