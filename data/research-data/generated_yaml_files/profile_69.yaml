  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             introduction of pairwise\nsuppressible\
    \ random, arti\uFB01cial noises. These noises are used to\nobfuscate private local\
    \ model parameters and thwart external\neavesdroppers. This design can be seen\
    \ as an integration of\nDP and secure aggregation at the physical layer for OTA-FL.\n\
    In addition, Yan et al. [78] propose a secure and private OTA-\nFL framework,\
    \ which utilizes noise to preserve privacy and\nsecurity guarantees. The framework\
    \ employs DP and MSE-\nsecurity as the metrics. Speci\uFB01cally, a subset of\
    \ devices is\ndesignated to send Gaussian arti\uFB01cial noise with the aim of\n\
    degrading the SNR of potential eavesdroppers. To mitigate the\nimpact of noise\
    \ on learning accuracy, a channel-weighted post-\nprocessing mechanism is introduced.\
    \ Moreover, the authorspropose a scheduling algorithm based on the branch-and-\n\
    bound concept with low complexity. This algorithm ensures\nthe security of the\
    \ system and the privacy of user data stored\non the server.\nVI. L ESSONS LEARNED\
    \ , OPEN CHALLENGES ,AND\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nAs OTA-FL in wireless environments\
    \ continues to gain\nattention, researchers are actively working to tackle the\
    \ asso-\nciated challenges and improve system performance. However,\nthere are\
    \ still several open questions and directions for further\nresearch in this area.\
    \ Some of these challenging questions are\ndiscussed in the following.\nA. Aggregation\
    \ Distortion\nOTA-FL systems face the challenge of distortion introduced\nby channel\
    \ fading, noise, and transceiver \uFB01ltering, which can\ndegrade the quality\
    \ of the received summation signal [87],\n[88]. Minimizing this distortion has\
    \ been a persistent challenge\nin OTA-FL. Coded OTA can help reduce distortion\
    \ but adds\ncomplexity to the system with coding and decoding pro-\ncesses. On\
    \ the other hand, uncoded OTA requires an advanced\ntransceiver design to achieve\
    \ optimal amplitude alignment and\ncombat interference. Both approaches necessitate\
    \ improved\ndesign techniques to enhance the training performance of\nOTA-FL systems.\n\
    B. Stringent Synchronization Requirement\nThe assumption of perfect signal synchronization\
    \ at the\nreceiving end has been commonly made in most existing\nOTA-FL studies\
    \ [26]. However, this assumption becomes\nincreasingly challenging to achieve\
    \ in scenarios with large\nsystem sizes and high heterogeneity. While some efforts\
    \ have\nbeen made to address this challenge through robust design\ntechniques,\
    \ such as those proposed in [89], effectively im-\nplementing synchronization\
    \ in complex network environments\nremains an important and unresolved area that\
    \ requires further\ninvestigation. Overcoming the synchronization challenge is\n\
    crucial to ensure the reliable and ef\uFB01cient operation of OTA-\nFL in real-world\
    \ wireless systems.\nC. Data Heterogeneity\nIn different OTA-FL scenarios, user\
    \ data often have different\ndistributions. It is necessary to consider different,\
    \ non-I.I.D.\nsettings when testing the performance of different algorithms\n\
    to ensure a robust design. For example, the authors of [90]\nde\uFB01ne several\
    \ non-I.I.D. distribution policies to serve as\nbenchmarks. Meanwhile, the severely\
    \ unbalanced distribution\nof data often leads to the gradient importance of different\n\
    users, which makes some users\u2019 updates submerged in receiver\nnoises. To\
    \ this end, an adequate design of aggregation weights\nunder non-I.I.D. distributions\
    \ is a vital direction in the future.\nAs a matter of fact, OTA-FL is particularly\
    \ susceptible to\nunbalanced volumes of training data among different users.\n\
    This is because local models trained based on signi\uFB01cantly\nlarger amounts\
    \ of local data are typically weighted higher. In12\nthe context of OTA-FL, this\
    \ means the local models would be\ndelivered with much higher received powers\
    \ at the server (or\nBS). A near-far effect could occur, leading to the loss of\
    \ local\nmodes trained based on smaller amounts of data and delivered\nwith lower\
    \ transmit powers.\nD. Secure and Trustworthy OTA-FL\nWhile efforts have been\
    \ made to protect user\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
