  profile: 'As a researcher in the emerging field of Surgical Data Science, I am dedicated
    to enhancing the quality and value of interventional healthcare through the effective
    capture, organization, analysis, and modeling of complex data. My work began with
    the organization of an international workshop that brought together leading experts
    in computer and robot-assisted interventions. This collaborative effort led to
    a consensus definition of Surgical Data Science and highlighted the challenges
    and opportunities within the field.


    I am particularly focused on the intersection of data science and machine learning
    techniques in improving decision-making and quality improvement in surgical practices.
    My research emphasizes the importance of rigorous validation in biomedical image
    analysis, where I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing challenges.
    I advocate for best practice guidelines to enhance reproducibility and interpretation
    of results, addressing critical issues that can impact the scientific community.


    Through my work, I aim to pave the way for a new generation of analytics in interventional
    medicine, fostering collaboration and innovation to tackle the complexities of
    surgical data. I believe that by harnessing the power of data, we can significantly
    improve patient outcomes and advance the field of surgical science.'
