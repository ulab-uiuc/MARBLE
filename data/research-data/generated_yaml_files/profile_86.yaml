    models and their applications in real-world scenarios. My recent work focuses
    on tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) and their interaction with external

    training instructions and the more natural, user-centric instructions found in
    practice. This led to the creation of ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning
    framework that significantly improves task completion and instruction-following

  profile: 'As a researcher dedicated to enhancing the field of session-based recommendation
    (SR), my work primarily focuses on bridging the gap between model accuracy and
    explainability. I recognize that while many SR models excel in predictive performance,
    they often fall short in providing clear, interpretable insights into their recommendations.
    To address this, I developed a novel framework called PR4SR, which leverages path
    reasoning through a generalized hierarchical reinforcement learning approach.


    In PR4SR, I designed a dual-agent system that intelligently selects items based
    on their significance within a session and performs path reasoning to generate

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction:\nI recently had the pleasure\
    \ of visiting the beautiful Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, and I must say, it was an\
    \ unforgettable\nexperience. The crystal blue waters, the lively atmosphere, and\
    \ the stunning cityscape in the results demonstrated by LLaV A-1.5,\nseveral limitations\
    \ must be acknowledged. First, LLaV A-\n1.5 utilizes full image patches, potentially\
    \ prolonging each\ntraining iteration. While visual resamplers [ 3,14,32] re-\n\
    duce the number of visual patches in LLMs, they currently\ncannot achieve convergence\
    \ as efficiently as LLaV A with a\ncomparable amount of training data, probably\
    \ due to more\ntrainable parameters in the resamplers. The developmentof a sample-efficient\
    \ visual resampler could pave the way\nfor future scaling-up of instruction-following\
    \ multimodal\nmodels. Second, LLaV A-1.5 is not yet capable of processing\nmultiple\
    \ images due to the lack of such instruction-following\ndata, and the limit of\
    \ the context length. Third, although\nLLaV A-1.5 exhibits proficiency in following\
    \ complex in-\nstructions, its problem-solving capabilities can still be lim-\n\
    ited in certain domains, which could be improved with a\nmore capable language\
    \ model and with high-quality, tar-\ngeted visual instruction tuning data. Finally,\
    \ despite its sig-\nnificantly reduced propensity for hallucination, LLaV A-1.5\n\
    is not exempt from producing hallucinations and occasion-\nally disseminating\
    \ misinformation, and should be used with\ncaution in critical applications (\
    \ e.g. medical). Related Work\nInstruction-following large multimodal models (LMMs).\n\
    Common architectures include a pre-trained visual backbone\nto encode visual features,\
    \ a pre-trained large language model\n(LLM) to comprehend the user instructions\
    \ and produce\nresponses, and a vision-language cross-modal connector\nto align\
    \ the vision encoder outputs to the language mod-\nels. As shown in Fig. 1, LLaV\
    \ A [ 36] is perhaps the sim-\nplest architecture for LMMs. Optionally, visual\
    \ resamplers\n(e.g. Qformer [ 32]) are used to reduce the number of vi-\nsual\
    \ patches [ 3,14,62]. Training an instruction-following\nLMM usually follows a\
    \ two-stage protocol. First, the vision-\nlanguage alignment pretraining stage\
    \ leverages image-text\npairs to align the visual features with the language model\u2019\
    s\nword embedding space. Earlier works utilize relatively few\nimage-text pairs\
    \ ( e.g.\u223C600K [ 36] or\u223C6M [ 62]), while some\nrecent works pretrain\
    \ the vision-language connector for a spe-\ncific language model on a large amount\
    \ of image-text pairs\n(e.g. 129M [ 14] and 1.4B [ 3]), to maximize the LMM\u2019\
    s per-\nformance. Second, the visual instruction tuning stage tunes\nthe model\
    \ on visual instructions [ 36], to enable the model to\nfollow users\u2019 diverse\
    \ requests on instructions that involve the\nvisual contents. Dealing with higher\
    \ resolution with grids in\nLMM are studied in con-current works [1, 28, 53].\n\
    Multimodal instruction-following data. In NLP, studies\nshow that the quality\
    \ of instruction-following data largely\naffects the capability of the resulting\
    \ instruction-following\nmodels [ 61]. For visual instruction tuning, LLaV A [\
    \ 36] is the\npioneer to leverage text-only GPT-4 to expand the existing\nCOCO\
    \ [ 35] bounding box and caption dataset to a multi-\nmodal instruction-following\
    \ dataset that contains three types\nof instruction-following data: conversational-style\
    \ QA, de-\ntailed description, and complex reasoning. LLaV A\u2019s pipeline\n\
    has been employed to expand to textual understanding [ 57],\nmillion-scales [\
    \ 58], and region-level conversations [ 8]. In-\nstructBLIP [ 14] incorporates\
    \ academic-task-oriented VQA\ndatasets to further enhance the model\u2019s visual\
    \ capabilities.\nConversely, [ 7] identifies that such naive data merging can\n\
    result in models that tend to overfit to VQA datasets and\nthus are unable to\
    \ participate in natural conversations. The\nauthors further propose to leverage\
    \ the LLaV A\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
