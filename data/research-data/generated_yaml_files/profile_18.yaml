  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1. Introduction\n\nThanks to recent\
    \ advancements in 3D reconstruction techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields\
    \ (NeRF) (Mildenhall et\_al., 2020), it is nowadays possible for creators to develop\
    \ a 3D asset or a scene from captured real-world data without intensive labor.\n\
    While such 3D reconstruction methods work well, editing an entire 3D scene to\
    \ match a desired style or concept is not straightforward.\n\n\nFor instance,\
    \ editing conventional 3D scenes based on explicit representations like mesh often\
    \ involves specialized tools and skills. Changing the appearance of the entire\
    \ mesh-based scene would often require skilled labor, such as shape modeling,\
    \ texture creation, and material parameter modifications.\n\n\nAt the advent of\
    \ implicit 3D representation techniques such as NeRF, style editing methods for\
    \ 3D are also emerging (Nguyen-Phuoc et\_al., 2022; Wang et\_al., 2023; Liu et\_\
    al., 2023; Kamata et\_al., 2023; Haque et\_al., 2023; Dong and Wang, 2024) to\
    \ enhance creators\u2019 content development process.\nFollowing the recent development\
    \ of 2D image generation models, prominent works such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (Haque\
    \ et\_al., 2023; Vachha and Haque, 2024) and ViCA-NeRF (Dong and Wang, 2024) proposed\
    \ to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models\
    \ to supervise the 3D NeRF editing process.\n\n\nThese methods employ a custom\
    \ pipeline based on an instruction-based T2I model \u201DInstruct-Pix2Pix\u201D\
    \ (Brooks et\_al., 2023) to stylize a 3D scene with text instructions. While Instruct-NeRF2NeRF\
    \ is proven to work well for editing 3D scenes including large-scale 360 environments,\
    \ their method involves an iterative process of editing and replacing the training\
    \ data during NeRF optimization, occasionally resulting in unpredictable results.\
    \ As editing by Instruct-Pix2Pix runs in tandem with NeRF training, we found adjusting\
    \ or testing editing styles beforehand difficult.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem,\
    \ we propose an artistic style-transfer method that trains a source 3D NeRF scene\
    \ on stylized images prepared in advance by a text-guided style-aligned diffusion\
    \ model. Training is guided by Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) loss (Heitz et\_\
    al., 2021; Li et\_al., 2022) to effectively perform 3D style transfer with NeRF.\n\
    A summary of our contributions is as the follows:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe propose\
    \ a novel 3D style-transfer approach for NeRF, including large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\
    \n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe show that a style-aligned diffusion model conditioned on depth\
    \ maps of corresponding source views can generate perceptually view-consistent\
    \ style images for fine-tuning the source NeRF. Users can test stylization ideas\
    \ with the diffusion pipeline before proceeding to the NeRF fine-tuning phase.\n\
    \n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe find that fine-tuning the source NeRF with SWD loss can perform\
    \ 3D style transfer well.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nOur experimental results illustrate\
    \ the rich capability of stylizing scenes with various text prompts.\n\n\n\n\n\
    \ \n\n2. Related Work\n\n\n2.1. Implicit 3D Representation\n\nNeRF, introduced\
    \ by the seminal paper (Mildenhall et\_al., 2020), became one of the most popular\
    \ implicit 3D representation techniques due to several benefits. NeRF can render\
    \ photo-realistic novel views with arbitrary resolution due to its continuous\
    \ representation with a compact model compared to explicit representations such\
    \ as polygon mesh or voxels. In our research, we use the \u201Dnerfacto\u201D\
    \ model implemented by Nerfstudio (Tancik et\_al., 2023), which is a combination\
    \ of modular features from multiple papers (Wang et\_al., 2021; Barron et\_al.,\
    \ 2022; M\xFCller et\_al., 2022; Martin-Brualla et\_al., 2021; Verbin et\_al.,\
    \ 2022)\n, designed to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\
