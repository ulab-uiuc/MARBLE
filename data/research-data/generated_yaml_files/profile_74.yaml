  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the interpretability and performance
    of machine learning models, particularly in the context of high-dimensional, low-sample-size
    (HDLSS) tabular data. My recent work has focused on various innovative approaches,
    such as adversarial training to improve the interpretability of convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) for skin cancer diagnosis, where I demonstrated that adversarially
    trained models yield sharper and more coherent saliency maps.


    I have also explored the limitations of concept bottleneck models and proposed
    the Weight Predictor Network with Feature Selection (WPFS) to tackle the challenges
    of high-dimensional biomedical data. This model not only reduces the number of
    learnable parameters but also performs effective feature selection, significantly
    outperforming standard methods across multiple datasets.


    My research extends to GCondNet, a framework that leverages implicit structures
    in tabular data to enhance neural network performance, and TabMDA, a manifold
    data augmentation method that utilizes pre-trained models to improve classifier
    performance on tabular datasets. Additionally, I developed ProtoGate, a prototype-based
    model for feature selection that balances global and local feature selection,
    ensuring consistent predictions with underlying data clusters.


    I am particularly passionate about addressing the challenges posed by small datasets
    in critical fields, leading to my work on TabEBM, a class-conditional generative
    method using Energy-Based Models. This approach generates high-quality synthetic
    data that enhances classification performance, especially in scenarios where data
    is scarce. Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between complex machine
    learning techniques and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction of Causal Discovery\n\
    Causal discovery aims at determining causal relationships purely based on observational\
    \ data by\nleveraging their statistical properties under proper assumptions [Spirtes\
    \ et al., 2000, Peters et al.,\n2017]. The methodology of causal discovery can\
    \ be characterized into constraint-based, score-based,\nand Functional Causal\
    \ Model (FCM)-based references (the differences between ground-truth labels and\
    \ identified causal\ninformation on benchmark datasets) with the differences between\
    \ ground-truth labels and identified\ncausal information on synthetic datasets;\
    \ cf. Fig. 1a. Besides causal information on different levels,\nmetrics also indicate\
    \ model capabilities of capturing joint or individual information, depending on\n\
    the task. For example, individual causal information can be d-separations and\
    \ causal directions. Joint\ncausal information is based on the aggregation and\
    \ integration of individual causal information.\nMetrics on causal skeletons.\
    \ Causal skeletons can be determined by constraint-based causal\ndiscovery Related\
    \ Work\nTo understand tabular data models from different perspectives, and to\
    \ make progress towards better\nreal-world performance, a suite of benchmarks\
    \ with different purposes is needed. In prior bench-\nmarking efforts, Grinsztajn\
    \ et al. [2022] use diverse tabular datasets for investigating the performance\n\
    of tree-based Appendix C.\n5byD={(Xi, Yi,Si)}i=1:N, where XiandYiare either d-connected\
    \ or d-separated conditioning\non the set Si. We then apply conditional independence\
    \ tests to the selected subsets of benchmark\nand synthetic datasets and get introduction\
    \ to causal discovery Experiments\nD.1 Hardware, datasets, software, and implementation\n\
    Hardware. We used one NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti for the benchmarking conclusions should\
    \ be made carefully enough, because a worse performance\ncompared with pseudo\
    \ labels does not necessarily mean that the performance is poor but only\nrepresents\
    \ the relative differences. As shown in Tab. 10, Tabsyn is in general the best\
    \ model over the\nfour real-world datasets on causal skeleton-level evaluation.\
    \ Though CoDi and GReaT can perform\nwell on synthetic data, they do not outperform\
    \ TabSyn in real-world datasets.\nWe pre-process the real-world dataset, Beijing,\
    \ and remove the rows with any missing values and the\ndate and time columns with\
    \ strong correlation (almost deterministic relationship), \"year\", \"month\"\
    ,\n\"day\", \"hour\", and \"cbwd\".\n18Table 7: Benchmark on causal directions\
