  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the intersection of deep learning,
    federated learning, and fog computing, particularly in the context of Industry
    4.0 applications. My work addresses critical challenges such as data privacy,
    class imbalance, and the stochastic nature of inference times in cloud environments.
    I have developed innovative solutions like a federated learning framework that
    enhances model robustness by addressing class imbalance at the local level and
    employing dynamic worker selection strategies.


    My research also delves into the complexities of vehicular networks, where I focus
    on creating robust Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) systems capable of handling
    unpredictable service requests. By implementing uncertainty-aware resource allocation
    methods, I aim to ensure timely responses for autonomous vehicles, significantly
    reducing service miss rates.


    Additionally, I explore the deployment of machine learning applications in fog
    computing environments, proposing statistical resource allocation methods that
    enhance the resilience of industrial operations during peak demands. My approach
    emphasizes the importance of understanding application architectures, particularly
    in micro-service workflows, to optimize resource distribution effectively.


    Through my work, I strive to contribute to the development of agile, reliable,
    and privacy-preserving solutions that can transform industries reliant on real-time
    data processing and decision-making. My goal is to enable seamless integration
    of AI technologies in resource-constrained environments, ultimately enhancing
    operational efficiency and safety in critical sectors.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing cloud computing, particularly
    in the realms of security, efficiency, and usability. My work primarily focuses
    on addressing the challenges associated with data privacy in cloud environments,
    where I have developed innovative solutions such as S3BD, a system that enables
    real-time searching over encrypted big data without exposing sensitive information.
    I have also explored the intricacies of serverless computing, proposing the Object-as-a-Service
    (OaaS) paradigm to streamline cloud-native application development by encapsulating
    both application logic and data.


    My research extends to enhancing the robustness of heterogeneous computing systems,
    where I have introduced task pruning mechanisms to improve Quality of Service
    (QoS) in oversubscribed environments. I have also investigated the performance
    of deep learning applications in cloud and edge systems, revealing critical insights
    into deployment configurations that optimize end-to-end inference times.


    In addition to these contributions, I have developed ClustCrypt, a method for
    efficient topic-based clustering of encrypted data, which significantly improves
    search accuracy and reduces overhead. My work aims to bridge the gap between security
    and functionality in cloud services, ensuring that users can leverage the full
    potential of cloud computing while maintaining the confidentiality of their data.
    Through my research, I strive to create more efficient, secure, and user-friendly
    cloud computing solutions that meet the evolving needs of businesses and individuals
    alike.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nThe Industrial Revolution\
    \ brought about rapid changes\nin operations by incorporating state-of-the-art\
    \ technolo-\ngies. However, various solutions must be synchronized and\nadaptedaccordingly.Thisrapidshiftisprevalent,especially\n\
    in remote sites. Nonetheless, processing emerging opera-\ntional data and smart\
    \ applications on available computing\nplatforms can be challenging in harsh operational\
    \ environ-\nments, which motivates our research work. Therefore, we\nexplore the\
    \ stochastic behaviours and in-depth structure\nof Industry 4.0 applications and\
    \ address the challenges of\nmodern computing platforms in the following sections.\n\
    1.1. Overview and Motivation\nIndustrial systems are rapidly shifting from human-\n\
    controlled processes towards closed-loop serverless con-\ntrol systems that process\
    \ various types of applications to\nmanage industrial operations autonomously.\
    \ Particularly at\nremote sites, such as offshore oil and gas fields (Hussain,\n\
    Mokhtari, Ghalambor and Salehi (2022)), space stations\n(Aume, Andrews, Pal, James,\
    \ Seth and Mukhopadhyay\n(2022)), submarines and underwater robots (ROVs) (Ka-\n\
    banov and Kramar (2022)), the Industry 4.0 paradigm shift\ndemands systems to\
    \ serverlessly process emerging data-\ndriven and latency-sensitive applications\

    To establish an Industry 4.0 system in a remote site\nthatisrobustagainstsuchunpredictabilities,weexplorethe\n\
    challenging idea of augmenting the processing capability\nof the local fog via\
    \ dynamically federating it with nearby\nHussain et al.: Preprint submitted to\
    \ Elsevier Page 1 of 15arXiv:2401.07194v1  [cs.DC]  14 Jan 2024Resource allocation\
    \ across serverless fog federation\nfogsystems( e.g.,mobiledatacenters(Baburao,Pavankumar\n\
    and Prabhu (2023))), thereby, providing cloud-like server-\nless elasticity for\
    \ Industry 4.0 applications. This challenge\nstems from the fact that modern industrial\
    \ applications are\noften cloud-native, and are not originally designed to reap\n\
    thebenefitsofwirelessly-connectedautonomousfogs. There\nis an infrastructural\
    \ gap to adapt these applications to the\nfederatedfogenvironment,andthisgapiswhatthisresearch\n\
    aims at filling . More specifically, the challenge is how to\nestablish the notion\
    \ of serverless such that the applications\ncan seamlessly take advantage of the\
    \ dynamically formed\nfederated fog system? To overcome this challenge, we need\n\
    to deal with two aspects of the federated environments:\n(a) Characteristics of\
    \ the federated fog environment : The\nfederatedfogenvironmentispronetotheuncertaintiesstem\n\
    from the unreliable communication between fog system,\nandheterogeneouscomputingacrossthem.Therefore,these\n\
    uncertainties can potentially affect the latency constraint\nof Industry 4.0 applications\
    \ across the federation. Failure\nto dealing with these uncertainties can potentially\
    \ hurt the\nrobustnessofremotesiteinsteadofhelpingit(Salehi,Smith,\nMaciejewski,\
    \ Siegel, Chong, Apodaca, Briceno, Renner,\nShestak, Ladd et al. (2016)).\n(b)\
    \ Characteristics of Industry 4.0 applications : Most of\nthe current Industry\
    \ 4.0 applications function based on\nMachine Learning (ML-based) and typically\
    \ follow the\nmicro-service-based software architecture (Jwo, Lee and\nLin (2022);\
    \ Wen and Chen (2022)) where a workflow of\nmicro-services (Dragoni, Giallorenzo,\
    \ Lafuente, Mazzara,\nMontesi, Mustafin and Safina (2017)) have to be completed\n\
