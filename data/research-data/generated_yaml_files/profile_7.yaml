  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of autonomous driving
    through innovative frameworks and predictive models. My recent work centers around
    DualAD, a novel autonomous driving system that emulates human reasoning. This
    framework integrates a rule-based motion planner with a text encoder that translates
    driving scenarios into natural language, allowing a large language model (LLM)
    to make informed driving decisions. This dual-layer approach not only enhances
    routine driving tasks but also improves decision-making in critical situations,
    demonstrating significant performance gains over traditional rule-based systems.


    In addition to DualAD, I have tackled the challenges of long-term prediction in
    emergency driving scenarios through the development of the Extro-Spective Prediction
    (ESP) dataset. This dataset addresses the complexities of predicting rare but
    critical events, and I introduced a flexible feature encoder that seamlessly integrates
    with various prediction methods. My work also includes the creation of a new evaluation
    metric, clamped temporal error (CTE), which provides a nuanced assessment of prediction
    performance in time-sensitive situations.


    I am passionate about bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world
    applications in autonomous driving, and I am committed to sharing my findings
    with the community by making datasets and benchmarks publicly available. My research
    aims to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, paving the way
    for a future where autonomous vehicles can navigate complex environments with
    human-like reasoning.'

    framework that allows for the exploration of complex driving scenarios, emphasizing
    the importance of vehicle interactions in enhancing autonomous driving systems.
    This platform not only integrates various planning methodologies but also provides

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nThe rapid development\
    \ of large language models (LLMs) has been phenomenal [ 57]. Take one of\nthe\
    \ most successful model series, the OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, as an example: the\
    \ original GPT-3\nmodel released in 2020 [ 3] marked a significant scale-up from\
    \ GPT-1\u2019s 117 million parameters and\nGPT-2\u2019s 1.5 billion parameters,\
    \ to 175 billion parameters. This scale-up enables the decoder-only\ntransformer-based\
    \ GPT-3 model with in-context learning and generalized capabilities: according\
    \ to\nOpenAI, the GPT-3.5 series improved upon GPT-3 by incorporating instruction\
    \ tuning, supervised\nfine tuning (SFT), and/or reinforcement learning from human\
    \ feedback (RLHF) [ 29]. This has\nnow became a standard procedure to create performing\
    \ LLMs, including the PaLM models [ 6], the\nLLaMA models [41], the Gemini models\
    \ [40], and many more.\nIn a parallel line to the popularly adopted LLMs development\
    \ practices, we proposed the General\nLanguage Model (GLM) architecture [ 11]\
    \ featured with the autoregressive blank infilling objective\nand open-sourced\
    \ the GLM-10B model in 2021 (See the GLM timeline in Figure 1). Starting in late\n\
    2021, we began pre-training GLM-130B [ 53]. The goal was to train a 100B-scale\
    \ model to match or\nsurpass GPT-3 (davinci) while also verifying the techniques\
    \ for successfully training models at this\nscale, along with other contemporary\
    \ efforts such as OPT-175B [ 54] and BLOOM-176B [ 33]. We\ncompleted the 400B-token\
    \ training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July, and subsequently released\nthe\
    \ model and pre-training details [ 53] in August 2022. According to HELM in November\
    \ 2022,\nGLM-130B matches GPT-3 (davinci) across various dimensions [20].\nFollowing\
    \ this, we initiated instruction tuning on GLM-130B. Later, ChatGPT further motivated\
    \ us\nto align the base models with SFT and RLHF. We created and crafted the prompt-response\
    \ pairs from\nscratch and performed SFT, while also starting to examine how to\
    \ effectively apply RLHF. On March\n14, 2023, the aligned model, ChatGLM-130B,\

    \ post-training techniques as well as data selection, and 2) enabling local\n\
    deployment on consumer-grade graphics cards using INT4 quantization. Since then,\

    \ techniques, leading to the second\nand third generations of ChatGLM series every\
    \ other three months, both of which were pre-trained\nentirely from the beginning.\n\
    ChatGLM-6B was pre-trained on approximately one trillion tokens of Chinese and\
