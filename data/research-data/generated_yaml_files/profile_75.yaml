  profile: 'As a researcher in particle physics, my work primarily focuses on enhancing
    our understanding of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and developing
    robust statistical methodologies for high-dimensional data analysis. I have generalized
    previous studies on constraining SMEFT operators using Drell-Yan measurements,
    demonstrating that while fully differential measurements provide valuable insights,
    single differential measurements with finer bins can be equally sensitive for
    specific operators. This finding emphasizes the importance of complementing fully
    differential analyses with targeted projections.


    In addition to my work on SMEFT, I have developed a novel methodology for evaluating
    non-parametric two-sample tests tailored for high-dimensional generative models.
    My research explores various metrics, including the sliced Wasserstein distance
    and the sliced Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which I have shown to be computationally
    efficient and sensitive to data deformations. By applying these tests to diverse
    datasets, including particle physics data from gluon jets, I have established
    that one-dimensional tests can achieve sensitivity comparable to multivariate
    metrics while significantly reducing computational costs.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical statistical
    tools, providing a standardized framework for model comparison in high-dimensional
    settings, ultimately contributing to advancements in both particle physics and
    machine learning methodologies.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of machine learning
    and high-energy physics, with a focus on developing innovative methodologies for
    real-time monitoring and anomaly detection in particle detectors. My recent work
    has centered on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, particularly
    kernel methods and nonparametric learning algorithms, to create efficient, model-independent
    approaches for analyzing experimental data. This includes the design of algorithms
    that assess the compatibility of incoming data with reference samples, enabling
    rapid identification of anomalies.


    In addition to my work in particle physics, I have explored theoretical frameworks
    such as polymer quantization and its implications for field theory, as well as
    the connections between deformed relativity symmetries and Finslerian geometries.
    My research also delves into the application of machine learning for model-independent
    searches for new physics, where I have demonstrated significant improvements in
    computational efficiency and performance compared to traditional methods.


    I am passionate about enhancing scientific methodologies through the integration
    of machine learning, and I strive to develop robust, scalable solutions that can
    be applied across various domains, including environmental monitoring and quantum
    gravity. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of our understanding of fundamental
    physics while pushing the boundaries of computational techniques in scientific
    research.'
