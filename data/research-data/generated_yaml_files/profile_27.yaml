  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance
    in tasks like link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. Additionally, I proposed the ROLAND framework, which facilitates the adaptation
    of static GNNs to dynamic graphs, addressing the challenges of evolving data structures.


    My research extends beyond GNNs; I have investigated the interplay between neural
    network architecture and predictive performance through relational graphs, and
    I have systematically explored the design space of GNNs to provide guidelines
    for optimal architecture selection. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical
    insights and practical applications, ultimately contributing to the development
    of more efficient and effective machine learning models. I am passionate about
    pushing the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve and fostering a deeper understanding
    of their underlying mechanisms.'

    of causal models, enhancing the understanding of instrumental variables, and exploring
    the intricacies of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).


    My recent research delves into qualitative decision-making models, where I aim

    applicable across multiple instances, enhancing the flexibility of AI systems.


    I am particularly interested in the challenges posed by bounded width in planning
    domains and how this concept can be harnessed to develop more efficient algorithms.
    My exploration of graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning generalized policies

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nGeneral policies\
    \ are policies that can be used to solve a collection of planning\nproblems\n\
    reactively\_Srivastava et al. (2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque\
    \ (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\xE9nez\
    \ et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems\
    \ can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from\
    \ the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned\
    \ for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\_Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020);\
    \ St\xE5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the\
    \ types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial\
    \ approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using\
    \ a description logic\ngrammar\_Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\n\
    predicates\_Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning\
    \ approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural\
    \ networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A\
    \ shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\n\
    policies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription\
    \ logics from the C2subscript\U0001D4362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic\
    \ limited to two variables and\ncounting\_Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from\
    \ the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication\
    \ involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\_Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive\
    \ limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these\
    \ methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell\
    \ in an n\xD7n\U0001D45B\U0001D45Bn\\times nitalic_n \xD7 italic_n grid containing\
    \ obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells\
    \ and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\U0001D450\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and\
    \ Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\U0001D450superscript\U0001D450\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\\
    prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with\
    \ atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\U0001D465\U0001D466\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x\
    \ , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\U0001D465superscript\U0001D465\
    \u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and\
    \ Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\U0001D466superscript\U0001D466\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\\
    prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\
    \ \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn\
    \ policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require\
    \ composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\U0001D436\
    2C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\_[St\xE5hlberg et al.,\n\
    2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer\
    \ grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\U0001D4362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\U0001D458kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\U0001D458\
    3k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual\
    \ objects\_Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive\
    \ power of C3subscript\U0001D4363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\U0001D4362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2\
    \ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\_Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs\
    \ do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time\
    \ for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized\
    \ version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\U0001D461\
    titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While\
    \ plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\U0001D446Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning\
    \ state as input, R-GNN[t\U0001D461titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms\
    \ At\u2062(S)subscript\U0001D434\U0001D461\U0001D446A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT\
    \ italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\U0001D4610t=0italic_t\
    \ = 0, R-GNN[t\U0001D461titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221E\
    \U0001D461t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221E, it offers a strong approximation. Thus,\
    \ the parameter t\U0001D461titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with\
    \ computational effort. Crucially, for\nlower values of t\U0001D461titalic_t,\n\
