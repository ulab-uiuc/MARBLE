    Module, which enhances Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for high-resolution
    predictions without the complexity of traditional architectures. This innovation
    has shown promising results in human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and
    object detection.


    In the realm of remote sensing, I developed the Pyramid Time-Series Transformer

    multi-agent systems, particularly under adversarial conditions such as false data
    injection attacks. I propose resilient algorithms that ensure optimal resource
    allocation while maintaining stability, even in the presence of malicious interference.

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the applications of deep learning
    in financial market prediction, particularly focusing on intra-day predictions
    at the minute scale. The rapid fluctuations in stock prices and trading volumes
    present unique challenges, and I strive to develop innovative solutions to enhance

    complexity and improved performance for longer prediction horizons.


    In my research, I have conducted extensive experiments comparing Informer with
    traditional models like LSTM, Transformer, and BERT across various stock and market
    indices. The results consistently demonstrate that Informer outperforms these
    models in terms of prediction accuracy, as measured by metrics such as MAE, RMSE,
    and MAPE. A key finding from my work is the significant impact of the global time
    stamp mechanism, which enhances the model''s ability to capture time series characteristics,
    leading to superior predictive capabilities.


    Additionally, I have explored the transfer learning capabilities of Informer,

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nImage restoration\
    \ aims at reconstructing a high-quality image from its low-quality observation.\
    \ Typical image restoration problems, such as image denoising, deblurring and\
    \ super-resolution, are usually defined under a constrained setting, where the\
    \ degradation process is simple and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). They have\
    \ successfully promoted a vast number of excellent restoration algorithms [12,\
    \ 71, 29, 6, 58, 69, 8], but are born to have limited generalization ability.\
    \ To deal with real-world degraded images, blind image restoration (BIR) comes\
    \ into view and becomes a promising direction. The ultimate goal of BIR is to\
    \ realize realistic image reconstruction on general images with general degradations.\
    \ BIR does not only extend the boundary of classic image restoration tasks, but\
    \ also has a wide practical application field (e.g., old photo/film restoration).\n\
    \n\nTypical BIR problems are blind image super-resolution (BSR), blind image denoising\
    \ (BID), blind face restoration (BFR), etc.\nBSR is initially proposed to solve\
    \ real-world super-resolution problems, where the low-resolution image contains\
    \ unknown degradations.\nThe most popular solutions may be\nBSRGAN [73] and Real-ESRGAN\
    \ [56]. They formulate BSR as a supervised large-scale degradation overfitting\
    \ problem. To simulate real-world degradations, a degradation shuffle strategy\
    \ and high-order degradation modeling are proposed separately. Then the adversarial\
    \ loss [27, 15, 54, 37, 45] and reconstruction loss are incorporated to learn\
    \ the reconstruction process in an end-to-end manner.\nThey have demonstrated\
    \ their great robustness in degradation removal for real-world super-resolution,\
    \ but usually fail in generating realistic details due to the limited generative\
    \ ability.\nBID aims to achieve blind denoising [74, 17] for real-world noisy\
    \ photographs, which usually contain various noises (e.g., dark current noise,\
    \ short noise, and thermal\nnoise) due to the processing in real camera system.\n\
    SCUNet\_[74] is the state-of-the-art method, which designs a practical noise degradation\
    \ model to synthesize the noisy images, and adopts L1 loss as well as optional\
    \ adversarial loss for training a deep denoiser model. Its solution is similar\
    \ as BSR methods and thus has the same weakness.\nBFR only focuses on blind restoration\
    \ for face images.\nDue to a smaller image space, BFR methods (e.g., CodeFormer\
    \ [77], GFPGAN [55]) could incorporate powerful generative facial priors (e.g.,\
    \ VQGAN [13], StyleGAN [22]) to generate faithful and high-quality facial details.\
    \ They have achieved remarkable success in both academia and industry in recent\
    \ years. Nevertheless, BFR assumes a fixed input size and restricted face image\
    \ space, and thus cannot be applied to general images.\n\n\n\nRecently, denoising\
    \ diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs [20]) have shown outstanding performance\
    \ in image generation. DDRM [23], DDNM [57], and GDP [14] incorporate the powerful\
    \ diffusion model as the additional prior, thus having greater generative ability\
    \ than GAN-based methods. With a proper degradation assumption, they can achieve\
    \ impressive zero-shot restoration on classic IR tasks.\nHowever, the problem\
    \ setting of zero-shot image restoration (ZIR) is not in accordance with BIR.\
    \ Their methods can only deal with clearly defined degradations (linear or non-linear),\
    \ but cannot generalize well to unknown degradations.\nIn other words, they can\
    \ achieve realistic reconstruction on general images, but not on general degradations.\n\
    \n\n\nIn this work, we aim to solve different BIR tasks in a unified framework.\n\
    According to the review and analyses on recent progress in BIR tasks,\n\n    \
