  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the reliability and privacy of
    deep learning models, particularly in sensitive domains such as face manipulation
    detection and federated learning. My recent work focuses on developing interpretable
    models that balance accuracy and transparency, such as my approach to face manipulation
    detection, which incorporates feature whitening to clarify the internal workings
    of deep networks.


    I have also explored the intersection of generative models and differential privacy,
    introducing innovative methods like DP-SAD, which leverages diffusion models for
    high-quality, private data generation. My research on dataset condensation has
    led to the development of M3D, a method that minimizes discrepancies between synthetic
    and real data distributions, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging
    datasets.


    In the realm of deepfake detection, I proposed a patch-level approach utilizing
    spatiotemporal dropout transformers to enhance model robustness against sophisticated
    manipulations. Additionally, I have contributed to privacy-preserving model conversion
    through differentially private data-free distillation, ensuring that sensitive
    training data remains protected.


    My work in personalized federated learning emphasizes the importance of tailoring
    models to individual clients while maintaining a global knowledge base. I strive
    to create frameworks that not only advance the state of the art in machine learning
    but also prioritize user trust and data privacy. Through extensive experimentation
    and theoretical validation, I aim to bridge the gap between high utility and strong
    privacy in deep learning applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing the challenges of privacy and
    data scarcity in machine learning, particularly in sensitive domains. My recent
    work focuses on generative models with differential privacy, where I introduced
    DP-SAD, a private diffusion model that leverages stochastic adversarial distillation
    to enhance image generation quality while ensuring privacy. This innovative approach
    combines the strengths of diffusion models with adversarial training, demonstrating
    significant improvements in generated image quality.


    In addition to generative modeling, I have explored the theoretical aspects of
    particle physics, specifically in the context of Chiral Perturbation Theory, where
    I provided a comprehensive analysis of two-pion production reactions. My research
    also extends to federated learning, where I developed a backbone self-distillation
    method to facilitate personalized model training across heterogeneous data sources.
    This method allows clients to maintain privacy while benefiting from global knowledge
    transfer, showcasing my commitment to advancing machine learning techniques that
    prioritize both performance and privacy.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge machine learning
    methodologies and the pressing need for privacy-preserving solutions, contributing
    to a more secure and effective AI landscape.'

    and machine learning, with a particular focus on face recognition, visual tracking,
    and data-efficient learning methods. My recent work has tackled the challenging
    problem of occluded face recognition, where I explored various approaches to enhance
    recognition accuracy despite partial visibility. I have also contributed to the
    development of innovative tracking algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    such as the P-SiamFC++ tracker, which balances efficiency and precision through
    model compression techniques.


    In addition to my work on UAV tracking, I have pioneered methods that leverage
    contrastive learning for improved feature representation, and I have designed
    a super-pixel level cloud detection system that utilizes deep learning for remote
    sensing applications. My research also delves into the integration of 2D landmarks
    and 3D face reconstruction, proposing a joint method that enhances both tasks
    simultaneously.


    I am particularly interested in the intersection of deep learning and practical
    applications, as evidenced by my work on evolutionary knowledge distillation and
    trustable co-label learning, which aim to improve model performance in scenarios
    with limited labeled data. My goal is to create robust, efficient, and scalable

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nFederated learning (FL)\
    \ can leverage distributed user data\nwhile preserving privacy by iteratively\
    \ downloading mod-\nels, training models locally on the clients, uploading models,\n\
    and aggregating models on the server. A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity,\
    \ e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced\
    \ data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel\
    \ that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020;\
    \ T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional\
    \ Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan\
    \ et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their\
    \ local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings,\
    \ e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n\
    2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability\
    \ of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced\
    \ by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients\
    \ based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration.\
    \ By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt\
    \ to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never,\
    \ with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global\
    \ model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et\
    \ al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\n\
    Recently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical\
    \ heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three\
