  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing navigation systems and image
    processing technologies, with a particular focus on accessibility and efficiency.
    My work spans various domains, including indoor navigation for visually impaired
    individuals, where I have evaluated and compared existing systems such as ultrasonic
    and RFID-based solutions. I aim to bridge the gap in navigation technology, ensuring
    that those with visual impairments can navigate their environments more effectively.


    In the realm of image compression, I developed ProgDTD, a novel training method
    that transforms traditional non-progressive image compression models into progressive
    ones. This innovation allows images to load in low resolution and gradually improve,
    significantly enhancing user experience, especially in low-bandwidth scenarios.


    Additionally, I have explored the intricacies of bipartite networks, introducing
    a new measure called H.H to identify influential nodes in community formation.
    This measure provides insights that traditional centrality metrics overlook, demonstrating
    its effectiveness in real-world datasets.


    Most recently, I have focused on Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their deployment
    challenges on resource-constrained devices. My work on HydraViT introduces a scalable
    architecture that adapts to varying hardware environments, achieving superior
    performance without the need for multiple separate models. Through these contributions,
    I strive to push the boundaries of technology, making it more accessible and efficient
    for diverse applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in wireless communication technologies,
    particularly Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and their applications
    in the Internet of Things (IoT). My work focuses on enhancing the reliability
    and efficiency of communication protocols in dynamic environments. One of my notable
    contributions is the development of eAFH, a mechanism that intelligently manages
    channel exclusion and inclusion in Adaptive Frequency Hopping, achieving remarkable
    link-layer reliability even in the presence of dynamic interference.


    I have also explored Two-Way Ranging techniques to enable scalable localization
    of passive tags without the need for synchronized anchors, significantly improving
    distance estimation accuracy. My research extends to self-adaptive protocols like
    Dimmer, which utilize reinforcement learning to optimize performance in varying
    wireless conditions, demonstrating a 95.8% reliability rate against strong interference.


    In addition, I have introduced innovative methods for progressive image compression
    and scalable Vision Transformers, addressing the challenges of deploying advanced
    models on resource-constrained devices. My work on Whisper has led to a fast and
    efficient flooding protocol for multi-hop networks, while EdgeAlpha offers a distributed
    approach to process mining directly on sensor nodes, enhancing scalability and
    reducing communication overhead.


    Through my research, I aim to push the boundaries of wireless communication and
    IoT technologies, ensuring they are robust, efficient, and adaptable to real-world
    challenges.'

    \ However, their compu-\ntational resource requirements can be problematic,\n\
    especially in environments with limited resources.\nTo address this issue, more\
