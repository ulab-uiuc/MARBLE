    leverage knowledge engineering and cognitive architectures to enhance their functionality
    across various domains. My work emphasizes the integration of dialog act modeling
    within holistic systems, allowing agents to expand their ontological and lexical
    knowledge through lifelong learning. I have explored the discovery and representation
    of lexical rules, demonstrating their critical role in large-scale semi-automatic
    lexicon acquisition, particularly in business and finance contexts.


    A significant focus of my research is on the application of large language models
    (LLMs) to facilitate the automatic learning of new semantic entries in intelligent
    agents. By combining knowledge-based methods with LLMs, I have developed hybrid
    learning architectures that enhance the agent''s ability to understand and generate
    natural language.


    I am also passionate about metacognition in artificial intelligence, proposing
    a framework called TRAP that addresses transparency, reasoning, adaptation, and
    perception in AI systems. My work on the HARMONIC framework aims to transform
    general-purpose robots into trusted teammates capable of complex decision-making
    and natural communication, emphasizing the importance of explainability in high-stakes
    AI applications.


    Through my research, I strive to create cognitive agents that not only perform
    tasks but also communicate effectively and provide explanations for their actions,
    fostering trust and collaboration in human-robot teams. My recent projects demonstrate
    the potential of integrating cognitive strategies with natural language communication
    to enhance multi-robot planning and collaboration in real-world scenarios.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of natural language
    generation (NLG) and cognitive robotics, particularly within the OntoAgent cognitive

    I emphasize the integration of knowledge engineering principles to create holistic
    agents capable of lifelong learning and dialog act modeling, which enhances their
    ability to understand and generate natural language.


    One of my recent projects involved leveraging large language model (LLM) technology
    to automatically expand an agent''s semantic lexicon, demonstrating the power

    analytics. I am also deeply invested in the explainable AI (XAI) movement, advocating
    for a human-centered approach that prioritizes user needs in high-stakes environments.
    My work in this area has led to the development of cognitive agents that provide
    transparent explanations, fostering trust in AI systems.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the HARMONIC framework, which transforms general-purpose
    robots into trusted teammates capable of complex decision-making and natural communication.
    My research explores multi-robot collaboration, emphasizing metacognition and
    explainability to enhance human-robot teamwork. Through simulation experiments,
    I have demonstrated the importance of reasoning and communication in achieving
    effective collaboration between heterogeneous robots and humans. Overall, my goal
    is to create intelligent systems that not only perform tasks but also engage meaningfully
    with their human counterparts.'

    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nThe research field of\
    \ eXplainable AI (XAI) has emerged to make AI and machine learning (ML) more transparent\
    \ and\ntrustworthy to humans by opening the AI black-box and explaining its underlying\
    \ operation[ 36]. This rapidly growing\nfield has already made significant breakthroughs\
    \ in technical explainability , producing established XAI algorithms\nsuch as\
    \ LIME [ 84], DeepLIFT [ 89], LRP [ 9]). In comparison, XAI research has limited\
    \ success producing the effective\nexplanations needed by users[ 14,58,108]. As\
    \ a result, most explanations produced by XAI still lack usability, practical\n\
    interpretability, and efficacy for real users [ 1,28,66,111]. A recent study found\
    \ that a significant group of users (over\n30%) were unable to understand the\
    \ XAI explanations sufficiently well to use them even in relatively simple tasks\
    \ [ 70].\nRecently there have been growing efforts, especially from the Human-Computer\
    \ Interaction (HCI) community, to\nadopt more human-centered approaches and rigorous\
    \ empirical evaluation methods in HCI. In DIS 2019 Companion - Companion Publication\
