  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing statistical methodologies and
    machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of anomaly detection,
    contextual bandits, and high-dimensional data analysis. My recent work has focused
    on developing innovative approaches for detecting anomalous patterns in various
    data types, including images and tensors, using multiscale scan statistics. I
    have also explored the challenges posed by biased sampling and missing data, proposing
    robust methods like nearest neighbor matching (NNM) to improve estimates in these
    contexts.


    My research extends to high-dimensional heteroscedastic regression, where I have
    introduced non-convex penalized estimators that achieve oracle properties, and
    I have developed methods for change-point detection in graphs, leveraging generalized
    likelihood ratio statistics. I am particularly interested in the intersection
    of graph theory and statistical inference, as evidenced by my work on the graph
    Fourier scan statistic, which provides a powerful tool for detecting localized
    activations in noisy environments.


    In addition to theoretical advancements, I have applied my methodologies to practical
    problems, such as improving recommendation systems through listwise collaborative
    ranking and enhancing the robustness of contextual bandit algorithms against adversarial
    attacks. My goal is to create scalable, efficient algorithms that not only perform
    well in theory but also translate effectively to real-world applications, ultimately
    contributing to the fields of data science and machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of natural language
    processing (NLP) through innovative approaches to multilingual understanding and
    model adaptation. My work has focused on leveraging the similarities between languages
    to improve semantic dependency parsing and semantic role labeling, particularly
    in low-resource settings. I introduced Rosita, a method for creating multilingual
    contextual word representations, which has shown significant performance improvements
    across various NLP tasks.


    I have also explored the challenges of adapting language models to new domains,
    proposing a fully compositional output embedding layer that enhances model performance,
    especially for low-frequency words. My research extends into the realm of item
    response theory, where I developed a multistage fitting procedure that streamlines
    the scoring of language proficiency tests, demonstrating superior calibration
    and predictive performance.


    In addition to these technical contributions, I am deeply concerned about the
    societal implications of technology, particularly regarding misinformation. My
    collaborative work in this area has led to insights on how technology can both
    propagate and mitigate false information.


    Recently, I have focused on improving evaluation methodologies in NLP by introducing
    contrast sets, which help identify systematic gaps in datasets and provide a more
    accurate assessment of model capabilities. Through my research, I aim to bridge
    the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, ensuring
    that NLP technologies are both effective and responsible.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of language
    processing, machine learning, and educational technology. My work has primarily
    focused on understanding how various statistical properties of language influence
    sentence processing, particularly through the lens of surprisal theory. I have
    provided evidence that local statistics, such as word bigram and trigram probabilities,
    play a significant role in processing difficulty, challenging the notion that
    only conditional probabilities matter.


    In addition to theoretical insights, I have developed practical applications aimed
    at enhancing language learning experiences. My recent project, mHyER, addresses
    the challenge of zero-shot exercise retrieval, leveraging large language models
    to synthesize personalized exercises based on learners'' natural language queries.
    This innovative approach bridges the semantic gap between learner input and exercise
    content, significantly improving retrieval effectiveness.


    I am also passionate about making language models more accessible for non-proficient
    users. My work on CALM (CEFR-Aligned Language Model) demonstrates how to control
    the difficulty of text generated by large language models, achieving superior
    performance at a fraction of the cost of existing models.


    Furthermore, I have contributed to the field of item response theory (IRT) by
    proposing a multistage fitting procedure that integrates seamlessly with automated
    machine learning tools. This approach enhances the calibration and predictive
    performance of language proficiency tests, exemplified by my work on the Duolingo
    English Test.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    ultimately enhancing language learning and assessment methodologies.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of item response theory
    (IRT) and machine learning, particularly in the context of computerized adaptive
    testing (CAT). My recent work focuses on enhancing the modeling workflow for scoring
    tests, exemplified by my development of a multistage fitting procedure that integrates
    seamlessly with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. This approach leverages
    a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) outer loop combined with a two-stage inner loop, allowing
    for efficient training of both non-parametric and item-specific parametric models.


    One of my significant contributions is the application of this methodology to
    the Duolingo English Test, where I demonstrated that our model not only improves
    calibration but also achieves superior predictive performance compared to traditional
    IRT models and neural network extensions like BERT-IRT. I am passionate about
    making advanced statistical methods more accessible and effective in real-world
    applications, and I continuously explore innovative ways to enhance the accuracy
    and reliability of educational assessments. My work aims to bridge the gap between
    complex statistical theories and practical implementations, ultimately contributing
    to more effective and fair testing practices.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nInteractive systems based\
    \ on general-purpose\nLLMs have become widely popular due to their\nimpressive\
    \ instruction-following capabilities (Ope-\nnAI, 2023). Furthermore, tuning these\
    \ models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts\
    \ (Rozi\xE8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned\
    \ models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly\
    \ higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks,\
    \ which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result,\
    \ merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\n\
    bone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and\
    \ space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels\
    \ differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference\
    \ between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper,\
    \ we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\n\
    rEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three\
    \ steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence\
    \ among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that\
    \ samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces\
    \ interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses\
    \ the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\n\
    els considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark\
    \ datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\n\
    We compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude\
    \ sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better\
    \ maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3,\
    \ 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to\
    \ get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\n\
    the model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the\
    \ comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\n\
    A.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results\
    \ of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\n\
    While both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert\
    \ model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate\
    \ that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\n\
    For LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping\
    \ delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too\
    \ many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\n\
