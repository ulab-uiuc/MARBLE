  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in distributed optimization and edge computing,
    with a focus on developing algorithms that enhance collaboration among networked
    agents. My recent work has centered on innovative methods for solving complex
    optimization problems in dynamic environments, particularly through the lens of
    time-varying directed communication networks. I have contributed to the development
    of algorithms like SAB-TV and the AB/Push-Pull method, which leverage gradient
    tracking and consensus mechanisms to achieve linear convergence to optimal solutions.

    where I have proposed frameworks for finding Nash equilibria in non-cooperative
    convex games. By incorporating techniques such as heavy-ball momentum and decentralized
    information exchange, I aim to improve the efficiency and privacy of resource
    allocation in mobile edge computing scenarios.


    Additionally, I have addressed challenges in edge network operations, proposing
    models that account for uncertainties in link delays and workload allocation.
    My work emphasizes the importance of robust decision-making in edge computing
    environments, ensuring both service quality and fairness during disruptions.


    Through extensive numerical simulations, I validate the effectiveness of my algorithms,

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            Abstract \u2014This paper analyzes the\
    \ impact of imperfect com-\nmunication channels on decentralized federated learning\
    \ (D-\nFL) and subsequently determines the optimal number of lo-\ncal aggregations\
    \ per training round, adapting to the network\ntopology and imperfect channels.\
    \ We start by deriving the bias\nof locally aggregated D-FL models under imperfect\
    \ channels\nfrom the ideal global models requiring perfect channels and\naggregations.\
    \ The bias reveals that excessive local aggregations\ncan accumulate communication\
    \ errors and degrade convergence.\nAnother important aspect is that we analyze\
    \ a convergence\nupper bound of D-FL based on the bias. By minimizing the\nbound,\
    \ the optimal number of local aggregations is identified\nto balance a trade-off\
    \ with accumulation of communication\nerrors in the absence of knowledge of the\
    \ channels. With this\nknowledge, the impact of communication errors can be alleviated,\n\
    allowing the convergence upper bound to decrease throughout\naggregations.Experiments\
    \ on the CNN and\nResNet-18 models have validated our convergence analysis. It\n\
    has been shown that D-FL with the optimal number of local\naggregations outperforms\
    \ C-FL and D-FL without optimizing\nlocal aggregations by 12.5% and 10% in training\
    \ accuracy,\nrespectively, when the channel conditions are unknown. In the\nfuture,\
    \ we plan to investigate the impact of mobility and non-\ni.i.d. errors in communication\
    \ links on the convergence and\nreliability of D-FL. We also plan to study model\
    \ selection for\nD-FL, where each device can adaptively select the models for\n\
    aggregation under fast-changing fading channels.methods. Other studies [8], [9],\
    \ [13] considered\nD-FL protocols under assumptions of imperfect channels, but\n\
    none analyzed the impact of the accumulation of communica-\ntion errors resulting\
    \ from multiple local aggregations.\nThis paper investigates the impact of local\
    \ model inconsis-\ntency resulting from imperfect/unreliable channels and local\n\
    model aggregation strategies on the convergence of D-FL,\nwhere parts of models\
    \ can be corrupted due to transmission\nerrors and precluded from local model\
    \ aggregations. The\nconvergence upper bound of D-FL is rigorously analyzed.\n\
    Insights are drawn to help optimally decide the number of\nlocal aggregations\
    \ per local training round, adapting to the\ntopology and channel conditions of\
    \ D-FL.\nThe key contributions of the paper are as follows.\n\u2022We consider\
    \ a new scenario of D-FL under imperfect\nchannels, where the initialization of\
    \ local training is\ndesigned to allow different devices\u2019 models to converge\n\
    after training.\n\u2022We derive the bias of locally aggregated D-FL models\n\
    under imperfect channels from the ideal global model,arXiv:2405.12894v1  [cs.DC]\
    \  21 May 20242\nand analyze the convergence upper bound of D-FL under\nimperfect\
    \ channels based on the bias.\n\u2022We reveal that increasing local iterations\
    \ facilitates con-\nvergence in imperfect channels, while increasing local\naggregations\
    \ entails a trade-off with the accumulation of\ncommunication errors within the\
    \ convergence bound.\n\u2022We minimize the convergence upper bound by optimizing\n\
    the number of local aggregations to restrain the impact\nof communication errors\
    \ when the channel conditions\nare unknown a-priori . On the other hand, the a-priori\n\
    knowledge of the channels can help mitigate the impact\nso that more local aggregations\
