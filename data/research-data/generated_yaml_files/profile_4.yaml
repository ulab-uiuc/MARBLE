  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nDeep probabilistic\
    \ State Space Models (SSMs) are versatile tools widely used in Reinforcement Learning\
    \ (RL) for environments with high-dimensional, partial, or noisy observations\_\
    [22, 34, 38, 5, 25, 41].\nThey model states and observations as random variables\
    \ and relate them through a set of conditional distributions, allowing them to\
    \ capture uncertainties and learn concise probabilistic representations for downstream\
    \ RL applications.\nBeyond RL, recent deterministic SSMs\_[16, 48, 15] offer a\
    \ powerful new paradigm for general sequence modeling and rival state-of-the-art\
    \ transformers while improving computational complexity\_[15].\nThese models assume\
    \ states and observations are vectors related by deterministic, linear, and associative\
    \ functions, which allow efficient time-parallel computations.\nSuch deterministic\
    \ models are often insufficient for RL with complex observations, where uncertainty\
    \ awareness and probabilistic modeling are crucial\_[10, 34, 23].\nIn contrast,\
    \ due to their nonlinear parameterizations and inference approaches, most existing\
    \ probabilistic SSMs for RL and beyond do not feature the favorable scaling behavior\
    \ of recent deterministic SSMs.\n\n\nMany real-world applications require both\
    \ uncertainty awareness and the capability of handling long sequences.\nExamples\
    \ include multi-modal robotics tasks with high-frequency control, long sequence\
    \ non-stationary tasks, or complex information-gathering tasks.\nConsider a robot\
    \ tasked with packing objects of unknown properties into a basket.\nBy interacting\
    \ with each item to infer and memorize properties such as mass and deformability,\
    \ the robot refines its understanding of the scene, enabling it to strategically\
    \ arrange the objects in the basket.\nCurrent deterministic SSMs lack uncertainty\
    \ awareness to solve such tasks, while their probabilistic counterparts do not\
    \ scale to the required sequence lengths.\nThus, the question of how to develop\
    \ a principled method that combines the benefits of both paradigms to obtain robust\
    \ and efficient probabilistic state space models for long-sequence RL under uncertainty\
    \ arises.\n\n\nWe propose an efficient architecture for RL that equips probabilistic\
    \ SSMs with the efficiency of recent deterministic SSMs.\nOur approach, KalMamba,\
    \ uses (extended) Kalman filtering and smoothing\_[28, 40, 27] to infer belief\
    \ states over a linear Gaussian SSM in a latent space that uses a dynamics model\
    \ based on Mamba\_[15].\nIn this approach, Mamba acts as a highly effective general-purpose\
    \ sequence-to-sequence model to learn the parameters of a dynamics model.\nThe\
    \ Kalman Smoother uses this model to compute probabilistic beliefs over system\
    \ states.\nFigure\_1 provides a schematic overview.\nMamba is efficient for long\
    \ sequences as it uses parallel associative scans, which allow parallelizing associative\
    \ operators on highly parallel hardware accelerators such as GPUs\_[44].\nSimilarly,\
    \ we formulate both Kalman filtering and smoothing as associative operations\_\
    [42] and build efficient parallel scans for filtering and smoothing in PyTorch\_\
    [39].\nWith both Mamba and the Kalman Smoother being parallelizable, KalMamba\_\
    achieves time-parallel computation of belief states required for model learning\
    \ and control.\nThus, unlike previous approaches for efficient SSM-based RL\_\
    [41], which rely on simplified inference assumptions,\_KalMamba enables end-to-end\
    \ model training under high levels of uncertainty using a smoothing inference\
    \ and tight variational lower bound\_[5].\nWhile using smoothed beliefs for model\
    \ learning, our architecture ensures a tight coupling between filtered and smoothed\
    \ belief states.\nThis inductive bias ensures the filtered beliefs are meaningful,\
    \ allowing their use for policy learning and execution where future observations\
    \ are unavailable.\n\n\nWe evaluate\_KalMamba\_on several tasks from the DeepMind\
    \ Control (DMC) Suite\_[50], training an off-the-shelf Soft Actor-Critic\_[21]\
    \ on beliefs inferred from both images\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n      \
