  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in stylized text-to-image generation, with
    a keen interest in bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual representation.
    My recent work introduces InstaStyle, a novel approach that enables the generation
    of high-fidelity stylized images using just a single reference image. I discovered
    that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image carries essential style
    signals, which I harness through DDIM inversion and a diffusion model to create
    new images that accurately reflect the desired style.


    Understanding the challenges posed by the inherent ambiguity of textual prompts,
    I also developed a learnable style token that refines these prompts, enhancing
    the precision of style conveyance. My research not only demonstrates superior
    performance against existing benchmarks but also explores creative avenues such
    as style combination through mixed inversion noise. I am passionate about pushing
    the boundaries of generative models and contributing to the evolving landscape
    of AI-driven creativity.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nAutonomous vehicles (A\
    \ Vs) are transforming the trans-\nportation systems. A V is a complex system\
    \ integrating a\npipeline of modules such as perception of obstacles, plan-\n\
    ning of driving behaviors, and controlling of the physical\nvehicle [1, 3]. Specifically,\
    \ trajectory prediction in the per-\nception module predicts the future trajectories\
    \ of nearby\nmoving objects. The prediction is essential for the plan-\nning module\
    \ and affects A V\u2019s driving behavior. Therefore,\naccurate trajectory prediction\
    \ is critical for safe A V driving.\nMany studies propose trajectory prediction\
    \ models based\non deep neural networks [8, 10, 11, 13, 21, 23, 24, 27, 32, 33,\n\
    35, 38, 41, 42]. They evaluate the models on benchmarks\ncollected from real world\
    \ using the average \u21132distance be-\ntween ground truth and predicted trajectories\
    \ as the key\nmetric. However, few studies evaluate trajectory prediction\nmodels\
    \ from the perspective of security or analyze the ro-\nbustness against adversarial\
    \ examples. For trajectory pre-\ndiction, if the adversary can control the position\
    \ of a vehi-\ncle close to the target A V , e.g., by driving the vehicle along\n\
    a crafted trajectory, the adversary can influence the A V\u2019s\ntrajectory prediction\
    \ and driving behaviors.To bridge this gap, we propose new white/black box ad-\n\
    versarial attacks on trajectory prediction, which adds minor\nperturbation on\
    \ normal trajectories to maximize the pre-\ndiction error. Compared with adversarial\
    \ attacks on im-\nage/video classification, attacking trajectory prediction is\n\
    unique in two aspects. First, the attack requires natural-\nness [40] of the adversarial\
    \ examples. Adversarial trajec-\ntories are natural if they obey physical rules\
    \ and are possi-\nble to happen in the real world. With naturalness, the tra-\n\
    jectories can be reproduced by the attacker-controlled ve-\nhicle in the real\
    \ world and cannot be easily classified as\nanomaly by A Vs. To realize naturalness,\
    \ we enforce con-\nstraints on physical properties (e.g., velocity and accelera-\n\
    tion) of the perturbed trajectory during optimization solv-\ning. Second, we need\
    \ to define optimization objectives that\nare semantically-attractive for attackers\
    \ targeting trajectory\nprediction. To this end, we find multiple attractive attack\n\
    dimensions can co-exist even for the same scenario (e.g.,\ncausing the predicted\
    \ trajectory to deviate laterally or lon-\ngitudinally are both of interest to\
    \ attackers in A V context).\nThus, in our attack design we consider different\
    \ metrics of\nprediction error as optimization objectives, e.g., average lat-\n\
    eral/longitudinal deviation to four different directions.\nWe evaluate the proposed\
    \ attacks on 10 different com-\nbinations of prediction models [18, 20, 30] and\
    \ trajectory\ndatasets [2,5,16]. The results.\nE. Attack Real-world A V System\n\
    Our attack is effective on real A V software, Baidu Apollo\n6.0 [3], which uses\
    \ an LSTM predictor on 2 seconds of his-\ntory trajectory in a frequency of 10\
    \ Hz. Figure 13 shows\nthat the adversarial trajectory spoofs fake lane changing\
    \ (in\nthe left figure), resulting in a brake of the right Apollo A V\n(in LGSVL\
    \ simulator [28]). Second, history length and fre-\nquency are system-specific\
    \ settings, and prediction models\nmostly choose 2-3 seconds of history and 2-10\
    \ Hz. Al-\nthough we showed different values for the two parameters\nin Tab.1,\
    \ we did not observe a clear correlation between the\nparameters and prediction\
    \ accuracy. We can openly discuss\nthis question as future work. methods, which\
    \ require parameters about\nevolution speed and maximum iterations. When tuning\
    \ the\nparameters, we monitor the objective loss over time. The\nparameters are\
    \ proper if the loss is overall decreasing and\nstays low stably in\n\n      \
