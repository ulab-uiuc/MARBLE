  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing the challenges posed by the
    SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through innovative therapeutic approaches. My recent work
    focuses on the identification of natural compounds that can inhibit the human
    transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a critical enzyme that facilitates
    viral entry into host cells. By employing advanced in-silico methods, I constructed
    a 3D model of TMPRSS2 and screened 95 natural compounds derived from microalgae.
    This effort led to the identification of 17 promising candidates with binding
    affinities comparable to the standard inhibitor, camostat.


    My research emphasizes the importance of understanding the pharmacokinetic and
    pharmacodynamic profiles of these compounds, as well as their potential toxicity.
    The top candidates, including apigenin, catechin, and epicatechin, demonstrated
    strong binding energies, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents against
    SARS-CoV-2. I believe that further in vivo and in vitro studies are essential
    to translate these findings into viable drug candidates. My work aims to contribute
    to the global effort in combating COVID-19 by exploring the untapped potential
    of natural compounds in drug development.'

    Challenge 2024, which explores this association in multilingual contexts. I am
    passionate about improving animal welfare through technology, having developed
    a large-scale annotated dataset of animal faces to facilitate better understanding
    and monitoring of animal behavior.


    My research also delves into enhancing object detection and segmentation methods,
    particularly in challenging scenarios such as domain generalization and personalized

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nMedical images such as\
    \ X-rays, CTs, and MRIs\nare commonly used to diagnose, monitor, or treat\nmedical\
    \ conditions in clinical practice (FDA, 2022).\nWith the rapid growth of medical\
    \ images and the\ncorresponding reports data, researchers have de-\nveloped various\
    \ deep learning models to support\nclinical decision making (\xC7all\u0131 et\
    \ al., 2021).\nRecently, large-scale image-text pre-training,\ne.g., CLIP (Radford\
    \ et al., 2021), has achieved\nconsiderable successes in computer vision and nat-\n\
    ural language processing domains. CLIP is trained\nto predict the correct matching\
    \ of a batch of images\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/\nRyanWangZf/MedCLIP\

    \ GLoRIA (Huang et al.,\n2021) when using different amounts of data for pre-\n\
    training. ConVIRT and GLoRIA are trained on\nMIMIC-CXR (369K) and CheXpert (191K)\
    \ dataset, re-\nspectively. Our method yields superior ACC than GLo-\nRIA using\
    \ near 1=10of pre-training data.\nand text training examples. The joint-training\
    \ of im-\nage and text representations on large-scale image-\ntext pairs generates\
    \ transferable representations and\nsupports \uFB02exible downstream tasks. Inspired\
    \ by\nsuccess of CLIP, we believe the knowledge jointly\nlearned from medical\
    \ images and reports should be\nhelpful for downstream clinical tasks.\nHowever,\
    \ adopting vision-text pre-training on\nmedical domain is a non-trivial task due\
    \ to (1)\nCLIP\u2019s (Radford et al., 2021) data-hungry nature:\nCLIP is trained\
    \ on a dataset of 400M image-text\npairs collected from the internet, while the\
    \ total\nnumber of publicly available medical images and\nreports is orders of\
    \ magnitude below; and (2) speci-\n\uFB01city of medical images and reports: compared\
    \ to\ngeneral domains (e.g., \"cats\" v.s. \"dog\"), the dif-\nferences within\
    \ medical domains are more subtle\nand \uFB01ne-grained (e.g., \"pneumonia\" v.s.\
    \ \"consoli-\ndation\"). In a nutshell, it is necessary to (1) address\nthe data\
    \ insuf\uFB01ciency issue; and (2) capture the\nsubtle yet crucial medical meanings.arXiv:2210.10163v1\
