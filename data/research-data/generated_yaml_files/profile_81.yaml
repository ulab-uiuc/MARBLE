  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of agents in
    understanding and executing complex written instructions through advanced reinforcement
    learning (RL) techniques. My recent work has focused on language reward shaping
    (LRS), where I critically examined its effectiveness and identified inherent brittleness
    in existing methods. I demonstrated that agents trained with LRS rewards often
    converge more slowly than those using pure RL, highlighting the need for more
    robust designs.


    In my exploration of large language models (LLMs), I developed a novel approach
    that constructs an action schema library to generate diverse interpretations of
    natural language descriptions. This method, combined with a semantic validation
    and ranking module, allows for fully automated planning without expert intervention,
    significantly improving scalability and accessibility in AI planning.


    Additionally, I have investigated the vulnerabilities of vision-language models
    (VLMs) as reward signals in sparse environments. My research revealed that noise
    in reward signals can severely hinder agent performance, leading to the introduction
    of BiMI (Binary Mutual Information), a noise-resilient reward function. This innovation
    has shown remarkable improvements in agent performance, making VLM-based reward
    models more practical for real-world applications.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between natural language understanding
    and effective agent behavior, paving the way for more intuitive and capable AI
    systems.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of planning and decision-making
    in artificial intelligence. My work primarily focuses on width-based algorithms,
    which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in classical planning and
    have been successfully adapted to both model-based and model-free settings. I
    have explored various innovative techniques, such as classical count-based novelty
    and regression-based supervised learning, to enhance exploration and learning
    efficiency in planning tasks.


    My recent contributions include developing novel algorithms that leverage action
    novelty rank for generalized planning and creating a robust framework for goal
    recognition that aligns more closely with human inference. I have also investigated
    the integration of language reward shaping in reinforcement learning, revealing
    critical vulnerabilities and proposing noise-resilient reward functions to improve
    agent performance.


    In multi-agent planning, I have addressed privacy concerns by employing best-first
    width search techniques, demonstrating their effectiveness in decentralized settings.
    My research extends to epistemic planning, where I have introduced functional
    STRIPS to enhance scalability and expressiveness.


    Additionally, I have developed Planimation, an open-source framework for visualizing
    planning solutions, and explored the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search for generating
    diverse and high-quality plans in complex environments. My work on transhumeral
    prostheses highlights the application of goal recognition systems using time series
    data, showcasing the potential for improving assistive technologies.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical advancements with practical applications,
    contributing to the development of intelligent systems that can effectively navigate
    complex decision-making scenarios.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of natural language
    processing (NLP) through innovative methodologies that address the challenges
    of low-resource languages, model bias, and the complexities of language understanding.
    My recent work focuses on enhancing cross-lingual projection and model transfer,
    where I developed a debiasing layer that corrects errors in projected annotations,
    achieving state-of-the-art results in low-resource settings.


    I have also explored the integration of syntactic structures in coreference resolution,
    demonstrating the importance of constituent trees alongside dependency trees.
    My research extends to probabilistic methods for machine translation quality estimation,
    where I emphasize the significance of uncertainty in predictions. Additionally,
    I have contributed to user geolocation modeling and dialect detection, leveraging
    neural networks to achieve superior performance on benchmark datasets.


    My work on adversarial learning aims to create fairer models by employing diverse
    discriminators to mitigate bias effectively. I am passionate about developing
    robust models that generalize well across domains, ensuring that they are not

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            Abstract \u2014 Autonomous robot navigation\
    \ and manipulation\nin open environments require reasoning and replanning with\n\
    closed-loop feedback. We present COME-robot, the first closed-\nloop framework\
    \ utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language founda-\ntion model for open-ended reasoning\
    \ and adaptive planning\nin real-world scenarios. We meticulously construct a\
    \ library\nof action primitives for robot exploration, navigation, and\nmanipulation,\
    \ serving as callable execution modules for GPT-\n4V in task planning. On top\
    \ of these modules, GPT-4V serves as\nthe brain that can accomplish multimodal\
    \ reasoning, generate\naction policy with code, verify the task progress, and\
    \ provide\nfeedback for replanning. Such design enables COME-robot to\n(i) actively\
    \ perceive the environments, (ii) perform situated rea-\nsoning, and (iii) recover\
    \ from failures. Through comprehensiveexperiments on a real robot,\nshowcasing\
    \ state-of-the-art quantitativemethods may require varying numbers of steps\n\
    for the same task, especially considering COME-robot\u2019s re-\nplanning mechanism.\
    \ Additionally, to unveil COME-robot\u2019s\nability to recover from failure,\
    \ we report the recovery rate\n(RR) of COME-robot by tallying all replanned executions\n\
    and the successful ones within these executions.\nB. Experimentalresults on mobile\
    \ manipulation.\nMobile TaskCaP* COME-robot\nSR SSR SR SSR RR\nMOVE TOY 2 / 5\

    \ wrong detection problem. For missed detections, COME-\nrobot directs perception\
    \ modules to rebuild the local object\nscene graph and re-detect the missing object,\
    \ achieving a\n100% recover rate as shown in Tab. IV. For wrong detections,\n\
    COME-robot utilizes GPT-4V to conduct a verification step\nfor detected objects.\
    \ For example, in case 3 of Fig. 5, when\ntheexplore_local function detects multiple\
    \ candidate\ncups, COME-robot verifies each cup with image observations\nand finds\
    \ that cup_0 is actually a doll that is wrongly\ndetected as cup and not related\
    \ to the task. Though this\nverification process can help mitigate the problem,\
    \ it is\nstill error-prone to incorrect predictions, leaving 6 falsely\ndetected\
    \ objects after verification, with three of which lead\nto task failure as shown\
    \ in Tab. IV. Other errors stem from\nmistakes in visual analysis, which are due\
    \ to the blurred\nimages or issues inherent to the VLM. For instance, in\ncase\
    \ 1 of Fig. 5, when GPT-4V attempts to confirm the\nsuccess of the placement,\
    \ it only sees two cups because\nthe image fails to capture the cups completely,\
    \ leading to\na misjudgment. However, COME-robot corrects this error\nby conducting\
    \ another local exploration and discovering that\nthere are actually three cups\
    \ on the table.\nb) Execution Failures: COME-robot\u2019s GPT-4V-based\nplanning\
    \ method may sometimes generate incorrect plans\nor invalid API calls, such as\
    \ attempting to place an object\nwithout prior grasping or calling the navigation\
    \ function with\nan object name instead of an object. For these errors, COME-\n\
    robot verifies the generated plan and code, and triggers\nexceptions during execution,\
    \ providing explicit feedback in-dicating the missing step or wrong function call\
    \ for GPT-4V\nto rectify the plan. For actual execution, the primary source\n\
    of failed execution is caused by unsuccessful grasps. Grasp-\ning failures are\
    \ primarily due to the impractical position\nthe robot navigates to that significantly\n\
