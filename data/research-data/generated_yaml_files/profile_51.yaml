  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nThe recent advancements\
    \ in singing voice synthesis, exempli-\nfied by models such as VISinger [1] and\
    \ DiffSinger [2], have\nbrought significant progress to the field of singing voice\
    \ gener-\nation. However, these developments have also raised concerns\namong\
    \ artists, record companies, and publishing houses. The\npotential for unauthorized\
    \ synthetic reproductions that closely\nimitate a singer\u2019s voice threatens\
    \ the commercial value of the\noriginal artists. As society becomes increasingly\
    \ aware of these\nissues, there is a pressing need to develop accurate methods\
    \ consider capturing the musical in-\nformation, such as pitch, rhythms, and so\
    \ on.\n3. SingGraph detection training framework\nThe SingGraph detection training\
    \ framework, as shown in Fig-\nure 1, consists of two key components: singing\
    \ voice augmen-\ntation techniques, including RawBoost and Beat matching, and\n\
    the core SingGraph model. We use Demucs1to separate a\nmixed singing song xinto\
    \ instrumental xinsand vocal xvoc\ncomponents. Following separation, we apply\
    \ data augmenta-\ntion to create augmented instrumental x\u2032insand vocal x\u2032\
    voc\ntracks. The SingGraph model then processes these augmented\ninputs to verify\
    \ whether the input is a genuine singing perfor-\nmance or a fake singing recording.\n\
    3.1. Singing voice augmentation\nTo boost performance, we leverage RawBoost for\
    \ vocal aug-\nmentation and beat matching for instrumental augmentation.\n3.1.1.\
    \ Beat matching for instrumental.\nIn this part, we will introduce a data augmentation\
    \ method\nbased on music domain knowledge. Musical compositions con-\nsist of\
    \ various elements, including chord progressions, timbre,\nand beats, with beats\
    \ being essential for setting the musical\nstructure and alignment. In the audio\
    \ domain, mixup [17] is\na favored augmentation technique that blends pairs of\
    \ audio\ntracks to expand the training dataset. However, mixing in-\nstrumental\
    \ and vocal tracks with differing tempos can lead to\na disordered and unattractive\
    \ outcome. We propose the beat\nmatching for instrumental augmentation to correspond\
    \ to vo-\ncals as shown in Figure 1-(b). Firstly, we employ a cutting-\nedge beat\
    \ tracking model ALL-in-one [18] to determine each\nmusic track\u2019s tempo and\
    \ downbeat map. We then organize each\ntrack into tempo-specific groups. During\
    \ training, we randomly\nselect an instrumental x\u2032\ninsto replace the original\
    \ pair instru-\nmental xinsfrom the same tempo group to maintain consis-\ntent\
    \ tempos. Additionally, we conduct downbeat alignment to\nchoose an appropriate\
    \ downbeat as the starting point for mixing\nsinging voices. This pre-processing\
    \ strategy enhances our abil-\nity to choose suitable music data for mixing, creating\
    \ tracks that\nare harmoniously aligned in terms of tempo and downbeat.\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs3.1.2.\
    \ RawBoost for vocal.\nWe introduce a trick, inspired by stationary signal-independent\n\
    additive noise with random coloration. This trick significantly\nboosts speech\
    \ deepfake detection by RawBoost [13,19]. There-\nfore, it is reasonable to adopt\
    \ it for vocal augmentation in\nSingFake scenario, as the vocal part of singing\
    \ also belongs\nto speech. As depicted in Figure 1-(a), the vocal input of the\n\
    model, x\u2032voc, is generated by the equation:\nx\u2032\nvoc=xvoc+gsi\nsnr\xB7\
    zsi (1)\nwhere zsirepresents white noise wthat has been processed\nthrough a finite\
    \ impulse response (FIR) filter, adjusted by a gain\nparameter gsi\nsnrbased on\
    \ a random signal-to-noise ratio.\n3.2. SingGraph model\nThis section introduces\
    \ the proposed novel SingGraph model.\nThe SingGraph model, depicted in Figure\
    \ 1-(c), integrates in-\nstrumental and vocal encoders based on self-supervised\
    \ learn-\ning (SSL) models with a graph-based back-end model. This\nback-end leverages\
    \ graph neural networks [20\u201322], which have\nled to significant advancements\
    \ in various applications, includ-\ning speaker verification [22] and spoofing\
    \ detection [3, 20, 23],\nby employing a structure of interconnected nodes and\
    \ edges.\nIt encompasses components for aggregating singing voice fea-\ntures,\
    \ modeling\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
