  profile: 'As a researcher in the financial and cryptocurrency domain, my primary
    focus is on enhancing the accuracy of cryptocurrency price trend predictions through
    innovative artificial intelligence techniques. Recognizing the complexities posed
    by the vast and volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, I developed a novel
    approach called hard and soft information fusion (HSIF). This method integrates
    hard data, such as historical prices and technical indicators, with soft data
    derived from social media sentiment, specifically utilizing BERT-based sentiment
    analysis through FinBERT.


    My work emphasizes the importance of capturing both quantitative and qualitative
    factors influencing market movements. By employing a bidirectional long short-term
    memory (BiLSTM) model, I can effectively process information in both directions,
    allowing for a deeper understanding of long-term dependencies in price trends.
    The empirical results from my studies demonstrate the HSIF approach''s superiority
    over traditional models that rely solely on single-source data, achieving an impressive
    96.8% accuracy in predicting Bitcoin price movements.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between technical analysis and social
    sentiment, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding cryptocurrency
    price fluctuations. I am passionate about leveraging AI to unlock insights in
    this rapidly evolving field, and I look forward to further exploring the intersection
    of technology and finance.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nForecasting price movements\
    \ in the \fnancial market is a di\x0Ecult task. Ac-\ncording to the E\x0Ecient-Market\
    \ hypothesis (Kirkpatrick & Dahlquist, 2008),\nstock market prices follow a random\
    \ walk process with unpredictable future\n\ructuations. When it comes to Bitcoin,\
    \ its price \ructuates highly, which makes\nits forecasting challenging (Phaladisailoed\
    \ & Numnonda, 2018). Technical and\nfundamental analysis are two typical tools\
    \ used by traders to build their trading\nstrategies in the \fnancial markets.\
    \ According to price movement and trading\nvolume, technical analysis provides\
    \ trading signals (Murphy, 1999). Fundamen-\ntal analysis, unlike the former,\
    \ examines related economic and \fnancial factors\nto determine a security's underlying\
    \ worth (Drakopoulou, 2016).\nHumans and computers both perform data analysis.\
    \ Although humans are\nable to keep an eye on \fnancial charts (such as prices)\
    \ and make decisions based\non their past experiences, managing a vast volume\
    \ of data is complicated due to\nvarious factors in\ruencing the price movement.\
    \ As a result, algorithmic trading\nhas emerged to tackle this issue. Algorithmic\
    \ trading is a type of trading where\na computer that has been pre-programmed\
    \ with a speci\fc set of mathematical\nrules is employed (Th\x13 eate & Ernst,\
    \ 2021). There are two sorts of approaches\nin \fnancial markets: price prediction\
    \ and algorithmic trading. Price prediction\naims to build a model that can precisely\
    \ predict future prices, whereas algorith-\nmic trading is not limited to the\
    \ price prediction and attempts to participate\nin the \fnancial market (e.g.\
    \ choosing a position and the number of trading\nshares) to maximize pro\ft (Hirchoua\
    \ et al., 2021). It is claimed that a more\nprecise prediction does not necessarily\
    \ result in a higher pro\ft. In other words,\na trader's overall loss due to incorrect\
    \ actions may be greater than the gain due\nto correct ones (Li et al., 2019).\
    \ Therefore, algorithmic trading has been the\nfocus of this study.\nClassical\
    \ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), which are power-\nful tools for\
    \ recognizing patterns, have been employed in various research \felds.\nIn recent\
    \ years, using the ML as an intelligent agent has risen in popularity over\n2the\
    \ alternative of the traditional approaches in which a human being makes a\ndecision.\
    \ For two reasons, the ML and DL have enhanced theperformance in\nalgorithmic\
    \ trading. Firstly, they can extract complex patterns from data that\nare di\x0E\
    cult for humans to accomplish. Secondly, emotion does not a\vect their\nperformance,\
    \ which is a disadvantage for humans (Chakole et al., 2021). How-\never, there\
    \ are two compelling reasons why the ML and DL in a supervised\nlearning approach\
    \ are unsuitable for algorithmic trading. Firstly, supervised\nlearning is improper\
    \ for learning problems with long-term and delayed rewards\n(Dang, 2019), such\
    \ as trading in \fnancial markets, which is why Reinforcement\nLearning (RL),\
    \ a sub\feld of ML, is required to solve a decision-making prob-\nlem (trading)\
    \ in an uncertain environment (\fnancial market) using the Markov\nDecision Process\
    \ (MDP). Secondly, in supervised learning, labeling is a critical\nissue a\vecting\
    \ the performance of the \fnal model. To illustrate, classi\fcation\nand regression\
    \ approaches with de\fned labels may not be appropriate, leading\nto the selection\
    \ of RL, which does not require labels and instead uses a goal\n(reward function)\
    \ to determine its policy.\nRecent studies have usually employed discrete action\
    \ space RL to address\nalgorithmic trading problems (Chakole et al., 2021; Jeong\
    \ & Kim, 2019; Shi\net al., 2021; Th\x13 eate & Ernst, 2021), which compels\n\n\
