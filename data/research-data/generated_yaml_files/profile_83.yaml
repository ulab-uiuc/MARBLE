  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nThe advent of large language\
    \ models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)\nmarks\
    \ a significant milestone in the evolution of artificial intelligence. The research\
    \ integrating LLMs with\nvarious disciplines, i.e., LLM+X, such as math, science,\
    \ finance, healthcare, law, etc., is starting as a new\nepoch powered by collaborative\
    \ endeavors spanning diverse communities. In this survey paper, we offer an\n\
    exploration of the methodologies, applications, challenges, ethics, and future\
    \ opportunities of LLMs within\ncritical societal domains , including finance,\
    \ healthcare , andlaw. These domains are major cornerstones\nof societal function\
    \ and well-being, each playing a critical role in the fabric of daily life and\
    \ the broader\neconomic and social systems. They are frequently discussed together\
    \ due to shared characteristics, including\nthereliance on extensive professional\
    \ expertise ,highly confidential data ,extensive multimodal documents ,high\n\
    legal risk and strict regulations , and the requirement for explainability and\
    \ fairness.\nReliance on Professional Expertise. These domains require extensive\
    \ professional knowledge and\nexperience. The finance domain involves complex\
    \ financial analysis, investment strategies, and economic\nforecasting, necessitating\
    \ deep knowledge of financial theories, market behavior, and fiscal policy (Benninga,\n\
    2014; Fridson & Alvarez, 2022; Roberts, 1959; Geels, 2013; Franses, 1998; Easterly\
    \ & Rebelo, 1993). Healthcare\nrequires specialized knowledge in medical sciences,\
    \ patient care, diagnostics, and treatment planning, and\nprofessionals are trained\
    \ for years in their specific fields (Melnick et al., 2002; Gowda et al., 2014;\
    \ P. Collins,\n1998; Brauer & Ferguson, 2015; Thomas et al., 2022). The legal\
    \ domain demands a thorough understanding\nof legal principles, statutes, case\
    \ law, and judicial procedures, with practitioners spending extensive periods\n\
    in legal education and training (Hart & Green, 2012; Dworkin, 1986; Sunstein,\
    \ 2018; Epstein & Sharkey, 2020;\nFriedman, 2005; Chemerinsky, 2023; MacCormick,\
    \ 1994).The need for profound professional expertise in these\ndomains presents\
    \ significant challenges in equipping LLMs with the requisite knowledge and capabilities\
    \ (Li\net al., 2023d; Xie et al., 2024b; Islam et al., 2023; Nori et al., 2023a;b;\
    \ Tan et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2022; Choi\net al., 2021; Iu & Wong, 2023).\nHighly\
    \ Confidential Data. Unlike many other domains where data might be more public\
    \ or less sensitive,\nfinance, healthcare, and law deal with information that\
    \ is mostly personal and confidential. This brings\nunique challenges for LLM-based\
    \ research, which is essentially data-driven. LLMs must be trained and tested\n\
    in a manner that prevents data breaches or inadvertent disclosures. This necessitates\
    \ research challenges\nsuch as training data synthesis, encryption techniques,\
    \ secure data handling practices, transfer learning, etc.\nExtensive Multimodal\
    \ Documents. The complexity and multimodal nature of documents in these\nsectors\
    \ mark another unique challenge. Financial documents may contain not only text\
    \ but also tables\nand charts in diverse structures (Chen et al., 2021b; Bhatia\
    \ et al., 2024). Healthcare data may contain\ntext and various medical imaging\
    \ modalities Gee et al. (2004); Wood et al. (2020); Yan et al. (2023c),\nsuch\
    \ as X-ray Radiography, Ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance\
    \ Imaging\n(MRI). Legal documents may contain text, images of evidence, audio\
    \ recordings of testimonies, or video\ndepositions (Matoesian & Gilbert, 2018;\
    \ He et al., 2023a). Developing LLMs that can accurately interpret\nand correlate\
    \ information across modalities is crucial, demanding innovative approaches to\
    \ model architecture\nand data processing.\nHigh Legal Risk and Strict Regulations.\
    \ Considering the potential serious consequences of actions\nin finance, healthcare,\
    \ and law,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**:\
