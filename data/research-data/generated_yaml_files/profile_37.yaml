  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and robustness
    of deep neural networks, particularly in resource-constrained environments. My
    work addresses the critical challenges of model size and deployment, especially
    in safety-critical applications. I introduced Deadwooding, a global pruning technique
    that leverages a Lagrangian Dual method to achieve model sparsity without sacrificing
    accuracy or adversarial robustness. This innovation has significantly advanced
    the state-of-the-art in model performance.


    In my pursuit of practical solutions, I developed VeriCompress, an automated tool
    that optimizes the search and training of compressed models with guaranteed robustness.
    This tool not only accelerates training but also ensures that the resulting models
    are suitable for deployment on edge devices, requiring significantly less memory
    and inference time compared to existing methods. My comprehensive evaluations
    across various datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR, demonstrate VeriCompress''s
    effectiveness in identifying robust models tailored for safety-critical applications.


    Additionally, I have explored the realm of human sensing applications, where I
    introduced CRoP, a static personalization approach that optimizes model performance
    by addressing intra-user heterogeneity. This work is particularly relevant in
    clinical settings, where data limitations pose significant challenges. By combining
    pre-trained models with pruning techniques, CRoP enhances personalization and
    generalization, showcasing its potential impact on real-world health applications.
    My research is driven by a commitment to making advanced machine learning techniques

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nDomain shift is a common\
    \ challenge in many real life applications [16]. For ex-\nample, in medical imaging,\
    \ models trained on the data from one institution may\nnot generalize well to\
    \ another institution with different imaging hardware. Sim-\nilarly, in battery\
    \ capacity monitoring, models trained on lab-collected data may\nperform poorly\
    \ under diverse operation environments. Obtaining the annotation\nfor the new\
    \ domains, however, is often very costly or infeasible. To address this\n\u22C6\
    Hanbing Liu, Jingge Wang, Xuan Zhang, and Yang Li are from the Shenzhen Key\n\
    Laboratory of Ubiquitous Data Enabling, SIGS, Tsinghua University.arXiv:2402.16681v2\
    \  [cs.LG]  18 Mar 20242 Hanbing Liu et al.\nchallenge, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\
    \ (UDA) has been proposed, lever-\naging the labeled data from the source domain\
    \ to improve the performance of\nlearning models on the unlabeled target domain\
    \ [5]. In particular, UDA aims\nto align the distributions of the source and target\
    \ domains using labeled source\ndata and unlabeled target data, typically by learning\
    \ domain-invariant represen-\ntations [13] or adversarial learning schemes. Nevertheless,\
    \ one challenge of UDA\nis its limited effectiveness when confronted with significant\
    \ domain shift. Studies\nconducted by Zhao et al. [18] have shed light on the\
    \ relationship between the\ndomain shift and generalization error in UDA. They\
    \ have shown that the effec-\ntiveness of UDA is bounded by the distributional\
    \ divergence between the source\nand target domain, so the performance of the\
    \ adapted model on the target do-\nmain may not be satisfactory with a substantial\
    \ domain shift. In addressing this\nchallenge, many works studied the problem\
    \ of Continuous Domain Adaptation\n(CDA) [17].\nInstead of directly adapting the\
    \ model from the source to the target do-\nmain, CDA captures the underlying domain\
    \ continuity leveraging a stream of\nobserved intermediate domains, and gradually\
    \ bridges the substantial domain\ngap by adapting the model progressively. There\
    \ are various applications of CDA\nrequiring continuous domains with indexed metadata\
    \ [6,9]. For example, in med-\nical data analysis, age acts as a continuous metadata\
    \ for disease diagnosis across\npatients of different age groups. In the online\
    \ battery capacity estimation prob-\nlem, the state of health (SoH) of the battery\
    \ acts as a continuous metadata that\ndiffers across batteries. CDA has attracted\
    \ a great deal of attention and gained\na rapid performance boost by self-training\
    \ [7,19], pseudo-labeling [8], adversar-\nial algorithms, optimal transport (OT)\
    \ [10] and so on. In particular, Oritiz et\nal. [10] designed an efficient forward-backward\
    \ splitting optimization algorithm\nfor continuous optimal transport (COT) and\
    \ demonstrated the efficacy of OT in\nreducing the domain shift and improving\
    \ the performance of adaptation models.\nWhile there have been significant advances\
    \ in CDA, it still faces two critical\nchallenges, determining the transfer order\
    \ of intermediate domains in the ab-\nsence of continuous metadata and mitigating\
    \ cumulative errors throughout the\ncontinuous adaptation process. For the first\
    \ issue, metadata could be missing\nor incorrect, and sometimes metadata alone\
    \ can not fully explain the difference\nbetween data distributions. The proper\
    \ ordering of intermediate domains is sig-\nnificant for CDA in transferring knowledge\
    \ all the way to the target domain.\nIndeed, it is necessary to order the intermediate\
    \ domains to facilitate continu-\nous transfer without relying on explicit metadata.\
    \ As a divergence measurement\nthat takes into account the geometry of the data\
    \ distributions, Wasserstein dis-\ntance (w-distance) [15] plays an important\
    \ role in deriving the generalization\nbound in domain adaptation, which implies\n\
