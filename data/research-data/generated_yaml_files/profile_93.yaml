    enhancing the reliability of computer-aided diagnosis.


    Additionally, I have explored the integration of large language models in medical
    question-answering systems, developing UroBot, a urology-specialized chatbot that
    outperforms existing models and demonstrates clinician-verifiable accuracy. My
    research also investigates the vulnerabilities of vision-language models in healthcare,
    highlighting the need for robust security measures.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and
    practical clinical applications, ultimately improving patient outcomes and fostering
    trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction Modern intrusion detection\
    \ systems leverage Machine Learning (ML) to correlate net-work features, identify\
    \ patterns in data and highlight anomalies corresponding to at-tacks. Security\
    \ researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify\
    \ them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever,\
    \ due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent\
    \ threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems.\
    \ Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to\
    \ new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end\
    \ up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag\
    \ certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to\
    \ explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning\
    \ behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3]\
    \ framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to\
    \ make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess\
    \ password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators\
    \ is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility\
    \ to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation\
    \ matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence.\
    \ Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given,\
    \ the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly\
    \ capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis\
    \ may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can\
    \ provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it.\
    \ It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As\
    \ per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases,\
    \ interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the\
    \ reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval.\
    \ With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model\
    \ into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different\
    \ steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable\
    \ AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help\
    \ to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before\
    \ training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to\
    \ under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning\
    \ the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations\
    \ which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after\
    \ model deployment. Thus, at every stage in ML pipeline these explanations make\
    \ it easier to design and deploy best network intrusion detection system. Figure\
    \ 2 shows how we can generate explanations for every type of user. When any machine\
    \ learning model is deployed into production, three types of users\n\n       \
    \     **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction\
    \ provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state\
