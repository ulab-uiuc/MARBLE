  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing the challenges of data scarcity
    and privacy in the realm of industrial surface defect classification (SDC) and
    fault diagnosis (FD) through innovative applications of federated learning (FL).
    My recent work has focused on developing personalized federated learning approaches,
    such as Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL), which effectively tackle
    data heterogeneity among clients. By employing dynamic consensus construction
    and a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism, I enhance the global model''s generalization
    capabilities while ensuring that local models retain their unique insights.


    Additionally, I have introduced the representation encoding-based federated meta-learning
    (REFML) framework, which leverages the inherent heterogeneity of training clients
    to improve out-of-distribution generalization. This framework not only addresses
    the domain discrepancies that often plague FL but also optimizes the use of limited
    training data across different equipment types. My research has consistently demonstrated
    significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, achieving up to 18.33% better
    performance on unseen equipment types compared to state-of-the-art methods.


    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning techniques
    and real-world industrial applications, ensuring that privacy concerns do not
    hinder the development of robust and effective models. I am passionate about pushing
    the boundaries of federated learning to create solutions that are both innovative
    and practical for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nWith the popularization\
    \ of smartphones, wearable devices, mobile networks, etc., edge devices have become\
    \ ubiquitous in\nmodern society. An effective method to better utilize the abundant\
    \ private data in edge devices without compromising\nprivacy is federated learning,\
    \ which aims to collaboratively train machine learning models while keeping the\
    \ data\ndecentralized [ 226],i.e., following the data-stay-local policy. The participating\
    \ devices in the federated learning system\nare regarded as different clients.\
    \ Federated learning is a distributed machine learning framework with secure encryption\n\
    technology, which enables multiple institutions to conduct joint machine learning\
    \ modeling under the requirement of\nprotecting data privacy [ 67]. Federated\
    \ learning has drawn increasing attention in both academia and industry owing\
    \ to\nits potential utility in large-scale applications [ 48,85,185], which has\
    \ been widely explored in the fields of healthcare\n[39, 178, 214], medical analysis\
    \ [54, 97], and data security [205], etc.\nDespite the great success in homogeneous\
    \ federated learning, where it heavily relies on the assumption that all the\n\
    participants share the same network structure and possess similar data distributions\
    \ [ 123]. However, in practical large-scale\nAuthors\u2019 addresses: Mang Ye,\

    \  [cs.LG]  8 Sep 20232 Ye and Fang, et al.\nsituations, there may be considerable\
    \ differences between data distributions, model structures, communication networks,\n\
    and system edge devices, which make it challenging to realize federated collaboration.\
    \ The federated learning associated\nwith these situations is denoted as heterogeneous\
    \ federated learning, where this heterogeneity can be categorized into\nfour classes\
    \ according to the federated learning process: statistical heterogeneity, model\
    \ heterogeneity, communication\nheterogeneity, and device heterogeneity. These\
    \ are shown in Fig. 1 and detailed as follows. 1) Statistical heterogeneity :\
    \ the\ncollected data in different participants may be Non-Independent Identically\
    \ Distributed (Non-IID) [ 254] or unbalanced,\nresulting in inconsistent update\
    \ optimization directions of participants. Original introduction, and MixUp [\
    \ 189,240].\nAdditional data can also be artificially synthesized using Generative\
    \ Adversarial Networks (GAN) [ 63]. However,\nstatistical heterogeneity of client\
    \ datasets is commonly encountered in federated settings, and private data augmentation\n\
    techniques can be directly used to smooth the data distribution across multiple\
    \ clients and mitigate statistical heterogeneity.\nFederated data augmentation\
    \ typically requires users to upload a few local data samples, which increases\
    \ the risk of data\nprivacy breaches. To circumvent this risk, several approaches\
    \ require a proxy dataset that can represent the overall data\ndistribution of\
    \ a federated system. Owing to these aspects, data augmentation in federated settings\
    \ is highly challenging.\nIn a Non-IID environment with uneven data distributions\
    \ on the clients, Yoon et al. [234] construct a Mean Augmented\nFederated Learning\
    \ (MAFL) framework, in which clients exchange mean local data to obtain global\
    \ information while\nmaintaining privacy requirements. Furthermore, they designed\
    \ a data augmentation algorithm FedMix under the MAFL\nframework, which approximates\
    \ the loss function of the global mixup through Taylor expansion without accessing\
    \ the\nraw data of other clients. Consider the client \U0001D456has a private\
    \ local dataset (\U0001D465\U0001D456,\U0001D466\U0001D456), and\U0001D453(,)is\
    \ the model output. Therefore,\nthe approximated FedMix loss can be expressed\
    \ as:\nL\U0001D439\U0001D452\U0001D451\U0001D440\U0001D456\U0001D465 =(1\u2212\
