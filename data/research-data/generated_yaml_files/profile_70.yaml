  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricacies of graph theory
    and its applications, particularly in the realm of generating structurally diverse
    graphs. My recent work addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding
    the generation of diverse graph structures, which is crucial for testing graph
    algorithms and their neural approximations. I delve into defining what diversity
    means in the context of graphs, recognizing the complexities involved in selecting
    appropriate diversity measures.


    In my research, I have developed and compared various algorithms aimed at optimizing
    graph diversity, including traditional random graph models, local graph optimization
    techniques, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. My findings demonstrate
    that it is indeed possible to enhance diversity beyond what basic random graph
    generators can achieve. Through this work, I have gained valuable insights into
    the properties of graph distances and how different diversity measures can lead
    to graphs with distinct structural characteristics. This research not only contributes
    to the theoretical understanding of graph properties but also has practical implications
    for the development of more robust graph algorithms.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher with a keen interest in algebraic geometry, functional
    analysis, and graph theory. My work primarily revolves around the construction
    of exceptional collections in the bounded derived category of $S_k$-equivariant
    coherent sheaves on projective spaces. I have successfully developed rectangular
    and minimal Lefschetz exceptional collections, particularly in cases involving
    three-dimensional settings and specific conditions on the dimensions of the projective
    spaces.


    In functional analysis, I explore the properties of topological vector spaces
    of holomorphic functions, focusing on the conditions under which polynomial sets
    generate these spaces. My research has led to significant insights into the continuity
    of evaluation functionals and the structure of maximal domains, particularly in
    metrizable spaces.


    Recently, I have ventured into graph theory, addressing the challenge of generating
    structurally diverse graphs. I have defined measures of diversity and proposed
    various algorithms, including genetic and neural generative models, to optimize
    these measures. This work not only enhances our understanding of graph properties
    but also provides valuable tools for testing graph algorithms and their neural
    approximations.

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the fields of network analysis, machine
    learning, and graph-based methodologies. My work primarily focuses on community
    detection, where I have developed innovative techniques for hyperparameter tuning
    without the need for labeled data, significantly enhancing the performance of
    various community detection algorithms. I have also introduced Stochastic Gradient
    Langevin Boosting (SGLB), a robust framework that guarantees global convergence
    for multimodal loss functions, outperforming traditional gradient boosting methods.


    My research extends to the intersection of graph neural networks (GNNs) and gradient
    boosting decision trees (GBDT), where I proposed a novel architecture that leverages
    the strengths of both models to optimize performance on heterogeneous tabular
    data. Additionally, I have explored neural algorithmic reasoning, emphasizing
    the importance of learning algorithms without intermediate supervision, which
    has led to state-of-the-art results in several algorithmic tasks.


    I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification in model predictions,
    especially for gradient boosting models, and have developed a probabilistic ensemble
    framework to derive uncertainty estimates. My work also includes a systematic
    analysis of classification performance measures, leading to the introduction of
    new metrics that satisfy desirable properties for evaluating classification results.

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nDiversity is a criterion\
    \ that is sought after in many areas of machine learning (ml),\nfrom dataset curation\
    \ and generative modeling to reinforcement learning, active\nlearning, and decoding\
    \ algorithms. A lack of diversity in datasets and models can\nhinder the usefulness\
    \ of ml in many critical applications, e.g. scienti\uFB01c discovery. It\nis therefore\
    \ important to be able to measure diversity.\nMany diversity metrics have been\
    \ proposed in ML, but these metrics are often\ndomain-speci\uFB01c and limited\
    \ in \uFB02exibility. These include metrics that de\uFB01ne diversity\nin terms\
    \ of a reference dataset (Heusel et al., 2017; Sajjadi et al., 2018), a pre-\n\
    1Code for calculating the Vendi Score is available at https://github.com/vertaix/Vendi-Score\
    \ .\n2trained classi\uFB01er (Salimans et al., 2016; Srivastava et al., 2017),\
    \ or discrete features,\nlike n-grams (Li et al., 2016). In this paper, we propose\
    \ a general, reference-free\napproach that de\uFB01nes diversity in terms of a\
    \ user-speci\uFB01ed similarity function.\nOur approach is based on work in ecology,\
    \ where biological diversity has been\nde\uFB01ned as the exponential of the entropy\
    \ of the distribution of species within a\npopulation (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006;\
    \ Leinster, 2021). This value can be interpreted\nas the effective number of species\
    \ in the population. To adapt this approach to ML,\nwe de\uFB01ne the diversity\
    \ of a collection of elements x1, . . . , xnas the exponential of\nthe entropy\
    \ of the eigenvalues of the n\x02nsimilarity matrix K, whose entries are\nequal\
    \ to the similarity scores between each pair of elements. This entropy can be\n\
    seen as the von Neumann entropy associated with K(Bengtsson and \u02D9Zyczkowski,\n\
    2017), so we call our metric the Vendi Score , for the von Neumann diversity.\n\
    Contributions. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n\u2022We extend ecological\
    \ diversity to ML, and propose the Vendi Score, a metric for\nevaluating diversity\
    \ in ML. We study the properties of the Vendi Score, which\nprovides us with a\
    \ more formal understanding of desiderata for diversity.\n\u2022We showcase the\
    \ \uFB02exibility and wide applicability of the Vendi Score, char-\nacteristics\
    \ that stem from its sole reliance on the sample to be evaluated for\ndiversity\
    \ and a user-de\uFB01ned similarity function, and highlight the shortcom-\nings\
    \ of existing metrics used to measure diversity in different domains.\n2 Are We\
    \ Measuring Diversity Correctly in ML?\nSeveral existing metrics for diversity\
    \ rely on a reference distribution or dataset.\nThese reference-based metrics\
    \ de\uFB01ne diversity in terms of coverage of the reference.\nThey assume access\
    \ to an embedding function\u2013such as a pretrained Inception\nmodel (Szegedy\
    \ et al., 2016)\u2013that maps samples to real-valued vectors. One example\nof\
    \ a reference-based metric is Fr\xE9chet Inception distance (\uFB01d) (Heusel\
    \ et al., 2017),\nwhich measures the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian\
    \ distributions, one\nGaussian \uFB01t to the embeddings of the reference sample\
    \ and another one \uFB01t to the\nembeddings of the sample to be evaluated for\
    \ diversity. \uFB01d was originally proposed\nfor evaluating image generative\
    \ adversarial networks (gans) but has since been\napplied to text (C\xEDfka et\
    \ al., 2018) and molecules (Preuer et al., 2018) using domain-\nspeci\uFB01c neural\
    \ network encoders. Sajjadi et al. (2018) proposed a two-metric\nevaluation paradigm\
    \ using precision and recall, with precision measuring quality\nand recall measuring\
    \ diversity in terms of coverage of the reference distribution.\nSeveral other\
    \ variations of precision and recall have been proposed (Kynk\xE4\xE4nniemi\n\
    et al., 2019; Simon et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020). Compared to\n\n       \
