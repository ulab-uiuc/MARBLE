  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of cognitive robotics
    and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on enhancing human-robot
    collaboration through explainability and intelligent decision-making. My recent
    work has centered around the development of hybrid learning architectures that
    integrate large language models (LLMs) with knowledge-based systems, enabling
    intelligent agents to automatically expand their semantic lexicons and improve
    communication capabilities.


    One of my key contributions is the HARMONIC framework, which transforms general-purpose
    robots into trusted teammates capable of complex decision-making and natural communication.
    This framework facilitates interoperability between cognitive and tactical layers,
    allowing robots to effectively collaborate in multi-robot tasks. I have also explored
    innovative approaches to multi-robot planning that incorporate metacognition and
    natural language communication, ensuring that robots can explain their actions
    and decisions to human operators.


    In addition, I have investigated decentralized knowledge dissemination in multi-agent
    systems, drawing inspiration from eavesdropping mechanisms in nature. My work
    has demonstrated significant improvements in mission performance and knowledge
    sharing among agents, reducing reliance on direct communication.


    Overall, my research aims to create cognitive agents that not only perform tasks
    efficiently but also provide transparent explanations, fostering trust and collaboration
    in high-stakes environments. I am passionate about bridging the gap between advanced
    AI technologies and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the
    ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic
    environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML),
    where I introduced FALCON and AutoTransfer to streamline the design process and
    improve efficiency in model selection.


    Overall, my goal is to push the boundaries of GNN research, providing innovative
    solutions that not only advance theoretical understanding but also yield practical

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction, their uncanny\nability\
    \ to generate ideas/potential candidate solutions\u2013albeit\nwith no guarantees\
    \ about those guesses\u2013can be valuable in\n5LLM-Modulo Framework for Robust\
    \ Planning\nthe generate-test-critique setups in conjunction with either\nmodel-based\
    \ verifiers or expert humans in the loop. Accord-\ningly, we propose a general\
    \ \u201CLLM-Modulo\u201D framework7.\nWhile we believe that versions of such an\
    \ architecture can be\nof use in a wide variety of planning or reasoning tasks,\
    \ for\nthe sake of concreteness, we will focus on planning tasks,\nespecially\
    \ of the type studied in the automated planning\ncommunity (Ghallab et al., 2004).\n\
    Figure 3 gives a schematic of the LLM-Modulo Frame-\nwork , as we envision it.\
    \ As can be seen readily, the un-\nderlying architecture is a Generate-Test-Critique\
    \ loop, with\nthe LLM generating candidate plans and a bank of critics\ncritiquing\
    \ the candidate. The loop starts with the LLM get-\nting the problem specification\
    \ and generating its first plan\ncandidate.8Note that the plans an LLM helps generate\
    \ in\nthis architecture have soundness guarantees because of the\nexternal sound\
    \ critics. This means that plans coming out\nof such an compound system will constitute\
    \ a better corpus\nof synthetic data for any fine tuning phase carried out to\n\
    improve/customize the LLM\u2019s generation capability. The\ncompleteness of the\
    \ system depends on the LLM\u2019s ability\nto generate all potentially relevant\
    \ candidates.\nDesign Choices: Before going into the details about the\nframework\
    \ and its various modules, it is worth noting\nsome design decisions underlying\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nWe start by noting that the LLM-Modulo architecture\
    \ is a\n\u201CGenerate-Test\u201D one that involves LLMs interacting with the\n\
    external critics/verifiers rather than a LLMs being just front-\nends to external\
    \ solvers. This is a deliberate decision\u2013as this\nallows the LLM to guess/generate\
    \ candidates to satisfy the\ncritics, as against dealing with the expressiveness\
    \ and search\ncomplexity issues of the solvers. The critics/verifiers also\nare\
    \ also more naturally composable than solvers/planners.\nAs we shall see, we do\
    \ allow for constructive critics which\ncan be based on solvers, and provide suggestions\
    \ on specific\nways of extending/modifying the candidate plans.\nSecondly, the\
    \ framework explicitly recognizes that the\nLLMs can generate approximate ideas\
    \ not just about plan\ncandidates, but domain models, problem reduction strate-\n\
    gies, and refinements to the problem specification. The\nframework also recognizes\
    \ that LLMs are good at for-\nmat/syntax changes. Accordingly, the framework lever-\n\
    ages all these abilities of LLMs, letting them play multiple\nroles in planning.\
    \ Finally, the architecture carefully circum-\nscribes the human\u2019s role\u2013\
    domain experts interact with the\nLLM to tease out the models used by (some of)\
    \ the critics,\nwhile end users take part in refining any incomplete prob-\n7The\
    \ name LLM-Modulo is inspired by the SAT-Modulo theo-\nries (Nieuwenhuis & Oliveras,\
    \ 2006).\n8Although we focus on planning from scratch, it is easy to\naccommodate\
    \ replanning scenarios, where the loop starts with an\nexternally supplied candidate\
    \ plan.lem specification in concert with the LLM. A notable, and\ndeliberate,\
    \ absence is human\u2019s involvement in the inner loop\nof planning\u2013e.g.\
    \ with iterative prompting. In addition to\nposing an infeasible burden on the\
    \ human\u2019s time for com-\nplex planning problems, such iterative prompting\
    \ strategies\nare notorious for their Clever Hans effect (cle).\n3.1. Critics/Verifers\n\
    In the LLM-Modulo framework, critics can evaluate LLM-\ngenerated candidates for\
    \ a planning/reasoning problem over\nboth hard and soft (style) constraints. Hard\
    \ constraints refer\nto correctness verification which can include causal correct-\n\
    ness, timeline correctness, resource constraint correctness\nas well as unit tests.\
    \ For PDDL planning problems, the\nhard critic can be based\n\n            **Your\
