  profile: "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the study of information cascades\
    \ and graph neural networks (GNNs). My work primarily focuses on understanding\
    \ the dynamics of information diffusion in social networks, where I developed\
    \ the FScaleCP framework to predict cascade dynamics in real-time, moving beyond\
    \ traditional methods that only assess final cascade sizes. \n\nIn addition to\
    \ cascade dynamics, I have explored the interpretability of GNNs through my novel\
    \ method, GraphGI, which identifies key interactions within graphs to explain\
    \ model predictions. I believe that understanding the underlying mechanisms of\
    \ GNNs is crucial for their application in safety-critical scenarios, which led\
    \ me to investigate their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. My research\
    \ has yielded guidelines for enhancing GNN robustness and introduced the concept\
    \ of model repair through GraphMU, a framework designed to fine-tune poisoned\
    \ GNNs without complete retraining.\n\nMoreover, I have contributed to the field\
    \ of link prediction by proposing GraphLP, a generative approach that leverages\
    \ network reconstruction theory to improve link prediction accuracy. My work emphasizes\
    \ the importance of understanding network structures and dynamics, aiming to bridge\
    \ theoretical insights with practical applications in areas such as viral marketing\
    \ and rumor prevention. Through my research, I strive to advance the capabilities\
    \ of GNNs while ensuring their reliability and interpretability in real-world\
    \ applications."

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the interpretability of Graph
    Neural Networks (GNNs), a field that has seen remarkable growth and application
    across various domains. My recent work focuses on addressing the black-box nature
    of GNNs, which often obscures the mechanisms behind their predictions. I developed
    a novel explanatory method called GraphGI, which identifies the coalition of nodes
    and edges with the highest interaction strength to create an explanatory subgraph.
    This approach leverages game-theoretic principles to assess how different features
    interact, rather than treating them in isolation.


    Through GraphGI, I aim to provide clearer insights into model predictions by gradually
    incorporating significant edges into the subgraph, ensuring that each addition
    maximizes interaction strength. My method not only enhances the fidelity and sparsity
    of explanations but also maintains a level of interpretability that is crucial
    for practical applications. By employing effective approximation techniques for
    calculating Shapley values, I strive to make the process computationally efficient
    while delivering meaningful insights. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex
    GNN models and their users, fostering a deeper understanding of how these powerful
    tools make decisions.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of temporal action
    segmentation (TAS) and abstractive dialog summarization. My recent work focuses
    on addressing the challenges of few-shot TAS, where I developed an efficient framework
    that includes a novel data augmentation method based on motion interpolation.
    This approach significantly increases the number of available samples by synthesizing
    action sequences, while my integration of a Connectionist Temporal Classification
    (CTC) layer enhances the temporal alignment of predictions, leading to improved
    segmentation performance.


    In addition to TAS, I am passionate about dialog summarization, particularly in
    real-world applications like customer service and healthcare. Recognizing the
    lack of suitable datasets for this task, I created an abstractive dialog summarization
    dataset based on MultiWOZ. To tackle the unique challenges of summarizing dialogues,
    I introduced the Scaffold Pointer Network (SPNet), which leverages semantic scaffolds
    to preserve critical entities and ensure coherence across different dialog domains.
    My work has demonstrated significant improvements over existing methods, as evidenced
    by superior performance on both automatic and human evaluation metrics.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements
    and practical applications, ultimately contributing to more effective and efficient

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nGraph Neural Networks\
    \ (GNNs) are powerful models to learn rep-\nresentations of graph-structured data\
    \ such as social [ 6,23,41],\nbiological [ 7,27], and chemical [ 4,20,43] networks.\
    \ By capturing\ngraph structures and node/edge features in an embedding space,\n\
    GNNs achieved state-of-the-art performance on various tasks such\nas node classi\uFFFF\
    cation, link prediction, graph classi\uFFFFcation, and rec-\nommendation [ 11,15,39,42].\
    \ As with most deep learning models,\na GNN represents a complex encoding function\
    \ whose outputs can-\nnot be easily explained by its inputs (graph structure and\
    \ features).\nAs GNNs are widely used in scienti\uFFFFc and business applications,\
    \ un-\nderstanding their predictions based on the input graph is necessary\nto\
    \ gain users\u2019 trust in the model.\nLike other branches of machine learning\
    \ [ 18,28,33,37], sev-\neral e\uFFFFective GNN explanation experiments\nfor the\
    \ model in Section 4.2, baselines, and their parameters in Sec-\ntion 4.4. GNNShap-speci\uFFFF\

    \ Let \02R#\u21E5#be the sparse adjacency\nmatrix of the graph where \089=1if{E8,E9}2\u21E2\
    , otherwise \089=0.\nAdditionally, -2R#\u21E53denotes the node feature matrix.\
    \ Without\nloss of generality, we consider node classi\uFFFFcation tasks where\
    \ each\nnode is mapped to one of Cclasses. If 5is a trained GNN model,\nthe predicted\
    \ class for a node Eis given by \u02C6~=5(\0, -, E ).\n2.1 Graph Neural Networks\n\
    GNNs use a message-passing scheme in which each layer ;has\nthree main computations\
    \ [ 3,51,52]. The \uFFFFrst step propagates\nmessages between the node pairs\u2019\

    \ A89between the nodes @;\n89=\nMSG (\u2318;\01\n8,\u2318;\01\n9,A89). The second\
    \ step aggregates messages for each\nnode E8from its neighbors NE8:&;\n8=AGG ({@;\n\
    89|E92N E8}). The\n\uFFFFnal step of the GNN transforms the aggregated message\
    \ and E8\u2019s\nprevious representation \u2318;\01\n8via a non-linear transform\
    \ function\nand updates the representation: \u2318;\n8=UPD (&;\n8,\u2318;\01\n\

    \ Eincludes all information\nthat a GNN model 5needs to predict \u02C6~forE. For\
