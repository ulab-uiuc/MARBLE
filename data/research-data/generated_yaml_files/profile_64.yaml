    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nThe surge in IoT devices\
    \ has unlocked vast potential for leveraging\nedge-generated data in driving cooperative\
    \ computing applications\nsuch as autonomous vehicles, video analytics, and recommenda-\n\
    tion systems. Traditionally, the centralized training process raises\n.significant\
    \ data privacy and security concerns due to the neces-\nsity of transferring local\
    \ information. Federated learning (FL), as\nintroduced by [ 31], offers a solution\
    \ to these privacy challenges\nby enabling collaborative model training across\
    \ numerous clients\nunder the orchestration of a central server, without sharing\
    \ the\nraw data. FL systems bring obvious advantages by involving clients\ndownloading\
    \ a global model, performing local updates using their\ndata, and then sending\
    \ these updates back to the server. The server\naggregates these updates to enhance\
    \ the global model, thereby\npreserving data privacy. Aside from the privacy considerations\n\
    mentioned above, there are two fundamental acknowledgements\nabout (cross-device)\
    \ federated learning which have been widely\nrecognized: data heterogeneity among\
    \ clients and the limited and\ndiverse computational resources on local devices\
    \ [18, 30, 31, 52].\nData heterogeneity represents a significant challenge in\
    \ feder-\nated learning. It largely stems from the fact that the data across\n\
    participating clients are distributed independently, with each client\nhaving\
    \ a different sample distribution. Due to the diversity in clients\u2019\ndatasets.\
    \ these datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, lead-\ning to client\
    \ models that are biased toward the more common classes\n[36,43]. This discrepancy\
    \ often results, particularly for classes with few\ndata. Compared to classes\
    \ with abundant data, those with fewer\ninstances often experience misclassification,\
    \ with minority class\ndata being inaccurately labeled as belonging to majority\
    \ classes.\nThis starkly underscores the significance of our global alignment\n\
