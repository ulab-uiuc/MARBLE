  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of tabular and
    graph machine learning, with a focus on enhancing predictive performance through
    the integration of graph-based methods. My work addresses the unique challenges
    posed by heterogeneous tabular data, where I have developed a benchmark that evaluates
    various models, including graph neural networks (GNNs) and traditional tabular
    models. Through empirical studies, I have demonstrated that GNNs can significantly
    improve predictive outcomes, while also revealing that with appropriate feature
    preprocessing, standard tabular models can compete effectively.


    In addition to this, I am deeply invested in the problem of out-of-distribution
    (OOD) detection in graph classification. My research emphasizes the importance
    of uncertainty estimation and highlights the lack of a universal solution for
    OOD detection, advocating for a nuanced approach that considers both graph representations
    and predictive distributions.


    Furthermore, I have proposed a novel methodology for inducing diverse distributional
    shifts based on graph structure, which allows for a more comprehensive evaluation
    of graph models under challenging conditions. My findings indicate that simple
    models can often outperform more complex ones in these scenarios, revealing a
    critical trade-off between representation quality and the ability to distinguish
    between different distributions.


    Overall, my research aims to bridge the gap between tabular and graph machine
    learning, providing insights and methodologies that enhance the robustness and
    reliability of machine learning systems in real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricacies of graph neural
    networks (GNNs) and their application to both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.
    My recent work has focused on addressing the challenges posed by heterophily in
    graph structures, where I have critically examined existing homophily measures
    and proposed the adjusted homophily metric, which offers a more reliable comparison
    across datasets. Additionally, I introduced the concept of label informativeness
    (LI), which provides deeper insights into how neighbor labels influence node predictions,
    demonstrating its correlation with GNN performance.


    Recognizing the gap between tabular and graph machine learning, I have developed
    a benchmark that integrates heterogeneous tabular node features into graph models.
    This work highlights the potential of GNNs to enhance predictive performance in
    tabular contexts while also revealing that traditional tabular models can be adapted
    to leverage graph data effectively.


    Challenging the prevailing notion that GNNs are limited to homophilous graphs,
    I have shown that standard GNN architectures can perform robustly on heterophilous
    datasets, even outperforming specialized models. My research aims to bridge the
    divide between theoretical advancements and practical applications, providing
    valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the fields of graph
    and tabular machine learning.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the fields of network analysis, machine
    learning, and graph-based methodologies. My work primarily focuses on community
    detection, where I have developed innovative techniques for hyperparameter tuning
    without labeled data, significantly enhancing the performance of various community
    detection algorithms. I have also introduced Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting
    (SGLB), a robust framework that guarantees global convergence for multimodal loss
    functions, outperforming traditional gradient boosting methods.


    My research extends to the intersection of graph neural networks (GNNs) and gradient-boosted
    decision trees (GBDT), where I proposed a novel architecture that leverages the
    strengths of both models to handle heterogeneous tabular data effectively. Additionally,
    I have explored neural algorithmic reasoning, emphasizing the importance of learning
    algorithms without intermediate supervision, which has led to state-of-the-art
    results in several algorithmic tasks.


    I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification in model predictions,
    especially for gradient boosting models, and have developed a probabilistic ensemble-based
    framework to derive uncertainty estimates. My work also includes a systematic
    analysis of classification performance measures, leading to the introduction of
    new metrics that better evaluate classification results.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    contributing to the understanding and advancement of machine learning and network

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nRelational databases\
    \ (RDBs) can be viewed as storing a collection\nof interrelated data spread across\
    \ multiple linked tables. Of vast\nand steadily growing importance, the market\
    \ for RDB management\nsystems alone is expected to exceed $133 billion USD by\
    \ 2028 [ 56].\nEven so, while the machine learning community has devoted con-\n\
    siderable attention to predictive tasks involving single tables, or\nso-called\
    \ tabular modeling tasks [ 21,49,58], thus far efforts to\nwiden the scope to\
    \ handle multiple tables and RDBs still lags be-\nhind, despite the seemingly\
    \ enormous potential of doing so. With\n\u2217Equal contribution. Corresponding\
    \ authors: {minjiw,quagan}@amazon.com\n\u2020Work done during an internship in\
    \ Amazon Web Services.respect to the latter, in many real-world scenarios critical\
    \ features\nneeded for accurately modeling a given quantity of interest are not\n\
    constrained to a single table [ 9,14], nor can be easily flattened into\na single\
    \ table via reliable/obvious feature engineering [15].\nThis disconnect between\
    \ commercial opportunity and academic\nresearch focus can, at least in large part,\
    \ be traced back to one trans-\nparent culprit: Unlike widely-studied computer\
    \ vision [ 16], natural\nlanguage processing [ 67], tabular [ 28], and graph [\
    \ 35] domains,\nestablished benchmarks for evaluating predictive ML models of\n\
    RDB data are much less prevalent. This reality is an unsurprising\nconsequence\
    \ of privacy concerns and the typical storage of RDBs\non servers with heavily\
    \ restrictive access and/or licensing protec-\ntions. With few exceptions (that\
    \ will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead\
    \ predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first\
    \ branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information\
    \ are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks\
    \ (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\n\
    specifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that\
    \ performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge\
    \ features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table\
    \ format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\n\
    on the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to\
    \ produce the provided graphs and features. As for the\nsecond branch, emphasis\
    \ is placed on tabular model evaluations\nthat preserve the original format of\
    \ single table data, possibly with\naugmentations collected from auxiliary tables.\
    \ But here feature\nengineering and table flattening are typically prioritized\
    \ over ex-\nploiting rich network effects as with GNNs [ 9,14,47,48]. Critically\n\
    though, currently-available head-to-head comparisons involving\ndiverse candidate\
    \ approaches representative of both branches on\nun-filtered RDB/multi-table data\
    \ are insufficient for drawing clear-\ncut conclusions regarding which might be\
    \ preferable and under\nwhat particular circumstances.\nTo address the aforementioned\
    \ limitations and help advance\npredictive modeling over RDB data, in Section\
    \ 2 we first introduce\na generic supervised learning formulation across both\
    \ inductive\nand transductive settings covering dynamic RDBs as commonly-\nencountered\
    \ in practice. A given predictive pipeline is then specified\nby (i) a sampling/distillation\
