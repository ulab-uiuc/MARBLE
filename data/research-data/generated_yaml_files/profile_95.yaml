  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the diagnostic processes for
    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through the application of deep learning techniques
    in medical imaging. My work focuses on addressing the challenges associated with
    traditional diagnostic methods, which often rely on subjective clinical assessments
    that can lead to biases and delays in diagnosis. Recognizing the critical need
    for objective biomarkers, I have developed a deep learning model that not only
    accurately classifies ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    (fMRI) data but also provides interpretable insights into its decision-making
    process.


    Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
    (ABIDE), my research highlights key brain regions that differentiate individuals
    with ASD from typical controls. This interpretability is crucial, as it not only
    enhances diagnostic accuracy but also contributes to a deeper understanding of
    the neural underpinnings of ASD. My findings have been validated across various
    studies and datasets, reinforcing the robustness of the model and its potential
    for real-world application in early diagnosis.


    Through my work, I aim to advance the field of explainable AI in medical imaging,
    paving the way for more objective and reliable diagnostic tools for ASD. I am
    passionate about bridging the gap between technology and clinical practice to
    improve the quality of life for individuals on the autism spectrum.'

  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities during the aggregation
    process.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the
    ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic
    environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML),
    where I introduced methods like FALCON and AutoTransfer to improve the efficiency
    of model design searches by leveraging prior knowledge across tasks.


    Overall, my work aims to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications,
    providing scalable solutions that push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve
    in real-world scenarios. I am passionate about continuing to explore this dynamic

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nDeep learning models\
    \ are now being widely deployed,\nnotably in safety-critical applications such\
    \ as autonomous\ndriving. In such contexts, their black-box nature is a major\n\
    concern, and explainability Background and Related Work\nLocal explanations. The\
    \ overwhelming majority of deep\nlearning based models are designed without explainability\n\
    in mind, with only a few notable exceptions [8, 64]. This\nfact has prompted an\
    \ interest in post-hoc explanations of\nalready trained models that can be useful\
    \ to analyze cor-\nner cases, understand failures, and find biases [15, 40].\n\
    In safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving or\nmedical imaging,\
    \ explanations are especially needed for li-\nability purposes and to foster end-user\
    \ trust [45, 49, 62, 65].\nPost-hoc explanations are global if they provide a\
    \ holis-\ntic view of the main decision factors driving the model\n[18, 21, 32,\
    \ 33], or they are local if they target the under-\nstanding of the model behavior\
    \ on a specific input [40, 44].\nHistorically, the vast majority of local explanation\
    \ meth-\nods are attribution-based: they generate saliency maps high-lighting\
    \ pixels or regions influencing the most the model\u2019s\ndecision [5, 16, 39,\
    \ 44, 47, 53, 56, 63, 67]. In the case of ur-\nban scenes, a saliency method would\
    \ for instance point at\nthe traffic light, or the presence of a pedestrian to\
    \ explain\nwhy a driving model stops [31, 43]. However, saliency ex-\nplanations\
    \ may be misleading as they can be independent\nof the model at hand and merely\
    \ act as edge detectors [3].\nBesides, saliency results are very counter-intuitive\
    \ because one would expect that\n\u2019can\u2019t turn right\u201D should be the\
    \ answer if there is a car or an obstacle\non the right (not on the left)\nbecause\
    \ the right lane is occupied The presence of a double yellow line on the right\
    \ prohibits turning right I did not understand many examples where there was no\
    \ double line and\nwhere the right lane seemed clear and where, however, turning\
    \ right was\nprohibited.\nCan\u2019t turn right when front vehicle is close and\
    \ when there is a car on\ntheleftor on the rightInflucene the decision : Yellow\
    \ line, distance with the front car, position\nof vehicles on the right or on\
    \ the left.The model does not consider the lateral space on the right side.\n\
    The car in front is too close, and there is a car on the right To be able to overtake,\
    \ we must not have cars overtaking us, nor cars that\nare too close, if possible\
    \ good general visibility, in particular lines.No\nThere is a car too the right\
    \ which is close. It does not want to turn when there is a car to the left Yes,\
    \ as said before\nThere is no car on the left, no double yellow can be seen if\
    \ the model detects an object car-shaped on the left, a double yellow\nline on\
    \ the ground, or a long and large object to the ground on the right\nit doesn\u2019\
    t turn rightit\u2019s decisions do not seem correct regarding driving ability\n\
    Car ahead too close - double yellow lines: no turn - cars on the left: no turn\
    \ - car ahead too\nclose: no turn - need a car ahead to evaluate if there is the\
    \ space to turn\nrightcars on the leftline: no tun - need a car ahead to evaluate\
    \ if the road is\nlarge enought to\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n          \
