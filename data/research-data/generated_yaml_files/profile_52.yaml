  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the intersection of molecular
    representation learning and graph neural networks (GNNs). My recent work emphasizes
    the importance of fine-grained molecular motifs in understanding molecular properties,
    leading to the development of FineMolTex, a framework that integrates both coarse
    and fine-grained knowledge through innovative pre-training tasks. This approach
    has shown remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, particularly in drug discovery.


    I have also explored the challenges of graph contrastive learning (GCL), proposing
    the PrOvable Training (POT) method to address imbalances in node training. My
    research extends to ensuring fairness in pre-trained graph models (PGMs) through
    the GraphPAR framework, which enhances model fairness without compromising performance.


    Recognizing the vulnerabilities of GNNs to adversarial attacks, I have investigated
    the potential of large language models (LLMs) to bolster GNN robustness. My work
    on LLM4RGNN demonstrates how LLMs can enhance graph structure inference, improving
    GNN resilience against topology attacks.


    Additionally, I introduced GraphTranslator, a novel approach that bridges GNNs
    and LLMs, enabling them to tackle both predefined and open-ended tasks effectively.
    My ongoing research aims to define and explore Graph Foundation Models (GFMs),
    a new paradigm in graph machine learning that leverages the strengths of foundation
    models for diverse graph tasks.


    Through my work, I strive to push the boundaries of graph learning, making significant
    contributions to both theoretical understanding and practical applications in
    the field.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of quantum mechanics,
    graph theory, and machine learning, with a particular focus on enhancing the capabilities
    of quantum parameter estimation and graph neural networks (GNNs). My recent work
    explores the nuances of quantum sensing in dissipative environments, revealing
    how non-Markovian effects can significantly boost estimation precision. I have
    also pioneered methods that leverage thermodynamic criticality to enhance quantum
    sensing at finite temperatures, expanding the boundaries of quantum metrology.


    In the realm of graph neural networks, I have developed innovative frameworks
    such as GraLSP, which integrates local structural patterns into neighborhood aggregation,
    and CaGCN, a model designed for confidence calibration in GNNs. My research addresses
    critical issues like structural unfairness in GNNs, proposing solutions that enhance
    representation learning for low-degree nodes. I have also contributed to the field
    of heterogeneous information networks through the RHINE model, which tailors embedding
    strategies to different types of relationships, and HeCo, a self-supervised learning
    mechanism that captures both local and high-order structures.


    My work is driven by a commitment to bridging theoretical insights with practical
    applications, as evidenced by my exploration of causal relationships in dynamic
    graphs and the development of frameworks that facilitate knowledge distillation
    in semi-supervised learning. I am passionate about advancing our understanding
    of complex systems and improving the performance and fairness of machine learning
    models in real-world applications.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nMolecular Relational\
    \ Learning (MRL) (Lee et al.,\n2023a), aiming to understand interactions between\n\
    molecular pairs , has gained significant interest\ndue to its wide range of applications\
    \ (Roden\net al., 2020). For example, Drug-Drug Interactions\n*Equal contribution.\n\
    \u2020Corresponding author. Xiang Wang is also affiliated with\nInstitute of Dataspace,\
    \ Hefei Comprehensive National Science\nCenter.(DDIs) are critical in pharmacology\
    \ and drug de-\nvelopment (Lin et al., 2020), while solute-solvent\ninteractions\
    \ (SSIs) are fundamental in solution\nchemistry and the design of chemical processes\n\
    (Varghese and Mushrif, 2019; Chung et al., 2022).\nHowever, the exhaustive experimental\
    \ validation of\nthese interactions is notoriously time-consuming\nand costly.\
    \ In response, adopting large language\nmodels (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Taylor\
    \ et al.,\n2022), known for their vast knowledge repositories\nand advanced logical\
    \ inference capabilities, has\nemerged as an efficient and effective alternative\
    \ for\nMRL (Park et al., 2022; Jha et al., 2022a).\nDespite their promise, a primary\
    \ concern of cur-\nrent LLM-based paradigm is the insufficient data\nexploitation\
    \ . Specifically, they predominantly rely\non the textual data such as SMILES\
    \ (Simplified\nMolecular Input Line Entry System) and property\ndescriptions,\
    \ thus not fully harnessing the wealth of\nstructural information inherent in\
    \ molecular graphs\n(Sagawa and Kojima, 2023), as indicated in Figure\n1 (a).\
    \ Current studies have indicated that it is chal-\nlenging for LLMs to fully understand\
    \ the complex\ngraphs based solely on textual data, hence, it\u2019s cru-\ncial\
    \ to explicitly model these structures given their\nsignificance in MRL (Park\
    \ et al., 2022).\nCompounding this concern is the absence of a\nunified framework\
    \ for LLM-based MRL (Livne\net al., 2023; Pei et al., 2023). Concretely, this\
    \ ab-\nsence impedes the sharing and integration of inter-\naction mechanisms\
    \ learned across various datasets,\nleading to a fragmentation in collective insights.\
    \ Es-\npecially, it poses a catastrophic challenge for tasks\nwith a limited number\
    \ of labeled pairs (Chung et al.,\n2022), where LLMs often struggle with due to\
    \ the\nhigh risk of overfitting, as illustrated in Figure 1\n(b). Worse still,\
    \ such limited datasets are prevalent\nin MRL since the experimental acquisition\
    \ is often\nconstrained by high costs (Lee et al., 2023a).\nTo overcome these\
    \ limitations, in this work,\nwe propose MolTC , a unified multi-modal frame-arXiv:2402.03781v6\
