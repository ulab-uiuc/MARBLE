  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nText-to-image\
    \ generative models have witnessed significant advancements in recent years [1,\
    \ 2, 3, 4]. When presented with appropriate textual prompts, they are capable\
    \ of generating high-fidelity images that are semantically coherent with the provided\
    \ descriptions, which spans a diverse range of topics, piquing significant public\
    \ interest in their potential applications and societal implications. Existing\
    \ self-supervised pre-trained generators, although advanced, still exhibit imperfections,\
    \ with a significant challenge being their alignment with human preferences [5].\n\
    \n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has established itself as\
    \ a pivotal research endeavor, demonstrating notable efficacy in aligning text-to-image\
    \ models with human preferences [6, 7, 8]. Faced with the intricate challenge\
    \ of defining an objective that authentically encapsulates human preferences in\
    \ the realm of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), researchers\
    \ conventionally assemble a dataset to mirror such preferences through comparative\
    \ assessments of model-generated outputs [6, 9]. Then, a reward model is trained\
    \ based on Bradley-Terry model [10], inferring human preferences from the collected\
    \ dataset. And the text-to-image model is fine-tuned with a reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL) pipeline. It is noteworthy that such process is conducted while ensuring\
    \ the model remains closely with its original form, which is achieved by employing\
    \ a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty. Significant complexity has been\
    \ introduced to the RLHF pipeline due to the requirement to train a separate reward\
    \ model, even though it is somewhat effective. Moreover, Reinforcement learning\
    \ pipelines also present notable challenges in terms of stability and memory demands\
    \ towards alignment process of text-to-image models.\n\n\nRecent research has\
    \ demonstrated significant success in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)\
    \ using methods based on implicit rewards, specially the Direct Preference Optimization\
    \ (DPO) [11]. Application of similar fine-tuning techniques to text-to-image models\
    \ has also produced promising results, such as Diffusion-DPO [12], D3PO [13].\
    \ Such results have raisen significant interest within the community regarding\
    \ the alignment of text-to-image models with human value through the methodology\
    \ of utilizing implicit rewards. Furthermore, researchers have devoted significant\
    \ efforts to applying such paradigm of aligning human value to text-to-image models,\
    \ including SPO [14], NCPPO [15], DNO[16], and so on. However, it is the situation\
    \ that existing research of text-to-image generation alignment predominantly targets\
    \ solutions subject to the constraint of the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence,\
    \ with notable underexploitation of strategies that integrate other types of divergences.\n\
    \n\nIt has been pointed out that models would overfit due to repeated fine-tuning\
    \ on a few images, thus leading to reduced output diversity [17]. In the alignment\
    \ of large language models, similar challenges exist; and some studies [18, 19]\
    \ have highlighted that the mode-seeking property of reverse KL divergence tends\
    \ to reduce diversity in generated outputs, which can constrain the model\u2019\
    s potential. Studies on aligning large language models [20, 21] indicate that\
    \ the problem of diversity reduction caused by fine-tuning can be alleviated by\
    \ incorporating diverse divergence constraints. Therefore, in this study, we also\
    \ explore the effects of employing diverse divergence constraints on the generation\
    \ diversity.\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of image generated by the model aligned using\
    \ the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint.\n\n\nIn this study, we generalize\
    \ the alignment of text-to-image models based on reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence\
