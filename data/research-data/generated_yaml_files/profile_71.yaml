  profile: "I am a researcher deeply engaged in the development of advanced generative\
    \ models and statistical methodologies within the realm of machine learning. My\
    \ recent work focuses on conditional generative models, particularly through the\
    \ lens of Schr\xF6dinger bridge-based methods, which allow for efficient and high-quality\
    \ data synthesis. I have pioneered techniques that leverage stochastic differential\
    \ equations to transform fixed points into desired target distributions, demonstrating\
    \ significant improvements in sample quality over existing methods.\n\nMy research\
    \ also delves into the challenges of signal recovery and classification in high-dimensional\
    \ spaces. I have analyzed the performance of LASSO and other large-margin classifiers,\
    \ establishing phase transition boundaries that inform optimal model selection\
    \ and tuning. My work employs innovative statistical techniques, including the\
    \ replica method from statistical physics, to derive asymptotic expressions that\
    \ enhance our understanding of classifier behavior in complex data environments.\n\
    \nAdditionally, I have contributed to the field of clustering, particularly in\
    \ high-dimensional settings, by improving the statistical significance of clustering\
    \ methods through novel eigenvalue estimation techniques. This work has practical\
    \ implications in bioinformatics, where accurate clustering can lead to significant\
    \ discoveries.\n\nOverall, my research aims to bridge theoretical advancements\
    \ with practical applications, providing robust tools and insights for tackling\
    \ complex data challenges in machine learning and statistics."

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nWith the rapid advancements\
    \ in data storage technology and the accessibility of more\npowerful computing\
    \ resources, our human society is taking significant strides into the era of\n\
    Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent influential Artificial General Intelligence\
    \ (AGI) products,\nlike ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and Sora have demonstrated\
    \ remarkable capabilities in\n1arXiv:2402.01460v2  [stat.ML]  13 Jun 2024generating\
    \ high-quality text, image, or video content based on user-provided prompts,\n\
    which are making a revolutionary shift in the way we live and work. Notably, Statistics\n\
    plays a crucial role in the development of these AGI products. A fundamental statistical\n\
    problem involved is how to generate samples efficiently following a learned high-dimensional\n\
    conditional distribution (Liu et al., 2024; Esser et al., 2024).\nIntuitively,\
    \ to solve this fundamental statistical problem, we can first estimate the con-\n\
    ditional distribution and then generate samples from the obtained estimation.\
    \ A wealth\nof classical literature has already delved into nonparametric conditional\
    \ distribution esti-\nmation, including smoothing discussion, which establishes\
    \ the validity of Al-\ngorithm 1 in sampling data from px|y(x|y), and also highlights\
    \ the effectiveness of the\nconditional F\xA8 ollmer flow in sampling from the\
    \ target conditional density.\nTheorem 2 Let Assumptions 1\u20133hold. Suppose\
    \ we have i.i.d. samples {(Xi,Yi)}n\ni=1\n\u223Cpx,y(x,y). We choose the hypothesis\
    \ network class FNN = FNN( L, M, J, K, \u03BA, \u03B3 1, \u03B32, \u03B33)\nas\
    \ specified in Proposition 2and then use \u02C6v(x,y, t)in(7)to estimate the true\
    \ velocity field\nvF(x,y, t). For any fixed (dx, dy), when implementing Algorithm\
    \ 1for sampling pseudo\ndata with (T, N)satisfying (10), we have\nZ\nW2\n2\0\u02DC\
    pT(x;y), px|y(x|y)\x01py(y) dy\u21920\nin probability as n\u2192 \u221E .\n5 Numerical\
    \ Studies\nIn this section, we carry out numerical results, we introduce an auxiliary\n\
    proposition, which characterizes the regularity properties of the conditional\
    \ F\xA8 ollmer velocity\nfieldvF. The proof of Proposition P1 can be found in\
    \ Section C.\nProposition P1 Let Assumptions 1and2hold. The following two assertions\
    \ are satisfied:\n(i)There exists some universal constant C >1independent of (dx,\
    \ R, T )such that\nsup\nt\u2208[0,T]sup\nx\u2208[\u2212R,R]dxsup\ny\u2208[0,B]dy|vF(x,y,\
    \ t)|\u221E\u22641 +TR\n1\u2212T2,\nS1sup\nt\u2208[0,T]sup\nx\u2208[\u2212R,R]dxsup\n\
    y\u2208[0,B]dy|\u2202tvF(x,y, t)|2\u2264Cd3/2\nx(R+ 1)\n(1\u2212T)3,\nfor any\
    \ R >0andT\u2208(0,1).\n(ii)For any y\u2208[0, B]dyandt\u2208[0, T]with T\u2208\
    (0,1),vF(x,y, t)isdx(1\u2212T)\u22122-\nLipschitz continuous w.r.t. x, while Ft(x,y)isexp{dx(1\u2212\
    T)\u22122}-Lipschitz continuous\nw.r.t. x.\nA Proof of Theorem 1\nWe will establish\
    \ our proof of Theorem 1 through the following three steps.\nStep 1. For any given\
    \ yand\u03B5\u2208(0,1), we show the existence of a diffusion process\n(\xAFZy\n\
    t)t\u2208[0,1\u2212\u03B5]determined by an It\u02C6 o SDE, which can approximately\
    \ transform the target\nconditional density px|y(x|y) into the density of standard\
    \ Gaussian distribution N(0,Idx),\nand then there exists a process ( \u02C7Zy\n\
    t)t\u2208[\u03B4,1\u2212\u03B5]determined by the associated ODE with any\n\u03B4\
    \u2208(0,1) satisfying \u03B4 <1\u2212\u03B5, such that \u02C7Zy\ntshares the\
    \ same marginal density with \xAFZy\ntfor\nanyt\u2208[\u03B4,1\u2212\u03B5].\n\
    Step 2. Under Assumption 2, we can extend the domain of the ODE involved in\n\
    Step 1 to the interval [ \u03B4,1] by supplementing its definition at t= 1, ensuring\
    \ an accurate\ntransformation into the density of standard Gaussian distribution\
    \ N(0,Idx).\nStep 3. Under Assumptions 2, we can prove that the ODE involved in\
    \ Step 2 has\na unique solution. Hence, we can time reverse it to obtain the conditional\
    \ F\xA8 ollmer flow\n(1) over [0 ,1\u2212\u03B4] and further extend it to [0 ,1)\
    \ by letting \u03B4\u21920. This establishes the\nwell-posedness of the conditional\
    \ F\xA8 ollmer flow and its ability to arbitrarily approach the\ntarget conditional\
    \ density px|y(x|y) from the density of the standard Gaussian distribution\nN(0,Idx).\n\
    S2A.1 Step 1\nFor any given yand\u03B5\u2208(0,1), we consider a diffusion process\
