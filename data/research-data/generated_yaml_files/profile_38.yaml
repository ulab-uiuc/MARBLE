  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intricacies of sample compression
    theory and its implications for machine learning, particularly in the context
    of deep learning. My recent work focuses on developing a comprehensive framework
    for deriving sample compression bounds that extend beyond the traditional zero-one
    loss, allowing for real-valued losses. This advancement is crucial as it addresses
    the limitations of existing methods, particularly when applied to complex models
    like neural networks and decision forests.


    Through my research, I have empirically validated the tightness and versatility
    of these new bounds, demonstrating their effectiveness across various model types.
    I am particularly excited about the Pick-To-Learn (P2L) meta-algorithm, which
    I have integrated into my work to transform training methods into sample-compressed
    predictors. My goal is to provide robust generalization guarantees that can enhance
    the performance and efficiency of machine learning models, ultimately contributing
    to the broader understanding of how we can leverage sample compression in practical
    applications.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nList learning is a natural\
    \ generalization of supervised classification, in which, instead of predicting\
    \ the\ncorrect label, the learner outputs a small list of labels, one of which\
    \ should be the correct one. This approach\ncan be viewed as giving the learner\
    \ more than one guess at the correct label.\nThere are many settings in which\
    \ one may prefer the list learning approach to the classical one. For\nexample,\
    \ recommendation systems often suggest a short list of products to users, with\
    \ the hope that the\ncustomer will be interested in one of them (see Figure 1).\
    \ Another example is the top- kloss function in\nwhich the model gets kguesses\
    \ for each sample. This loss function is often used in ML competitions and\ncan\
    \ be seen as a variant of list learning. Additionally, list learning addresses\
    \ label ambiguity; for example,\nin computer vision recognition problems, it is\
    \ often impossible to determine if a certain image is of a pond\nor a river. As\
    \ a result, training a model for such problems by penalizing it for every mistake\
    \ can be too\nrestrictive. However, using a top- kapproach seems like a reasonable\
    \ alternative. This approach has been\nstudied in recent works such as Lapin,\
    \ Hein, and Schiele (2015) and Yan, Luo, Liu, Li, and Zheng (2018),\nwhich demonstrate\
    \ its usefulness in certain problems.\nList learning has also found applications\
    \ in theoretical machine learning. For example in Brukhim,\nCarmon, Dinur, Moran,\
    \ and Yehudayoff (2022) it was an essential part of establishing the equivalence\n\

    \ MORAN WAKNINE\nFigure 1: Amazon recommendation system gives their users a short\
    \ list of books based on their past reading,\naiming that one of those books will\
    \ capture their interest.\nbetween finite Daniely-Shwartz (DS) dimension and multiclass\
    \ learnability. Consequently, list learning\nhas been studied in several recent\
    \ works in learning theory. For example, Charikar and Pabbaraju (2022)\ncharacterized\
    \ list PAC learnability by using a list variant of the DS dimension, and Moran,\
    \ Sharon, Tsubari,\nand Yosebashvili (2023) characterized list online learnability\
    \ using a list variant of the Littlestone dimension.\nAnother recent application\
    \ of list learning is in the realm of multiclass boosting; Brukhim, Hanneke, and\n\
    Moran (2023) employed it to devise the first boosting algorithm whose sample complexity\
    \ is independent\nof the label space\u2019s size.\nA natural question that has\
    \ not yet been systematically addressed is the identification of fundamental\n\
    principles in list PAC learning. In the binary case, PAC learning is guided by\
    \ fundamental algorithmic prin-\nciples, notably Empirical Risk Minimization,\
    \ and Occam\u2019s Razor principles such as compression bounds. In\nthis work,\
    \ we ask which of these foundational principles remains applicable in the domain\
    \ of list learning.\n1.1. Our Contribution\nIn this section we summarize our main\
    \ methods for simultaneously handling multiple instances of\na task than addressing\
    \ them one by one. As an example, consider an n\xD7nmatrix Aand the objective\
    \ of\ncalculating its product with an input column vector x, where the computational\
    \ resource Cis the number\nof arithmetic operations. For a single vector x, it\
    \ is easy to see that \u0398(n2)operations are necessary and\nsufficient. However,\
    \ if instead of one input vector x, there are ninput vectors x1, . . . , x nthen\
    \ one can do\nbetter than n\xD7\u0398(n2)\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n   \
