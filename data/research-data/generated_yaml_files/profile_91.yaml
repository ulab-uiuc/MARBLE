  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing the interpretability of time
    series forecasting models through explainable AI techniques. My recent work focuses
    on developing frameworks that bridge the gap between complex model predictions
    and user understanding. One of my key contributions is TSFeatLIME, an extension
    of TSLIME specifically designed for univariate time series forecasting. This framework
    integrates auxiliary features and leverages pairwise Euclidean distances to improve
    the fidelity of surrogate models, making them more aligned with the original model''s
    behavior.


    Understanding the effectiveness of these explanations for diverse user groups
    is a central theme in my research. I conducted a comprehensive user study involving
    160 participants to evaluate how well individuals from various backgrounds could
    grasp and predict model outputs based on the explanations provided. The findings
    revealed that TSFeatLIME significantly enhances the ability of non-experts to
    understand model behavior, demonstrating the importance of accessible explanations
    in AI. My work aims to make advanced forecasting techniques not only powerful
    but also comprehensible, ensuring that users can effectively leverage these models
    in real-world applications.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing explainability in artificial
    intelligence (AI) and its applications across various domains. My recent work
    has focused on developing robust definitions of contrastive explanations, building
    on the foundational Halpern-Pearl framework. I have critically analyzed existing
    definitions and proposed improved variants that maintain the essence of contrastive
    explanations while addressing inherent issues.


    In the realm of reinforcement learning, I introduced Counterfactual Shapley Values
    (CSV), a novel approach that integrates counterfactual analysis with Shapley Values
    to enhance transparency in decision-making processes. My research extends to practical
    applications, such as temporal planning for smart homes, where I designed a custom
    planner that accommodates dynamic energy tariffs and user requirements, demonstrating
    the positive impact of contrastive explanations on user satisfaction.


    I have also explored the challenges of explainable AI in time series forecasting,
    developing the TSFeatLIME framework to improve the interpretability of complex
    models. My qualitative field study on AI cyberattacks revealed insights into user
    engagement with explainable AI features, highlighting the need for alignment between
    user expectations and AI capabilities.


    Additionally, I have investigated the determinism of game engines in autonomous
    vehicle simulations, identifying non-deterministic behaviors and proposing methods
    to enhance simulation precision. My work aims to bridge the gap between advanced
    AI systems and user understanding, ensuring that technology remains accessible
    and beneficial to all.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of mathematics, artificial
    intelligence, and machine learning, with a particular focus on explainability
    and decision-making in complex systems. My recent work has explored the Gaussian
    Minkowski problem, where I demonstrated that if the Gaussian surface area measure
    is proportional to the spherical Lebesgue measure, the corresponding convex body
    must be a centered disk. This foundational result has implications for understanding
    convex bodies in various dimensions.


    In the realm of artificial intelligence, I have developed novel approaches to
    enhance explainability in reinforcement learning through Counterfactual Shapley
    Values, which quantify the contributions of different state dimensions to action
    choices. My research also extends to practical applications, such as designing
    a custom planner for smart homes that incorporates contrastive explanations, significantly
    improving user satisfaction and understanding.


    I am particularly interested in addressing the challenges posed by misinformation
    in social networks. My work on predicting user engagement with misinformation
    using graph neural networks has shown promising results, leveraging continual
    learning strategies to adapt to the dynamic nature of social media.


    Additionally, I have contributed to the understanding of belief merging in AI,
    proposing a new merging operator that effectively handles uncertainty while maintaining
    consistency. My research aims to bridge theoretical advancements with practical
    applications, ensuring that complex models remain interpretable and beneficial
    in real-world scenarios. Through my work, I strive to push the boundaries of knowledge
    in both mathematical theory and its applications in AI, ultimately enhancing decision-making
    processes across various domains.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nMachine Learning (ML)\
    \ models, in particular modern large neural network architectures, are complex,\n\
    making it difficult to understand the mechanisms by which model outputs are generated.\
    \ This has led\nto the development of dedicated post-hoc analysis tools that are\
    \ commonly referred to as \u2018explainable\nartificial intelligence\u2019 (XAI).\
    \ In many cases, XAI background) [ 9], and\noften use surrogate metrics like faithfulness\
    \ instead of directly measuring explanation performance.\nMoreover, all of these\
    \ approaches leverage a continuous data generation process, yielding synthetic\n\
    numerical data unsuitable for the NLP domain, where, by nature, the data generation\
    \ process is\ndiscrete and not straightforwardly defined.\nFor the NLP domain,\
    \ feature attributions results with central tendency (e.g. mean) and variation\
    \ (e.g. error\nbars). [Yes]\n(e) The average runtime for each result, or estimated\
    \ energy cost. [Yes]\n(f) A description of the computing infrastructure used.\
    \ [Yes] Methods in Natural\nLanguage Processing , pages 2979\u20132989, Copenhagen,\
    \ Denmark, Sept. 2017. Association for\nComputational Linguistics.\n14A Appendix\n\
    A.1 GECO Dataset\nIn the following we describe the data generation and format\
    \ in more detail and perform a bias analysis\nas a sanity check to verify the\
    \ dataset is unbiased.\nA.1.1 Data Generation\nWe accessed the top 100 list of\
    \ popular books on Project Gutenberg on 17th of March 2022 and to\nobtain the\
    \ corresponding wikipedia articles we ran google queries. For the task of web\
    \ scraping, we\nuse the software Selenium8. After scraping the sentences from\
    \ the wikipedia articles of the books,\nwe preprocess the sentences using the\
    \ Python library Spacy9.\nIn the following, we provide addtional details of our\
    \ data processing rules as part of the data generation\nprocess. We employ Spacy\
    \ to only include sentences with root verbs in the 3rd person singular.\nBy applying\
    \ a set of filtering criteria to the raw sentences, we remove sentences that are\
    \ overly long\n(> 30 tokens), where the subject is neutral, usually expressed\
    \ via the word \u2019it\u2019, lack punctuation\n(no period at the end), mention\
    \ author names, or contain duplicate information. We also exclude\nsentences without\
    \ common nouns related to humans, those where the subject is not part of the plot,\n\
    and those containing citations or proper nouns that appear only once, as these\
    \ elements may not\ncontribute significantly to the story\u2019s narrative.\n\
    We ensure that the subject of a sentence either corresponds to proper nouns, pronouns\
    \ \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019,\nor common nouns referring to a human beeing.\
    \ Furthermore, we make certain that sentences are\ngrammatically consistent and\
    \ that the content of a sentence is part of the plot and does not contain\nother\
    \ trivia about the author or book interpretations. The labeling step consists\
    \ of locating the subject\nand other protagonists of a sentence and changing them\
    \ to their male or female version, respectively.\nWe attempted to employ fully\
    \ automated sentence labeling using GPT-4 [ 36], but encountered\ninconsistencies\
    \ in identifying names, genders and gendered terms, as well as detecting human\n\
    subjects, particularly in dataset DS. Due to the need for precise ground truth\
    \ labels to benchmark\nvarious explanation discussion can be found in the appendix\
    \ A.1.3, which confirmed that GECO exhibits no significant\nbias with respect\
    \ to gender.\n4 experiments on dataset DAare often able to offset\nthese Experiments\
    \ and Results\nWe conduct Discussion\nWith GECO and GECOBench, we propose a rigorous\
    \ open framework for benchmarking the cor-\nrectness of explanations of pre-trained\
    \ language models\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature\
