  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\n\n\n(a) chatGPT.\n\
    \n\n\n\n(b) Gemini Ultra.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \nA real-world example of Crescendo\
    \ for the Molotov task with ChatGPT (1(a)) and Gemini Ultra (1(b)), compared to\
    \ the baseline approach of directly requesting the task. See full examples at[1,\
    \ 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their\
    \ adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google,\
    \ and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the\
    \ security\_[27, 33] and privacy risks\_[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these\
    \ LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201Cjailbreaks\u201D\
    . Most LLMs are safety-aligned\_[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid\
    \ performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general.\
    \ Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary\
    \ malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based\
    \ jailbreaks\_[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent\
    \ the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access\
    \ to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like\
    \ GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate\
    \ such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\_\
    [27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or\
    \ triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201CDo Anything Now\u201D\
    \ (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced\
    \ tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback\
    \ of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend\
    \ against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content.\
    \ In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo\
    \ is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise\
    \ the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to\
    \ follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated\
    \ by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously\
    \ with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple\
    \ interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content\
    \ in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of\
    \ Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against\
    \ even after being discovered. Figure\_1 presents an illustration of real examples\
    \ of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront\
    \ would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo\
    \ leads the LLM to perform the task. The complete conversations are available\
    \ at [1, 2].\n\n\nTo validate and assess Crescendo\u2019s effectiveness, we evaluate\
    \ it against current state-of-the-art LLMs, ranging from open-source models like\
    \ LLaMA-2 70b and LLaMA-3 70b to closed-source ones such as Gemini-Pro, Claude-2,\
    \ Claude-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we start by manually\
    \ executing Crescendo on a subset of the tasks listed in Table\_1 against all\
    \ models. Our findings confirm that Crescendo can indeed overcome the safety alignment\
    \ of all models for nearly all tasks (Table\_2).\nMoreover, we show that once\
    \ a multimodal model, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is jailbroken using Crescendo,\
    \ it can be used for different modality tasks, such as generating images that\n\
