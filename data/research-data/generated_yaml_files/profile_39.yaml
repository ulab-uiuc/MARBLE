    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nIon migration inside\
    \ various devices, such as all-solid-\nstate batteries and atomic switches [1\u2013\
    3], is achieved by\napplying external forces from applied electric fields. Nu-\n\
    merous studies elaborating the stability of materials and\nthe mobility of ions\
    \ have been conducted using theoret-\nical calculations because these aspects\
    \ are directly re-\nlated to device performance. To further advance our\nunderstanding\
    \ of the operating mechanisms of such ion-\nconducting devices, atomic-scale analyses\
    \ of ionic motion\nin device operating circumstances, that is, under electric\n\
    fields, are crucial.\nAssuming a linear response, external forces arising\nfrom\
    \ applied electric fields can be estimated simply by\nmultiplying the electric\
    \ field vector by the valence states\nof the ions. In electronic state calculations,\
    \ such as den-\nsity functional theory (DFT) calculations, the valence\nstates\
    \ are often evaluated, for instance, using Mulliken\ncharges from the coefficients\
    \ of atomic orbitals [4] or\nBader charges using charge density distributions\
    \ [5]. By\ncontrast, the Born effective charges are defined from the\ninduced\
    \ polarisation in a periodic system by their atomic\ndisplacements (see Fig. 1(a)),\
    \ or are equivalently de-\nfined from the induced atomic forces with respect to\
    \ the\napplied electric fields. As our current interest lies in\nanalysing ion\
    \ motion under applied electric fields, and the\nlatter definition precisely corresponds\
    \ to the target situ-\nation, Born effective charges, rather than static valence\n\
    \u2217shimizu@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\u2020watanabe@cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jpstates,\
    \ are the suitable physical quantities to evaluate the\nexternal forces acting\
    \ on the ions. In addition, the Born\neffective charges can be quantified as the\
    \ number of each\natom without the arbitrariness of the decomposition of\nthe\
    \ total charges. In most cases, these per-atom quanti-\nties are compatible with\
    \ the computational processes of\ndynamic calculations using the methods include\
    \ the high-dimensional neural network po-\ntential (NNP) [6], Gaussian approximation\
    \ potential [7],\nmoment tensor potential [8], and spectral neighbour anal-\n\
    ysis potential [9]. Numerous studies have demonstrated\nthat ML potentials optimised\
    \ using DFT calculation data\ncan predict various physical quantities comparable\
    \ to\nthose of DFT calculations at low computational costs\n[10\u201313]. Notably,\
    \ in their applications to solid electrolyte\nmaterials, the predicted ionic conductivities\
    \ agree well\nwith both the DFT and experimental RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nFirst,\
    \ we constructed the NNP using a network archi-\ntecture of 125 input nodes, two\
    \ hidden layers with 15\nnodes, and one output node, [125-15-15-1], for each el-\n\
    emental species. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs)\nof the total energies and\
    \ atomic forces were 3.34 (2.91)\nmeV/atom and 86.1 (87.9) meV/ \u02DAA, respectively,\
    \ for the\nrandomly chosen 90% (10%) of the training (test) data.4\nFIG. 3. Calculated\
    \ MSDs of Li vacancy model (Li 47P16O64).\nThe MD simulations with temperature\
    \ of 800 K (a) without\nelectric field and (b) with Ez= 0.1 V/ \u02DAA, where\
    \ the MSDs\nare separately shown for each element. The MSDs of Li are\nseparately\
    \ shown for (c) xandyand (d) zcomponents.\nThe obtained RMSE values were sufficiently\
    \ small com-\npared with those of other studies using NNP [14, 15].\nPlease refer\
    \ to Fig. S1 for a comparison between the\nNNP predictions and DFT reference values.\
    \ The hyper-\nparameters used in the SFs are listed in Tables S1 and\nS2.\nNext,\
    \ we constructed the proposed NN model for the\nBorn effective charge predictor.\
    \ We used the NN archi-\ntecture of [180-10-10-1], where the RMSEs of the train-\n\
    ing (randomly chosen 90%) and test (remaining 10%)\ndata were 0.0378 e/atom and\
    \ 0.0376 e/atom, respec-\ntively. Tables S3 and S4 present the hyperparameters\n\
