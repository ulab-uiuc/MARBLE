  profile: 'As a researcher deeply engaged in the intersection of machine learning
    and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), I focus on the critical need for
    transparency and accountability in high-stakes applications, particularly in fields
    like medicine. My work critically examines the current state of XAI, revealing
    that many popular methods fall short in providing reliable insights into machine
    learning models. I argue that these methods often misattribute importance to input
    features that do not correlate with the prediction target, which undermines their
    utility for model validation, improvement, and scientific discovery.


    I advocate for a paradigm shift in how we approach XAI: researchers must first

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nSkin diseases affect\
    \ a third of the global population [Hay et al., 2014] and are the fourth leading\
    \ cause of disability\nworldwide [Karimkhani et al., 2017]. The increasing demand\
    \ for dermatological care is exacerbated by the low\nperformance of general practitioners\
    \ when diagnosing skin conditions [Federman et al., 1999], and by the global scarcity\n\
    of expert dermatologists [Feng et al., 2018, Kringos et al., 2015].\nAutomation\
    \ may help alleviate this problem. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have\
    \ been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological\
    \ conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al.,\
    \ 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less\
    \ experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl\
    \ et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism\
    \ [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their\
    \ adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et\
    \ al., 2019, Topol, 2019]. A good explanation is\nexpected to be both plausible\
    \ , i.e. as similar as possible to a human explanation, and faithful , i.e. to\
    \ accurately represent\nthe inner workings of the network [Jacovi and Goldberg,\
    \ 2020].\nDifferent mechanisms for explaining ConvNet decisions have been proposed\
    \ [Simonyan et al., 2014, Selvaraju et al.,\n2017, Ribeiro et al., 2016]. Within\
    \ the medical imaging literature, the most common explainability Related work\n\
    Machine learning-based dermatological diagnosis systems have been widely investigated,\
    \ achieving experiments, we use an Ef\uFB01cientNet-B2 [Tan and Le, 2019] ConvNet\
    \ pre-trained on\nthe ImageNet image recognition dataset [Deng et al., 2009] for\
    \ feature extraction, with all layers \uFB01ne-tuned on the\nDermXDB data. Both\
    \ models were trained for 93 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and\
    \ Hutter, 2018],\nthe cosine annealing with warm restarts learning rate scheduler\
    \ [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016], and a starting learning\nrate of 0.0005. Within\
    \ the dense block we use linear layers with 64 neurons, dropout layers with 0.2\
    \ probability, and\nReLU activations. DermX is trained with \x15D= 1,\x15C= 1,\
    \ while DermX+ uses \x15D= 1,\x15C= 1, and\x15A= 10 .\nFurther information about\
    \ the hyper-parameters used for training and other implementation details can\
    \ be found in introduction of a structured ontology for\nthe diagnosis explanations\
    \ to avoid manual processing of typos and synonyms.\nDiagnosis and explanation\
    \ ontology Preliminary investigations also highlighted the importance of having\
    \ a con-\nsistent explanation ontology. After analyzing free-text explanations,\
    \ they were formalized as an extended list of skin\nlesion characteristics [Nast\
    \ et al., 2016]. The characteristics set was selected to suf\uFB01ciently explain\
    \ the six target\ndiseases [Oakley, 2017]. With the help of two senior dermatologists,\
    \ several other relevant characteristics were added.\nThe resulting set of characteristics\
    \ was split into non-localizable characteristics (e.g. age or sex), localizable\
    \ charac-\nteristics (e.g. plaque or open comedo), and additional descriptive\
    \ terms (e.g. red or well-circumscribed), according\nto the International League\
    \ of Dermatological Societies\u2019 classi\uFB01cation [Nast et al., 2016]. Figure\
    \ 3 illustrates the\n\uFB01nal DermXDB explanation taxonomy, while more information\
    \ about the other two types of labels is available in Appendix Tables 18, 19,\
    \ 20, and 21. DermX performs adequately well on all characteristics. DermX+\n\
    is better at localizing large characteristics, e.g. patches or scales, but performs\
    \ poorly on smaller characteristics, e.g.\nopen and closed comedones.\n\n    \

    \ provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state\
