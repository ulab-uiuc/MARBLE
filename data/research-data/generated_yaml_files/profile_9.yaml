  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to integrating large language models (LLMs)
    into industrial automation systems, with a focus on enhancing task automation,
    flexibility, and intelligent planning. My recent work explores the intersection
    of LLMs, digital twins, and production processes, where I have developed frameworks
    that enable LLM agents to interpret production-specific data and generate executable
    process plans. By retrofitting automation systems and creating digital twins,
    I empower LLMs to orchestrate complex tasks autonomously, significantly improving
    the adaptability of production environments.


    One of my notable contributions is the design of a multi-agent system that utilizes
    LLMs for the parametrization of simulation models in digital twins. This framework
    not only enhances usability but also reduces cognitive load on users by assisting
    in complex decision-making. I have also tackled the challenge of semantic interoperability
    in digital twins, creating a system that automates the generation of Asset Administration
    Shells (AAS) from raw textual data, demonstrating a high success rate in translating
    technical information into digital models.


    Additionally, I have explored decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning
    to address the complexities of multi-robot tasks, proposing innovative methods
    that achieve near-centralized performance in real-world applications. My research
    aims to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and practical industrial
    applications, paving the way for smarter, more efficient production systems. You
    can find demos and further details of my work on my GitHub repositories.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nFoundation models are\
    \ general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are\
    \ designed\nto support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many\
    \ modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of\
    \ two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive\
    \ scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\n\
    and(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions,\
    \ align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example,\
    \ coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models\
    \ for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports\
    \ multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\n\
    Transformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of\
    \ up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the Results\n\
    For speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input\
    \ streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and\
    \ prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam\
    \ is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n\
    21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for\
    \ Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which\
    \ could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were\
    \ for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed\
    \ that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach\
    \ for methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are\
    \ driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost\
    \ fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing\
    \ 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than\
    \ earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023),\
    \ due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\n\
    et al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models,\
    \ such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\n\
    Small models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models.\
    \ Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify\
    \ deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models\
    \ achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\n\
    effectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative\
    \ path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al.,\
    \ 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations\
    \ to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other\
    \ designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017;\
    \ Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an\
    \ efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang\
    \ et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models,\
    \ suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\n\
    numerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability\
