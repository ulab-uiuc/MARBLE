  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nHumans use all\
    \ facial expressions, body motions, and hand motions to express our emotions and\
    \ intentions, and interact with other people and objects.\nIn particular, facial\
    \ expressions and hand gestures are one of the most powerful channels for non-verbal\
    \ communication, and hand motions are necessary to interact with diverse types\
    \ of objects.\nModeling the facial expression, body motion, and hand motion altogether\
    \ is extremely challenging.\nSeveral whole-body 3D human geometry models have\
    \ been introduced\_[21, 37, 50, 2].\nAmong them, SMPL-X\_[37] is the most widely\
    \ used one, which motivated a number of 3D whole-body pose estimation methods\_\
    [9, 45, 11, 32, 52, 26, 28, 4] and benchmarks\_[36].\n\n\nTo represent 3D humans\
    \ beyond the minimally clothed parametric models, personalized 3D human avatars\
    \ have been recently studied.\nThe 3D human avatar is a representation that combines\
    \ 3D geometry and the appearance of a certain person, which can be animated and\
    \ rendered with novel poses.\nHowever, most of existing 3D human avatars\_[39,\
    \ 38, 25, 8, 6, 20, 15, 19, 24, 18] modeled from a casually captured video only\
    \ support body motions without facial expressions and hand motions.\nTheir avatars\
    \ bake facial expressions and hand poses, and animating them is not possible.\n\
    A recent work\_[47] introduced a whole-body avatar that supports animation with\
    \ facial expressions, and body and hand poses; however, it requires 3D observations,\
    \ such as 3D scans or RGBD images with highly accurate SMPL-X registrations, with\
    \ diverse poses and facial expressions.\nSuch an assumption does not hold for\
    \ the majority of casually captured videos in daily life.\n\n\nFigure 1: \nFrom\
    \ (a) a monocular video from a single person, we create our (b) ExAvatar, an expressive\
    \ whole-body 3D avatar, animatable with novel facial expression code, hand poses,\
    \ and body poses of SMPL-X.\n\n\n\nWe present ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body\
    \ 3D human avatar that can be made from a short monocular video.\nExAvatar is\
    \ designed as a combination of the whole-body 3D parametric model (SMPL-X)\_[37]\
    \ and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\_[22].\nIt utilizes the whole-body drivability\
    \ of SMPL-X and the photorealistic and efficient rendering capability of 3DGS.\n\
    After the training, it is animatable with novel facial expression code and 3D\
    \ pose of SMPL-X, as shown in Fig.\_1.\nDespite its desired properties, modeling\
    \ ExAvatar is an non-trivial task with the following two challenges: 1) a limited\
    \ diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of\
    \ 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD videos.\nThe limited diversity in\
    \ the video makes a drivability with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial.\n\
    In addition, the absence of 3D observations creates ambiguity in the occluded\
    \ human parts, exhibiting noticeable artifacts in novel facial expressions and\
    \ poses.\n\n\nTo address them, we propose a novel hybrid representation of the\
    \ surface mesh and 3D Gaussians in ExAvatar.\nOur hybrid representation treats\
    \ each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface, where the vertices have pre-defined\
    \ connectivity (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology\
    \ of SMPL-X.\nExisting volumetric avatars\_[39, 38, 25, 8, 6, 20, 15, 19, 47]\
    \ do not have the connectivity by the definition.\nAlso, previous 3DGS-based\_\
    [24, 18] works consider a set of 3D Gaussian points as a point cloud without considering\
    \ the connectivity between them.\n\n\nUsing our hybrid representation, our\n\n\
