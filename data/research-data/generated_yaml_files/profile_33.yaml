  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION Neural networks are mathematical\
    \ models that simulate the way neurons operate in the brain. The first neural\
    \ network structure to emerge was the feedforward neural network (FNN) [1], which\
    \ typically consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. When an FNN\
    \ receives input, the input layer nodes receive the input information and map\
    \ it, then pass the mapped information through the connections between layers\
    \ to the next layer of neurons. The entire training process of the FNN repeats\
    \ the above steps between layers until the model converges. After training, we\
    \ can use the trained FNN to predict test data. In the past, FNNs have been widely\
    \ used to handle various problems involving formatted data and have achieved great\
    \ success. However, with the development of network technology, the information\
    \ carriers we face are no longer limited to numbers. Text, images, and even videos\
    \ are often the data sources encountered in practice. For such data, FNNs cannot\
    \ process and learn effectively, so we prefer neural network structures that can\
    \ directly handle these unstructured data sources. Taking images as an example,\
    \ the most common image resolution we encounter is 19201080. If we use a 19201080\
    \ image as the learning data for the neural network, then for the FNN, the number\
    \ of neurons in the input layer would be as high as 2,073,600. If we also consider\
    \ the number of neurons in each hidden layer, then the number of parameters for\
    \ the entire FNN would be very large. Such a model with a huge number of parameters\
    \ is very difficult for us to train or deploy. To solve this problem, CNN was\
    \ proposed in 1998. CNNs differ from FNNs in that they can accept matrices as\
    \ input. When using neural networks to process image problems, computers usually\
    \ process the image into multiple channels of matrices and then input them into\
    \ the CNN for learning [2]. The mapping of data by neurons in CNNs is different\
    \ from that in FNNs. Convolutional kernels (filters) are introduced in CNNs, which\
    \ are matrices of a fixed size. Convolutional kernels map the image information\
    \ by multiplying and summing with the corresponding pixel positions to extract\
    \ information from the image. By introducing different convolutional kernels,\
    \ each kernel learns different features, which allows the image to be reorganized\
    \ from various aspects into a form of numerical information that computers can\
    \ understand and further analyze to solve the problems we expect neural networks\
    \ to solve. Over the past few decades, thanks to the development of CNNs, various\
    \ AI-driven machines have acquired capabilities similar to human eyes and have\
    \ successfully performed common computer vision tasks such as medical image recognition\
    \ in survival prediction [3], few-shot description[4], and scene segmentation\
    \ [5]. Looking back at the development of CNNs, it is not difficult to find that\
    \ the existing CNN structures are very different from the beginning. In terms\
    \ of depth improvement, there are neural networks represented by ResNet, Inception,\
    \ and DenseNet; in terms of channel information utilization improvement, there\
    \ are neural networks represented by SENet and ShuffleNet; in terms of attention\
    \ improvement, there are neural networks\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n    \
