  profile: 'I am a researcher specializing in natural language processing (NLP) with
    a particular focus on machine translation (MT) and the integration of large language
    models (LLMs) into this domain. My recent work explores the synergy between LLMs
    and supervised MT systems, leveraging external feedback to enhance translation
    quality. By fine-tuning models like LLaMA-2, I have demonstrated significant improvements
    in translation metrics across multiple language pairs, including Chinese-English
    and English-German.


    I am also deeply invested in cross-lingual representation learning, where I introduced
    the concept of semantic leakage and developed the ORACLE training objective to
    improve the alignment of contextual representations in multilingual embeddings.
    My research extends to innovative prompting strategies, such as Cross-lingual
    QA, which optimize the use of in-context examples without compromising contextual
    integrity.


    Additionally, I have addressed practical challenges in lexically-constrained neural
    machine translation (LNMT) by developing a homograph disambiguation module and
    the PLUMCOT framework, which enhances the model''s ability to handle unseen lexical
    constraints. My work culminates in the creation of HOLLY, a benchmark for evaluating
    LNMT models under real-world conditions.


    Beyond these technical contributions, I am committed to advancing the understanding
    of prompting techniques in generative AI systems, establishing a structured taxonomy
    that clarifies the diverse methodologies in this rapidly evolving field. My goal
    is to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, driving innovation
    in multilingual NLP.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of natural language
    processing (NLP) and machine learning, with a particular focus on cross-lingual
    sentence embeddings, traffic forecasting, and machine translation. My recent work
    has explored the intricacies of semantic representation, leading to the development
    of ORACLE, a novel training objective that effectively reduces semantic leakage
    in multilingual embeddings. I have also tackled the challenges of traffic prediction
    by introducing ResCAL, a residual estimation module that enhances existing models
    by capturing autocorrelated errors.


    In the realm of machine translation, I have pioneered personalized automatic post-editing
    frameworks that adapt translations to individual user preferences, and I have
    investigated domain adaptation strategies to optimize neural machine translation
    models. My research extends to understanding crowd movement patterns in urban
    environments, where I developed the PASTA model to predict city-wide crowd flows.


    I am passionate about bridging the gap between deep learning models and real-world
    applications, as demonstrated by my work on visual analytics systems like AttnAnalyzer,
    which helps users interpret model behaviors in traffic forecasting. Additionally,
    I have contributed to the development of HyperCLOVA X, a family of large language
    models tailored to the Korean language, showcasing my commitment to enhancing
    multilingual capabilities in AI.


    Through my research, I aim to address complex challenges in NLP and machine learning,
    ultimately contributing to more effective and user-centered technologies.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the study of intercellular signaling,
    foraging behavior in eusocial species, and the mathematical modeling of complex
    biological systems. My recent work has focused on understanding the energy efficiency
    of different signaling mechanisms, revealing how direct transport can outperform
    diffusion under certain conditions. This insight has implications for long-range
    cellular communication and the optimization of signaling pathways.


    In addition to signaling, I have developed models to analyze the dynamics of group
    foraging, demonstrating how communication strategies can lead to inefficiencies
    in finite populations. This work bridges the gap between biological behavior and
    mathematical theory, particularly in the context of multi-agent systems.


    My research also extends to Turing pattern formation in reaction-diffusion-advection
    systems, where I explore how stochastic dynamics can influence synaptogenesis
    in organisms like *C. elegans*. By applying advanced mathematical techniques,
    I have shown how noise can enhance the emergence of spontaneous patterns, contributing
    to our understanding of developmental processes.


    Furthermore, I have investigated cover times in search processes, providing new
    insights into how multiple searchers can efficiently explore spatial regions.
    My findings challenge existing assumptions in the literature and offer a universal
    formula for cover times that is applicable across various contexts.


    Overall, my work integrates theoretical modeling with biological applications,
    aiming to uncover the underlying principles that govern complex systems in nature.
    I am passionate about advancing our understanding of these phenomena and contributing
    to interdisciplinary research that bridges biology, mathematics, and computational
    science.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nUniversal cross-lingual\
    \ sentence embeddings map\nthe sentences from multiple languages into a\nshared\
    \ embedding space, where semantically sim-\nilar sentences across languages are\
    \ close to each\nother. These embeddings have a wide spectrum\nof applications\
    \ such as multi-lingual document re-\ntrieval (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019a; Lin\
    \ et al.,\n2020), multi-lingual question answering (Asai\net al., 2021a,b; Kumar\
    \ et al., 2022), unsupervised\nmachine translation (Tran et al., 2020), and zero-\n\
    shot transfer learning (Phang et al., 2020).\nAs shown in Figure 1 (a), without\
    \ \uFB01netuning\non downstream tasks, the embedding space of pre-\ntrained multilingual\
    \ language models such as m-\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) or XLM-R (Conneau\net\
    \ al., 2020) separate the embeddings of each lan-\nguage into different clusters.\

    ntuned on En-\nglish NLI data.\nFigure 1: We visualize the sentence embeddings\
    \ on\nXNLI corpus, where blue dots and green dots denote\nthe sentences from English\
    \ and Swahili respectively.\nHere, red dots, black dots, and purple dots denote\
    \ the\nparallel sentences from different languages. In (a),\nthe sentence embeddings\
    \ from different languages are\nclearly separated into two clusters. In (b), after\
    \ English\nNLI training, the embedding space becomes indistin-\nguishable for\
    \ different languages, and the parallel sen-\ntences are aligned to each other.\n\
    sentence embeddings, previous work (Artetxe and\nSchwenk, 2019a; Chidambaram et\
    \ al., 2019; Feng\net al., 2020) \uFB01netunes multilingual language mod-\nels\
    \ with billions of parallel data. However, it is\nnon-trivial to obtain numerous\
    \ parallel data for all\nlanguages. One potential direction to alleviate the\n\
    need for parallel data is to enhance cross-lingual\ntransfer of sentence embeddings.\n\
    Pre-trained multilingual language models (Pires\net al., 2019; Phang et al., 2020)\
    \ have shown im-\npressive performance on cross-lingual zero-shot\ntransfer (Pires\
    \ et al., 2019) that a model \uFB01netuned\non a source language can generalize\
    \ to target lan-\nguages. This implies the representations \uFB01netuned\non downstream\
    \ tasks are universal across various\nlanguages. In this work, we explore various\
    \ cross-\nlingual transfer settings on sentence retrieval tasks,\nespecially in\
    \ the setting of using English data only.\nWe propose multilingual-SimCSE (mSimCSE)\n\
    which extends SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021), a fa-\nmous sentence embedding method\
    \ on English, to\nmultilingual for cross-lingual transfer. SimCSE isarXiv:2211.06127v1\

    SimCSE, we obtain positive training pairs by either\nnatural language inference\
    \ (NLI) (Conneau et al.,\n2017; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) supervision or\nunsupervised\
    \ data augmentation using dropout. We\nalso investigate model performance when\
    \ a small\namount of parallel data or cross-lingual NLI data\nare available.\n\
    In our experiments.\nWe use our method to \uFB01netune XLM-Roberta-large\n(XLM-R)\
