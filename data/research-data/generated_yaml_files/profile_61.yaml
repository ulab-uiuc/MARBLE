  profile: 'I am a researcher deeply engaged in the fields of combinatorics, graph
    theory, and number theory, with a particular focus on problems related to geometric
    progressions, Ramsey theory, and graph invariants. My work has explored the existence
    of $k$-GP-free sequences, where I have contributed to understanding the conditions
    under which such sequences can be constructed with bounded gaps. I have also investigated
    quasirandomness in graphs, providing insights into the relationship between labeled
    copies of subgraphs and edge distributions.


    My research extends to the study of rotor-router networks, where I have classified
    universal rotor types and introduced new classes of rotors to better understand
    their properties. Additionally, I have made significant strides in the area of
    zero-sum sequences in finite abelian groups, proving upper bounds for the smallest
    integers that guarantee zero-sum subsequences.


    I have also tackled problems in the realm of graph colorings, particularly addressing
    Tomescu''s conjecture and its implications for connected graphs. My recent work
    includes developing probabilistic constructions for hypergraphs and exploring
    the hat-guessing number of various graph classes, contributing to a deeper understanding
    of these intriguing mathematical structures.


    Overall, my research is characterized by a blend of theoretical exploration and
    practical applications, aiming to uncover new relationships and bounds within
    combinatorial mathematics. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of
    these complex topics and contributing to the broader mathematical community.'

  profile: I am a researcher specializing in federated learning and optimization techniques.
    My recent work focuses on enhancing the gradient estimation process in scenarios
    where traditional gradient information is unavailable. Recognizing the limitations
    of isotropic sampling methods, I developed a non-isotropic sampling approach that
    leverages historical trajectories of solutions to improve convergence rates in
    zeroth-order federated settings. This innovative method not only encourages exploration
    of promising regions in the objective landscape but also maintains efficiency
    in communication and local computation. Through rigorous numerical experiments,
    I have demonstrated the effectiveness of my approach compared to commonly-used
    zeroth-order optimization algorithms. My goal is to contribute to the advancement
    of distributed learning frameworks, making them more robust and efficient for
    real-world applications.

    machine learning, and graph neural networks (GNNs). My recent work focuses on
    enhancing the reliability and security of blockchain systems, particularly through
    the development of the Hybrid Blockchain Reliability Prediction model (H-BRP),

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nFine-tuning pre-trained\
    \ large language models (LLMs) has\nbecome the de-facto standard in the current\
    \ paradigms of\nnatural language processing (NLP) (Raffel et al., 2023; Sanh\n\
    et al., 2022). First-order (FO) optimizers, e.g., SGD (Amari,\n1993) and Adam\
    \ (Kingma & Ba, 2014), have been the pre-\ndominant choices for LLM fine-tuning.\
    \ However, as LLMs\ncontinue to scale, they encounter significant memory over-\n\
    head due to the back-propagation (BP) required for FO gra-\ndient computation.\
    \ For example, computing the gradient of\nthe LLM OPT-13B requires 12\xD7more\
    \ memory cost than\nthe model inference. This leads to the challenge of achiev-\n\
    ingmemory-efficient fine-tuning in LLMs. Advancements in\naddressing this challenge\
    \ could also facilitate technological\nbreakthroughs in related areas, such as\
    \ on-device training,\nwhere memory efficiency is in high demand (Han et al.,\n\
    2015; Zhu et al., 2023).\nTo enhance memory efficiency, an emerging solution is\
    \ to\nreplace a BP-required FO optimization method with a BP-\nfreeoptimizer during\
    \ LLM fine-tuning. This was initially\nproposed by Malladi et al. (2023), where\
    \ the FO gradient\nis approximated using a finite difference of function values.\n\
    Despite its new application to LLM fine-tuning, the under-\nlying optimization\
    \ principle used in Malladi et al. (2023) is\ncommonly known as zeroth-order (ZO)\
    \ optimization , and\nthe function value-based gradient estimate is referred to\
    \ as\nthe ZO gradient estimate (Flaxman et al., 2005; Nesterov &\nSpokoiny, 2017;\
    \ Duchi et al., 2015; Ghadimi & Lan, 2013;\nLiu et al., 2020). Malladi et al.\
    \ (2023) employed the clas-\nsical ZO stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD) algorithm\n\
    (Ghadimi & Lan, 2013), termed MeZO, to fine-tune the\npre-trained LLMs and leveraged\
    \ the BP-free characteris-\ntics of ZO optimization to reduce memory costs. However,\n\
    from the perspective of ZO optimization, in addition to ZO-\nSGD, many other ZO\
    \ optimization Related Work\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Early ef-\n\
    forts (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020) involved\ninserting trainable adapters,\
    \ which are compact feed-\nforward networks, between the layers of the pre-trained\n\
    model. More recently, various PEFT strategies have been\nproposed. For instance,\
    \ Adapter -based background, the RGE \u02C6\u2207f(x)can be inter-\npreted as\
    \ an approximation of the FO gradient \u2207f(x)using\nthe directional derivative.\n\
    Forward gradient: A missing BP-free baseline in LLM\nfine-tuning. As a byproduct\
    \ of connecting RGE to (1),\n3Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient\
    \ LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark\nwe obtain the directional derivative-based gradient\
    \ estimate,\n\u2207f(x)\u2248f\u2032(x,u)u, which is known as the forward gradi-\n\
    ent(Forward-Grad ) (Baydin et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2022).\nDifferent from RGE\
    \ that relies solely on the finite differ-\nence of function values, Forward-Grad\
    \ requires the use of\nforward mode automatic differentiation (AD) but eliminates\n\
    the need for backward evaluation in the implementation of\ndeep model fine-tuning\
    \ or training. In other words, Forward-\nGrad is BP-free and can serve as another\
    \ alternative gradient\nestimation method that improves the memory efficiency\
    \ of\nLLM fine-tuning. We stress that Forward-Grad is a possibly\noverlooked BP-free\
    \ optimizer. Given its unbiasedness as\nshown in (1), it could serve as an upper\
    \ performance bound\nfor ZO optimization in theory.\nA focused spectrum of ZO\
