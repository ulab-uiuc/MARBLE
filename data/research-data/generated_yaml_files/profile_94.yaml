  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing the challenges posed by the
    exponential growth of internet traffic and the complexities of cybersecurity in
    the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape. My recent work focuses on developing advanced
    predictive models for internet traffic volume estimation, utilizing deep sequence
    methods combined with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and K-Nearest Neighbour
    (KNN) techniques. This innovative approach not only enhances the accuracy of traffic
    predictions but also aids Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in making informed
    decisions regarding network planning and investments.


    In addition to traffic forecasting, I am passionate about creating robust security
    frameworks for IoT environments. My latest research introduces a comprehensive
    real-time attack detection and response system that integrates Machine Learning,
    Explainable AI (XAI), and Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging XAI techniques
    like SHAP and LIME, I ensure that our framework provides interpretable and actionable
    insights for system administrators, bridging the gap between model development
    and real-world application.


    Through my work, I aim to contribute to the fields of network management and cybersecurity,
    providing scalable and interpretable solutions that can adapt to the evolving
    challenges of the digital landscape. My research not only addresses immediate
    technical needs but also emphasizes the importance of understanding and interpreting
    machine learning models in practical settings.'
