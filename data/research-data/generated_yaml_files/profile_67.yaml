  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.


    In addition to static graphs, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs
    through the ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static
    GNNs to dynamic environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning
    (AutoML), where I introduced FALCON and AutoTransfer to streamline the search
    for optimal model designs across various tasks, significantly reducing computational
    costs.

    protocols analysis [ 8,11] and a choice of the datasets for SRSs\nevaluation [8,\
    \ 30].\nAccording to [ 8], one of the core evaluation issues is the dataset-\n\
    task mismatch, as the sequential recommendations only make sense\nif the data\
    \ has sequential patterns. Thus, the datasets for SRS evalu-\nation should be\
    \ analyzed to determine the presence of such patterns.\nTo the best of our knowledge,\
    \ there are no well-established criteria\nto assess how good the dataset is for\
    \ SRS evaluation. In our work,\nwe aim to highlight the importance of determining\
    \ the strength of\nsequential patterns during dataset selection and propose criteria\n\
    for such assessment.\nWe propose to use three approaches to analyze the strength\
    \ of\nsequential patterns. These approaches are based on the assumption\nthat\
    \ the sequential patterns in the dataset will be broken if the in-\nteractions\
    \ in user sequences are shuffled in random order. Thus, we\ncan estimate the strength\
    \ of the sequential structure by comparing\nchosen metrics acquired on shuffled\
    \ and unshuffled versions of\ndata.\nThe first approach, based on identifying\
    \ sequential rules, is sim-\nple and model-agnostic. Two others consist of training\
    \ a sequential\nmodel (SASRec and GRU4Rec in our experiments show that many\n\
    popular datasets, namely Foursquare, Gowalla, RetailRocket, Steam,\nand Yelp,\
    \ lack a sequential structure. Whether these datasets are\nsuitable for evaluating\
    \ sequential recommendations is questionable\nand needs further research.\nThe\
    \ datasets selected for evaluation must be aligned with the\ntask at hand. RELATED\
