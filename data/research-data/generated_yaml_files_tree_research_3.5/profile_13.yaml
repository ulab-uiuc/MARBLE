    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\n\n\n\n(a) chatGPT.\n\
    \n\n\n\n(b) Gemini Ultra.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \nA real-world example of Crescendo\
    \ for the Molotov task with ChatGPT (1(a)) and Gemini Ultra (1(b)), compared to\
    \ the baseline approach of directly requesting the task. See full examples at[1,\
    \ 2].\n\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have fueled their\
    \ adoption into the products of numerous companies, including Microsoft, Google,\
    \ and OpenAI. Concurrently, multiple research studies have been examining the\
    \ security\_[27, 33] and privacy risks\_[28, 9, 22, 17] associated with these\
    \ LLMs. One of the most notable security threats is the concept of \u201Cjailbreaks\u201D\
    . Most LLMs are safety-aligned\_[15, 18, 8, 24], meaning they are trained to avoid\
    \ performing illegal or unethical tasks or generating harmful content in general.\
    \ Jailbreak attacks aim to disrupt this alignment, enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary\
    \ malicious tasks.\n\n\nThere are various forms of jailbreaks. For instance, optimization-based\
    \ jailbreaks\_[33, 20], involve adversaries optimizing a suffix to circumvent\
    \ the model\u2019s safety measures. These methods mostly require white-box access\
    \ to the target LLMs, rendering them ineffective against black-box models like\
    \ GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and also demand significant computational resources to calculate\
    \ such optimizations. Another type of jailbreak relies solely on textual inputs\_\
    [27, 10, 13], where attackers craft a text input that includes instructions or\
    \ triggers, often in a one-shot setting, such as the \u201CDo Anything Now\u201D\
    \ (DAN) jailbreaks, to bypass safety regulations. Recent works [12, 31] have introduced\
    \ tools to automate the discovery of such jailbreaks.\n\n\nA significant drawback\
    \ of these jailbreaks is that once discovered, input filters can effectively defend\
    \ against them, as they often use inputs with identifiable malicious content.\
    \ In this work, we propose a new class of multi-turn jailbreaks, Crescendo. Crescendo\
    \ is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign inputs to compromise\
    \ the target model. Intuitively, Crescendo exploits the LLM\u2019s tendency to\
    \ follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, especially text generated\
    \ by the LLM itself. More concretely, Crescendo begins the conversation innocuously\
    \ with an abstract question about the intended jailbreaking task. Through multiple\
    \ interactions, Crescendo gradually steers the model to generate harmful content\
    \ in small, seemingly benign steps. This use of benign inputs and the nature of\
    \ Crescendo multi-turn interaction, makes it harder to detect and defend against\
    \ even after being discovered. Figure\_1 presents an illustration of real examples\
    \ of Crescendo on ChatGPT and Gemini Ultra, where posing the main question upfront\
    \ would result in the LLM\u2019s refusal to respond. However, applying Crescendo\
    \ leads the LLM to perform the task. The complete conversations are available\
    \ at [1, 2].\n\n\nTo validate and assess Crescendo\u2019s effectiveness, we evaluate\
    \ it against current state-of-the-art LLMs, ranging from open-source models like\
    \ LLaMA-2 70b and LLaMA-3 70b to closed-source ones such as Gemini-Pro, Claude-2,\
    \ Claude-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.\n\n\nIn this paper, we start by manually\
    \ executing Crescendo on a subset of the tasks listed in Table\_1 against all\
    \ models. Our findings confirm that Crescendo can indeed overcome the safety alignment\
    \ of all models for nearly all tasks (Table\_2).\nMoreover, we show that once\
    \ a multimodal model, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is jailbroken using Crescendo,\
    \ it can be used for different modality tasks, such as generating images that\n\
