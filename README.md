**M**ulti-**A**gent Coo**R**dination **B**ackbone with **L**LM **E**ngine


**MultiAgentBench** is a modular and extensible framework designed to facilitate the development, testing, and evaluation of multi-agent systems leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured environment where agents can interact within various simulated environments, utilizing cognitive abilities and communication mechanisms to perform tasks collaboratively or competitively.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or replace components like agents, environments, and LLM integrations.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Model complex interactions between multiple agents with hierarchical or cooperative execution modes.
- **LLM Integration**: Interface with various LLM providers (OpenAI, etc.) through a unified API.
- **Shared Memory**: Implement shared memory mechanisms for agent communication and collaboration.
- **Flexible Environments**: Support for different simulated environments like web-based tasks.
- **Metrics and Evaluation**: Built-in evaluation metrics to assess agent performance on tasks.

### Install from scratch

Use a virtual environment, e.g. with anaconda3:

```bash
conda create -n marble python=3.10
conda activate marble
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Configure environment variables
Environment variables such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `Together_API_KEY` related configs are required to run the code. The recommended way to set all the required variable is
1. Copy the `.env.template` file into the project root with the name `.env`.
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
2. Fill the required environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Running the examples
To run examples provided in the `examples`:

```bash
poetry install
cd scripts
cd werewolf
bash run_simulation.sh
```

#### New branch for each feature

`git checkout -b feature/feature-name` and PR to `main` branch.

#### Before committing

Run `poetry run pytest` to make sure all tests pass (this will ensure dynamic typing passed with beartype) and `poetry run mypy --config-file pyproject.toml .` to check static typing. (You can also run `pre-commit run --all-files` to run all checks)

#### Check github action result

Check the github action result to make sure all tests pass. If not, fix the errors and push again.
